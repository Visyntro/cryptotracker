10 Best Crypto Presales To Buy [New List] For Next Bull Run - FinanceFeeds,https://financefeeds.com/10-best-crypto-presales-to-buy-new-list-for-next-bull-run/,2024-09-30,FinanceFeeds,"Dipping your toes into the crypto world can be both exhilarating and intimidating. With countless coins, projects, and investment opportunities sprouting up almost daily, one concept that often piques the interest of newcomers is the crypto presale like the one of EarthMeta. So, what exactly is a crypto presale, and why are people buzzing about it?

Crypto presales are the phase where a new cryptocurrency project offers its tokens to early believers before they become available to the public. Think of it like an artist releasing a limited edition of their album before the official launch. By participating in a presale, adopters often get the chance to buy tokens at a discounted price, giving them the opportunity to capitalize on potential price increases once the token hits the broader market.

The main advantage of crypto presales is the opportunity for substantial returns. Early users can potentially see massive gains if the project becomes successful. The discounted token price, combined with the possibility of high demand once the coin is publicly available, makes presales an attractive option. However, it's not just about the financial benefits. Presale often give participants a sense of being part of a project from the ground up, fostering a deeper connection and involvement with the project's community.

But let's face it: buying in a presale also comes with risks. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and there's always the possibility that a new project could fail, resulting in a loss of investment. Knowing when to dive into a presale can make all the difference between a profitable venture and a costly mistake. Speaking of timing, let's explore why the year 2024 might be an opportune moment for crypto presales.

If you've been following the crypto market, you might have noticed a cyclical pattern. Bull runs followed by bear markets, each one a reaction to the other. Market analysts often talk about these cycles, and 2024 is predicted to be a year where the bulls could dominate once again. Several factors are lining up to make this year particularly favorable for crypto presales.

2024 is expected to see further advancements in blockchain technology and greater regulatory clarity. As more governments and financial institutions recognize and integrate cryptocurrencies into their systems, market confidence is likely to grow. This positive sentiment will encourage more users to participate in crypto presales, hoping to catch the next big project before it goes mainstream.

With the global economy still adapting to post-pandemic realities, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative income avenue that is becoming increasingly appealing. Inflation concerns and a search for decentralized financial solutions are pushing both retail and institutional investors towards crypto. In this environment, crypto presales could see significant participation as users seek to maximize their returns by getting in early on promising projects.

EarthMeta, probably the best crypto presale of the year, is a platform where you can buy digital land, that blends the power of the metaverse with artificial intelligence (AI) to create immersive, interactive, and highly personalized digital environments. With the ambition to change how users engage with virtual spaces, EarthMeta enables people to socialize, create content, conduct business transactions, and explore new digital worlds. The platform leverages advanced AI technology to tailor virtual experiences based on individual preferences and behaviors, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the metaverse.

At its core, EarthMeta envisions a virtual landscape that mirrors real-world geography. Similar to Google Earth, users can explore and own cities, represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which grant them digital ownership of unique pieces of virtual land. These cities can be divided into smaller parcels, which users can buy, sell, or trade, creating a dynamic marketplace for virtual real estate. However, EarthMeta takes this concept further by attaching financial rewards to ownership. City owners are entitled to a 1% tax on all transactions within their virtual city, providing a source of passive income. Moreover, the platform introduces a unique gamified layer of ownership by allowing users to rise to the status of ""President"" of a country if they own the most valuable cities within that region, granting them the ability to collect taxes on all trades occurring across the country.

A key feature that differentiates EarthMeta from other platforms is its integration of AI to enhance the metaverse experience. EarthMeta's AI algorithms are designed to analyze real-world data and adapt virtual environments to meet the specific needs and preferences of individual users. This creates a highly personalized experience where the digital world can evolve in response to user interactions, behaviors, and desires. Whether through changing landscapes or adjusting interactive features, the AI component ensures that each user's experience is unique and engaging.

To incentivize early participation, EarthMeta offers various benefits to presale users. These incentives include a 5% bonus on token purchases, the potential to earn up to 86% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) through staking, and free NFTs representing Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, giving participants a head start in the virtual real estate market. These rewards are designed to attract a diverse user base of gamers, content creators, entrepreneurs, and users, ensuring the platform gains momentum ahead of its full launch.

CYBRO is an innovative AI-powered yield aggregator built on the Blast blockchain, designed to simplify and maximize returns in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Imagine having a sophisticated AI as your personal guide, continuously working to find the best investment opportunities while minimizing risks. This is the promise of CYBRO -- making yield farming accessible and effective for everyone, regardless of their experience level.

At its core, CYBRO uses artificial intelligence to automate yield farming, which means users no longer need to navigate the complexities of DeFi themselves. Instead, CYBRO takes care of everything, analyzing the market, assessing opportunities, and allocating investments for optimal returns. The platform's AI-driven approach makes the process smarter and more efficient, allowing users to invest in various high-yield options through an intuitive interface that eliminates confusion and reduces the risks associated with manual decision-making.

CYBRO already has a growing community of over 8,926 holders who are part of a network dedicated to smart, innovative investing. By becoming part of CYBRO, users gain access to a community that is focused on building wealth together, supported by a platform that rewards their participation. For instance, those who invest $1,000 or more during the presale phase automatically qualify for the Pre-Alpha Yield Program, which offers weekly rewards in Ethereum (ETH). This makes early participation particularly attractive, as it provides ongoing income in addition to the expected growth of CYBRO's value.

One of the key reasons why CYBRO stands out is its transparent and forward-thinking roadmap. The platform launched with secure vaults designed to deliver high annual percentage yields (APYs), and it plans to introduce a range of new features. For example, the upcoming staking program will allow users to further boost their earnings by locking in their tokens for a period of time. Additionally, the platform is set to launch an AI-broker feature, which will use advanced algorithms to automatically manage leverage and maximize returns, making it even easier for users to benefit from the DeFi ecosystem.

The value of CYBRO is also reflected in its tokenomics. The total supply is set at one billion tokens, with strategic allocations aimed at ensuring the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. - CYBRO's referral program adds another layer of value. Users can earn a percentage of the purchases made by their referrals, which not only boosts their holdings but also helps grow the community. This incentive-based model aligns the interests of the users with the growth of the platform, creating a win-win situation for everyone involved.

Doge2014 is all about celebrating ten years of Dogecoin, the original meme coin that started out as a joke and became a huge hit. Think of Doge2014 like a throwback to the early days of Dogecoin. It's a new token on the Ethereum blockchain, but it lets you buy in at a price similar to what Dogecoin cost way back in 2014 -- like a nostalgic nod to anyone who missed out on those early days.

So, what can you do with Doge2014? Well, the main idea is to let people join in and celebrate Dogecoin's history. You buy the tokens during a presale, and after that, you can stake them. Staking just means holding your tokens in a special way that earns you more over time -- kind of like earning interest in a savings account, but here you're earning more Doge2014 tokens. It's a nice way to feel part of the community and grow your share as Dogecoin marks a decade in the crypto world.

Doge2014 is designed to be super easy to use. If you have a wallet like MetaMask, you can quickly add your Doge2014 tokens and start staking them right away. Everything is done on the Ethereum blockchain, so it's secure and transparent. You don't have to do anything fancy -- just hold onto your tokens, and you're part of the celebration.

There are a total of 100 billion Doge2014 tokens, and most of these (60%) are being sold in the presale. If you buy some, you're joining a community that's all about celebrating how far Dogecoin has come. Another 25% of the tokens are set aside for staking, so people who stick around and support the project get rewarded for it. Plus, they've put aside some tokens for liquidity -- basically making sure people can buy and sell Doge2014 easily without any issues -- and for marketing, to help get the word out and bring more people into the celebration.

The project has a pretty straightforward plan. First, they're starting with the presale so anyone interested can get in. After that, they're planning some marketing and community activities to make sure Doge2014 gets noticed. Then, they'll launch the token on major exchanges, which means more people will be able to buy, sell, and trade it. - Oh, and if you invest a bit more -- like $1,000 or above -- you can get some extra bonuses. They're doing an airdrop, which means they'll give away free Dogecoin to people who invest enough in Doge2014. The more the community raises, the bigger the airdrop gets, so there's a nice little incentive there.

PlayDoge is a new, play-to-earn (P2E) game that takes inspiration from two iconic things: the Doge meme and the virtual pet craze of the past, like Tamagotchi. Imagine getting your own little digital Doge that you have to take care of -- feeding it, playing with it, and keeping it happy -- just like you might have done with those old virtual pets. But there's a big difference: in PlayDoge, you get rewarded in crypto while doing all that!

The whole idea behind PlayDoge is to make taking care of a virtual pet fun and rewarding, with a twist of modern tech. You'll have your own cute, pixel-style Doge, and you'll use $PLAY tokens to unlock new adventures, earn rewards, and enjoy the game. The $PLAY token is the heart of the game. It works as the main currency that you earn by playing and use for making progress in the game.

So how does it all work? You get your digital Doge companion in the PlayDoge app, which brings you into a colorful, 8-bit-style world. Your mission is to take care of this Doge by feeding, training, and playing with it. If you do well, you'll earn $PLAY tokens, which you can use to pamper your Doge even more or just to enjoy the game's different features. It's basically like being a virtual dog owner but with the bonus that you earn tokens for taking good care of your pet.

There's also a competitive side to PlayDoge. If you're good at taking care of your Doge and completing game levels, you'll earn experience points (XP). The more XP you get, the higher you climb on the leaderboard. The top players on the leaderboard will get extra $PLAY tokens and exclusive rewards -- so it's all about keeping your Doge in top shape while playing some fun mini-games.

Speaking of the tokens, $PLAY is what you use in PlayDoge for all transactions, whether you're unlocking new features or getting special items for your pet. You can earn $PLAY by simply playing the game, taking good care of your Doge, and winning mini-games. If you don't keep up with your Doge's needs, though, you might lose out -- your digital pet might not stick around if you don't give it enough attention. So, it's important to stay active in the game if you want to keep earning and growing your rewards.

StakeLayer is taking a new approach to making Bitcoin more useful in the broader world of blockchain and DeFi. If you've ever wondered how the most decentralized and well-known digital asset -- Bitcoin -- could do more than just sit in your wallet or act as a store of value, then StakeLayer might be the answer. This platform is designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in staking activities, which traditionally were reserved for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum or Solana. This means your Bitcoin can actually generate yield, offering a new way to get more value out of your crypto holdings.

The problem that StakeLayer aims to solve is Bitcoin's current lack of participation in the DeFi world. Despite its popularity, Bitcoin hasn't been fully integrated with the smart contract and staking technologies that power today's DeFi systems. Bitcoin operates on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, which makes it very secure but not compatible with the staking and smart contracts of most DeFi platforms. StakeLayer changes this by using innovative cross-chain technology, essentially allowing Bitcoin to play in the same sandbox as Ethereum, Solana, and other PoS chains, which opens up opportunities for Bitcoin holders to earn through staking and restaking.

Think of it this way: StakeLayer enables you to use your Bitcoin beyond simple holding or trading. You can deposit your Bitcoin and use it to validate transactions on other blockchains. This cross-chain restaking functionality allows your Bitcoin to work across different PoS ecosystems, generating yield, providing security, and increasing liquidity. Essentially, it's like taking an asset that was once locked and putting it to work, benefiting both you and the blockchain networks involved.

One of the major strengths of StakeLayer is its user-friendly and secure architecture. Whether you are just getting into crypto or you are an experienced users, StakeLayer is designed to be easy to use while providing top-level security. They have partnerships with leading security firms, and their platform has undergone multiple audits to ensure that your assets are as safe as possible when staked.

So, how does this all work? It starts with staking and restaking. For the first time, Bitcoin holders can safely generate income from their assets through StakeLayer's unique restaking mechanism. You can deposit your Bitcoin into a ""vault,"" which will lock it in a way that maintains custody, and start earning returns by validating transactions on other networks. This doesn't just stop with Bitcoin; the platform also works with assets like Ethereum, Solana, and more, allowing a broader range of earning opportunities.

The $STAKE token is central to the StakeLayer ecosystem. By purchasing and holding $STAKE, users get to participate more actively in the platform, gaining extra rewards and benefiting from the growth of the entire StakeLayer project. StakeLayer's tokenomics are designed to ensure a balanced and sustainable distribution of tokens, with allocations for staking rewards, liquidity, community incentives, and development. This thoughtful distribution helps maintain stability and growth potential for the entire ecosystem.

StakeLayer is also forward-thinking in its roadmap. In 2024, the project will see its major milestones, such as the launch of the Bitcoin Restaking Layer2 solution, building partnerships within the DeFi space, and opening up the platform for community testing. This means that, as an early backer, you get a chance to be part of a major leap in Bitcoin's capabilities, potentially capturing growth as StakeLayer brings Bitcoin into the Proof-of-Stake economy.

DTX Exchange is a trading platform that brings together traditional finance and blockchain technology in a single, easy-to-use package. Imagine having a platform that combines all the best parts of trading stocks, crypto, and forex, and that's exactly what DTX aims to achieve. The heart of DTX is about making trading more accessible, more inclusive, and much more powerful by leveraging advanced technologies like the VulcanX blockchain.

The DTX Unified Wallet is your one-stop solution for managing all your assets, whether they are stocks, crypto, or forex. Think of it as a super-secure vault that lets you handle over 100,000 different financial instruments with ease. It works fast, powered by the VulcanX blockchain, and brings all your investments together in one place, making your life much simpler. No more juggling between different platforms -- now everything is at your fingertips. - One of the features of the DTX ecosystem is its simplicity and accessibility. Whether you're looking to buy in the NASDAQ or dive into forex trading, DTX provides a secure and reliable platform to do so. The products within the ecosystem are geared towards the next generation of users who want to trade smartly and efficiently.

Staking on DTX is another way to get rewarded. By staking your tokens, you support the liquidity of the blockchain and, in return, earn up to 15% APY. This is a great way to make your holdings work for you, rather than just leaving them idle. Plus, if you hold DTX tokens, you get to share in the profits of the platform through the profit-sharing program. Essentially, as the platform grows and generates revenue, part of those earnings come back to you, the token holder.

Another unique aspect of DTX is tokenized assets. This feature allows you to access exclusive trading opportunities linked to real-world applications, providing a new way to earn passive income. Tokenizing assets means you can buy in segments of things like real estate or commodities without needing to buy them outright, opening up possibilities that were once only available to big users.

DTX is also built on an innovative hybrid trading blockchain, the VulcanX. This isn't just a trading platform -- it's about bringing a whole new level of integration and utility by supporting multiple blockchain infrastructures. It means that DTX can offer benefits like trading discounts, profit-sharing, and even give you governance rights, so you can have a say in how the platform evolves.

Memereum, it's where memes meet serious financial protection. Imagine a token that not only makes you laugh but also has your back when things get shaky in the wild world of digital assets. That's what Memereum is here for: combining the fun of meme culture with the solid promise of insurance. In a time when crypto prices can swing like crazy, Memereum steps in to provide stability. It protects you not only against cryptocurrency value drops but also against broader financial issues like inflation and depreciation. Even if you've invested in precious metals like silver and gold, Memereum has got it covered, ensuring all your valuable assets are safe.

Now, about getting your hands on some Memereum tokens -- here's how it works, but no need for bullet points! During the pre-sale, you can buy tokens at a discounted rate, starting as low as $0.01 each. It's kind of like an exclusive early bird deal -- except every 72 hours, the price goes up by $0.005, so the sooner you jump in, the better the price you get. Half of all the tokens we're releasing are available during this pre-sale, and anything that doesn't get sold? Well, those get burned, making the remaining tokens rarer and more valuable.

Once the pre-sale wraps up, Memereum will be available to everyone on big exchanges like PancakeSwap and our very own MemeSwap. The initial listing price will be $0.45, so early buyers get a significant advantage. On top of that, there's an airdrop campaign where you could grab some free tokens -- just a little thank-you for being part of the Memereum community early on.

One thing that makes Memereum stand out is our approach to tokenomics. It's not just about holding tokens -- it's about what you get in return. If you buy during the pre-sale, your tokens are automatically staked, which means they earn you a reward of 0.5% daily -- yep, every single day. That adds up to an impressive 183% annually, which is a great way to grow your assets passively. Plus, for every transaction that happens with Memereum, 1% of that gets distributed back to the token holders. The more tokens you have, the more you earn, making holding onto your Memereum a pretty smart move.

Growth is built into how Memereum works. The token supply is fixed, meaning we're not printing more out of thin air, and we're even burning some to keep it scarce. This, along with staking rewards and community involvement, is designed to drive up demand. As we expand with new listings, partnerships, and more insurance utilities, the value of Memereum is expected to grow even further.

So, you've read about the best crypto presales of 2024, and maybe you're feeling pumped, like you're standing at the edge of a virtual gold mine, pickaxe in hand, ready to strike it rich. Before you dive in headfirst, let's pause for a moment and acknowledge that the crypto presale world is not just a thrilling adventure, but also one that's filled with hilarious quirks and potential pitfalls.

Think of crypto presales like being invited to a secret party before the main event starts. You've got your exclusive invite, and everyone's talking about how this is the party that's going to be the next big thing -- like Woodstock, but without the mud and with a lot more digital wallets. You enter with optimism, hoping it turns into an unforgettable experience. But there's always a chance that the DJ could bail, the drinks are just tap water, and the next thing you know, you're in a room with a bunch of people scratching their heads wondering where all the magic went. Crypto presales are a lot like that -- there's an element of mystery, hope, and a little bit of risk.

And speaking of risks, remember: these presales aren't all sunshine and rainbows. It's not all about riding on a moon-bound rocket powered by AI and virtual cities (though that sounds pretty cool). Sometimes, the rocket sputters, runs out of fuel, and you end up back on the launchpad with nothing but a great story for your buddies. Buying in crypto presales is like strapping into a roller coaster blindfolded. You might be thrilled by the loops and turns, or you might be hanging on for dear life hoping it ends well. That's why the best advice is to only ride the crypto presale roller coaster with what you're okay losing -- because, let's be honest, sometimes the coaster crashes.

On the other hand, the thrill of being an early participant is pretty tempting. It's like being that person who got into Bitcoin when it was just a humble penny, or being part of that exclusive group that said ""Yes!"" to Apple stocks in a garage when people still thought Apple was just a fruit. There's something exciting about getting in on the ground floor. And with presales like EarthMeta, 5th Scape, and Mega Dice, you might just find yourself holding a winning lottery ticket -- but remember, not all tickets end up winning the jackpot. - You don't know if the chocolate bar you're about to grab is a delicious treat or if it's filled with something truly awful until you take a bite. The trick here is due diligence, and a willingness to walk out of the candy store if things don't look right.

And, of course, 2024 itself seems like it could be the year that all these presales shine. Why? Bitcoin's halving, increased adoption, and a general buzz that things are looking bullish again. It's like the stars are aligning, and every market analyst is putting on their party hats, expecting a return to the glory days. But, as always in crypto, there are no guarantees. That's part of the game -- sometimes you win big, and sometimes you're left with nothing but stories of how you ""almost made it.""

What Is Ethereum And How Does It Work?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-is-ethereum-how-does-it-work/,2024-09-29,Forbes,"Ethereum is a decentralized platform enabling the creation of decentralized applications using blockchain technology. This article explores Ethereum's purpose, operation, history and key components, providing insights into its ecosystem and future developments.

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that allows developers to build and deploy dApps and smart contracts without third-party interference. It extends the blockchain's capabilities beyond digital currency, enabling programmable agreements and applications across various industries.

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a digital currency and store of value, Ethereum introduced smart contracts -- self-executing code that automates agreements when predetermined conditions are met. Its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), powers transactions and computational services on the network, facilitating a wide range of applications from decentralized finance to NFTs. The ether spent to power transactions is known as 'gas' and is the cost of using the network.

Ethereum was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, aiming to expand blockchain's potential beyond financial transactions. Alongside co-founders Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin, Ethereum launched in 2015 after a successful crowdfunding ICO campaign. An ICO is an initial coin offering, something that is rarely seen today due to regulatory concerns. However, Ethereum pioneered the methodology leading to a spree of ICOs throughout the 2016-2017 bull run. The platform also introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine and a programming language for smart contracts, marking a significant advancement in blockchain technology.

Ethereum's inception brought about a new era of decentralized computing, enabling developers worldwide to create applications that operate without centralized control. Further, its open-source nature fostered a robust community, contributing to its rapid growth and adoption.

Today, there are several EVM-compatible chains, including BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and many others. These chains chose to build on Ethereum's achievement to create a network of blockchains capable of communicating in a similar fashion.

Ethereum is as a decentralized blockchain network which enables its smart contracts and dApps to run without downtime or censorship at the protocol level. It utilizes a distributed ledger to record transactions and state changes in smart contracts.

Developers write smart contracts using languages like Solidity, which are compiled to run on the EVM. Transactions and computations are validated by network participants (nodes) and secured through consensus mechanisms. Ether serves as the medium for compensating validators and facilitating network operations.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers securely and transparently. Each block contains a list of transactions, linked cryptographically to the previous block, forming an immutable chain.

Ethereum leverages blockchain to store and execute smart contracts, extending the technology's utility beyond simple value transfer. This enables applications in DeFi, e-commerce, supply chain management, voting systems, prediction markets, and more, ensuring that smart contracts and dApps are tamper-proof and operate as programmed.

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with terms directly written into code. They automatically execute when predefined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. Even when all permissioned users such as admins are removed the code can continue to run indefinitely with no entity able to shut them down.

On Ethereum, smart contracts are fundamental, facilitating activities like token issuance, lending and decentralized exchanges. They enable programmable, trustless agreements, revolutionizing industries by introducing new business models and streamlining processes.

Decentralized applications run on a network of computers rather than a single server, leveraging blockchain for transparency and security. dApps operate according to their smart contracts, functioning without centralized oversight.

For example, even a dApp that is banned by a government can't be shut down or have its access denied without admin rights to the code. While internet service providers may work with authorities to make it harder to access the dApp there is no way for it to be fully censored.

Ethereum has historically been the primary platform for dApp development due to its support for smart contracts and developer tools. However, other Layer 1 blockhains such as Solana, and Ethereum Layer 2 chains like Polygon, Avalanche and Base have increased in popularity due to lower fees and faster transaction times.

dApps are disrupting traditional industries by providing decentralized alternatives in finance, gaming, social media and supply chain management, enhancing user control and fostering innovation.

While both Ethereum and Bitcoin utilize blockchain technology, they serve different purposes and offer distinct features. The following sections highlight key differences and use cases to understand how these digital assets differ.

Bitcoin was designed as a digital currency and store of value, focusing on secure peer-to-peer transactions. Ethereum, however, is a programmable platform that is Turing complete, extending its capabilities beyond transactions.

Ethereum's block time is shorter, allowing faster transaction confirmations. It also now employs a different consensus mechanism and has a flexible monetary policy compared to Bitcoin's fixed supply.

However, Ethereum originally launched with a similar Proof-of-work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, allowing network participants to mine ether using graphics cards. The protocol has since migrated to a more energy efficient proof-of-stake system.

Bitcoin is commonly used for censorship resistant peer-to-peer transactions and as a hedge against inflation. Its primary use cases involve payments, remittances and investment.

Ethereum supports a vast ecosystem of applications, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces and decentralized autonomous organizations. Its versatility allows developers to create innovative solutions across various industries. Many view Ethereum as digital oil compared to Bitcoin's digital gold narrative.

Additionally, Ethereum allows for tokenization of data meaning that both digital and real world assets can be represented by on-chain tokens for value transfer. Essentially, Bitcoin is a simple but elegant globally distributed monetary system while Ethereum is a decentralized computer with the ability to digitize value in many forms.

Ethereum's ecosystem encompasses components that facilitate its functionality and growth. Key elements like the Ethereum Virtual Machine and other recent upgrades contribute to its adaptability and scalability.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum. It acts as the decentralized computer executing scripts across the network. The EVM enables developers to run code of arbitrary complexity, ensuring consistent behavior across the network.

By providing a secure environment, the EVM ensures smart contracts do not interfere with each other. It supports multiple programming languages and is integral to Ethereum's ability to support complex decentralized systems.

Ethereum 2.0 was an upgrade aimed at improving scalability, security and sustainability. It introduced a shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus and shard chains to increase transaction throughput.

The upgrade enhanced the network's capacity, reducing congestion and fees. Transitioning to proof-of-stake lowered energy consumption and promoted a decentralized validator ecosystem. Eth2 included a series of upgrades transforming the network's infrastructure.

The upgrade, along with an additional change causing a percentage of gas to be burnt with each transaction led to Ethereum becoming deflationary. Since The Merge the total supply of ether has decreased by 160,923 ETH, around $418 million. This reduction created an inflation rate of -0.066%.

Had Ethereum kept its proof-of-work mechanism the supply would have grown by 7,903,486 ETH, equivalent to around $20.5 billion and an inflation rate of 3.2%.

Consensus mechanisms are crucial for blockchain security and operation. Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake marked a significant evolution in how the network reached agreement on transactions.

Proof-of-work requires miners to solve complex puzzles to add new blocks, consuming substantial energy. Bitcoin and the original Ethereum network used PoW.

Proof-of-stake replaces miners with validators who stake ether to participate in block validation. Validators are chosen based on the amount they stake, reducing energy consumption and aligning economic incentives with network security.

Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022 through a process known as The Merge, combining the original Mainnet with the Beacon Chain. This eliminated energy-intensive mining, reducing energy consumption by approximately 99%.

The transition improved network security and sustainability while maintaining Ethereum's core functionalities. It set the stage for future scalability upgrades within its roadmap like sharding.

Ethereum wallets allow users to interact with the network, manage ether and tokens, and access dApps. Wallets include hardware wallets like Ledger, software wallets like MetaMask, web wallets and mobile wallets.

When choosing a wallet, consider security features, ease of use, dApp compatibility, NFTs, and support for multiple tokens. Hardware wallets offer enhanced security by storing private keys offline, while software wallets provide convenience but may be more vulnerable to cyber threats.

Users should also decide between custodial wallets, where a third party holds private keys, or non-custodial wallets, providing full control over funds. Balancing security with accessibility is key.

Ethereum faces challenges such as scalability issues, where high network usage leads to congestion and increased fees. While upgrades aim to address this, full implementation is ongoing.

Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose risks, as flawed code can be exploited, leading to financial losses. Regulatory uncertainties also may impact adoption and operation in various jurisdictions.

Competition from other blockchain platforms offering similar capabilities presents a challenge, potentially drawing users and developers away from Ethereum. Most recently, Layer 2 blockchains like Base have started to gain considerable traction. As a result, the number of daily transactions on Ethereum mainnet have stagnated. This has led to Ethereum's supply to increase as less gas is burnt, causing it to become slightly inflationary once again.

Ethereum's future involves upgrades to improve scalability and usability. Post-merge developments focus on implementing shard chains, increasing transaction throughput and efficiency.

Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimistic Rollups reduce congestion by processing transactions off-chain. These enhancements aim to support a growing ecosystem of dApps.

Continued innovation in DeFi, NFTs, AI and new applications will likely expand Ethereum's influence. Its adaptability and active community position it as a leading force in blockchain technology.

Further, Ethereum's development roadmap extends beyond The Merge, outlining five key phases aimed at enhancing the network's capabilities.

As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has described, these stages include The Surge, focusing on scalability improvements through sharding and layer 2 solutions; The Scourge, addressing decentralization concerns and economic centralization risks; The Verge, aimed at simplifying block verification and improving data storage efficiency; The Purge, designed to reduce computational costs for node operators; and The Splurge, encompassing various smaller upgrades to ""fix everything else.""

These phases are part of a long-term vision to create a more scalable, secure and sustainable blockchain ecosystem. While the exact implementation timeline remains fluid, each stage represents a critical step in Ethereum's evolution, potentially reshaping the network's performance and utility in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

Ethereum is a versatile platform extending beyond digital currency to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its evolution to Proof-of-stake is seen by many as progress toward scalability, security and sustainability.

Ethereum continues to develop through upgrades and innovations and it remains foundational in driving advancements in DeFi, digital assets and blockchain applications. However, the increase of EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchains have reduced mainnet activity. Further, competition from chains like Solana raise questions as to whether it will be able to retain its dominant position in the longer term.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f508976bb31223eca58524/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,0.2784313725490195
"Rise of the ""crypto voter"": The surprising group that could swing the election",https://www.salon.com/2024/09/28/rise-of-the-crypto-voter-the-surprising-group-that-could-swing-the/,2024-09-28,Salon.com,"The crypto world hit a major milestone earlier this year with the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a clear sign that digital assets are gaining traction on Wall Street and Main Street alike. As traditional financial institutions come around, more Americans are eyeing cryptocurrencies as a serious investment option, signaling a shift in the financial landscape that could impact the presidential race.

""It has been clear throughout this election cycle in the United States that cryptocurrency is a bigger priority for both parties than it has been in the past, which is exciting to see from an industry growth perspective,"" says Hany Rashwan, co-founder and CEO of 21Shares, one of the biggest issuers of the cryptocurrency exchange-traded products globally.

Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris made her first public comments on crypto earlier this month, telling donors in New York that her administration would ""invest in America's future"" by supporting digital assets and other technologies while ensuring consumer protections, according to Bloomberg. Harris' remarks signal that Democrats, like Republicans, are beginning to embrace the crypto industry.

While both presidential campaigns are stepping up their efforts to win over crypto voters, there is still a long road ahead to craft comprehensive Web3 policy that would make the U.S. competitive in the world, according to industry analysts who are closely watching the race.

""We have seen Harris and Trump both trying to use crypto and befriend crypto. It looks like they want to tap into the community,"" says Art Malkov, a New York-based advisor at Columbia University's Lab to Market Blockchain accelerator and co-founder of the Web3Lab accelerator. Malkov noted that the crypto market has reached a critical mass of adoption and development that it can no longer be ignored by mainstream politicians.

""We got the election speeding up the process where now Harris cannot afford not embrace crypto because Trump is embracing it,"" he says.

This may prove to be a landmark year in the history of crypto development and mainstream adoption. In a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Sept. 24, Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the committee, said she wants to ""strike a grand bargain on stablecoins"" before the end of the year, as reported by The Block. This follows two years of bipartisan negotiations on a bill to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins -- which are typically pegged to another currency or reserve -- and could signal potential progress in crypto regulation as the year comes to a close.

Morningstar's Bryan Armour says it has already been a ""pivotal year"" for crypto adoption by US investors. He notes IShares Bitcoin Trust became the fastest exchange-traded fund (ETF) to reach $10 billion in assets under management, and spot bitcoin ETFs already reached a total of $50 billion in net assets as of Sept. 10.

""It's remarkable to think of an industry that is about 15 years old and now it's a part of one of our leading parties' platforms,"" says Patrick Kirby, policy counsel at Crypto Council for Innovation, noting that crypto has become a legitimate campaign issue for the first time in American presidential history. ""It's important to remind ourselves, as an industry and for folks interested in this space, just how far we've come.""

Together with traditional institutions that have warmed up to crypto this year, about 40% of American adults now own crypto, a jump from 30% in 2023, according to recent data compiled by Security.org. Bitcoin ETF approval has certainly been a big boost in confidence, with 21% of non-owners saying they're more likely to invest in cryptocurrency now given the exchange-traded fund wrapper.

In a major milestone for the crypto world, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of several Bitcoin ETFs in January, allowing shares in trusts holding Bitcoin to be traded on SEC-regulated exchanges.

Then in May, the SEC unexpectedly approved proposals for the first spot Ethereum ETFs. Spot Ethereum ETFs will directly hold Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, allowing investors to own a share of the cryptocurrency through grantor trusts.

In addition to milestone crypto products getting approvals, lawmakers came together in May to pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which proposes a regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States.

It's an important milestone as the bill aims to provide clarity for the digital asset industry while mandating cooperation between regulatory agencies to avoid duplicate regulations. It assigns oversight responsibilities to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for assets on decentralized blockchains and to the SEC for those on non-decentralized blockchains, with specific criteria for each category.

Still, there is plenty of uncertainty about the next steps and the future of this bill. It's not just the top of the ticket and federal regulation that will matter in the November election, the makeup of Congress and relevant committees will play a crucial role in shaping America's crypto policy in months to come.

Increasingly, lawmakers are looking to address this growing interest and demand for crypto products at the state level as well.

State legislatures have been actively engaging with digital asset regulation, as evidenced by the introduction of more than 165 bills this year in current legislative sessions, according to data compiled by Crypto Council for Innovation. These proposed laws cover a wide range of topics within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, addressing issues such as stablecoin standards and cryptocurrency mining.

Notably, about 70% of these bills have either successfully passed or remain under active consideration, indicating a strong momentum in state-level efforts to establish regulatory frameworks for digital assets.

State governments are actively shaping crypto policy through new laws and regulations, according to a report by Crypto Council for Innovation.

""Crypto swing states could emerge given the close nature of many of the races,"" Liz Mills of Crypto Council for Innovation wrote in a report. ""Crypto voters want politicians to set clear rules for cryptocurrency, providing investors with choices and allowing the sector to continue to grow and create jobs.""

Republicans have been especially proactive in recognizing digital currencies markets as an important issue, as recent polling shows crypto becoming a significant issue for many voters. Among Republicans not initially planning to vote for former President Donald Trump, 13% said his support for crypto increased their likelihood of voting for him. Additionally, 38% of non-white Republican supporters reported feeling more excited to vote for Trump due to his pro-crypto stance.

Trump is aggressively courting crypto-friendly voters ahead of the 2024 election, releasing a new batch of NFT trading cards in August and promoting a cryptocurrency project run by his sons.

This marks a significant reversal from his previous skepticism of cryptocurrencies, with Trump now dubbing himself the ""crypto president.""

In a speech at a bitcoin conference in July, Trump pledged that, if elected, his administration would retain all bitcoin held by the U.S. government, as reported by Axios. This sentiment aligns with the ""hodl"" mentality popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

""For too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart, never sell your bitcoin,"" Trump said at the event.

Trump also promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office, a statement that received enthusiastic applause from the audience.

In the absence of a comprehensive crypto policy plan, Trump's agenda is a compilation of promises and crypto ventures that seem poised to benefit the Trump family. His latest DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, aims to promote U.S. dollar dominance through widespread adoption of dollar-pegged stablecoins in decentralized finance, according to CoinTelegraph.

The venture has hinted at a partnership with Aave, which is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Trump's latest project positions itself as a way to maintain America's financial leadership globally, though details remain scarce and the project has already been targeted by scammers and hackers.

Notably, there are some questions about whether the new venture is more grift than digital innovation. A white paper obtained by CoinDesk earlier this month showed World Liberty Financial's ownership structure relies on a ""governance"" token, with 70% allocated to insiders like Trump and his sons -- a proportion described as ""significantly higher-than-normal"" for such ventures.

Still, crypto enthusiasts and advocates - from crypto billionaires, CEOs and the Winklevoss twins - are backing Trump and see his presidency as favorable to the industry's continued development. Kraken co-founder and CEO Jesse Powell is one of the corporate leaders who has publicly supported Trump's crypto venture by donating $1 million in Ethereum to the former president, describing him as the ""only pro-crypto major party candidate"" in a post on X.

According to Fortune's reporting, Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas confirmed that Future Forward, Kamala Harris's official super PAC, has onboarded with Coinbase Commerce to accept cryptocurrency donations.

This move by Kamala Harris's super PAC to accept cryptocurrency donations via Coinbase Commerce marks a significant departure from the Biden administration's generally cautious stance on crypto, potentially signaling a shift in Democratic policy.

""She has not rolled out the details yet, but she has made overtures that she would like to drive crypto legislation,"" Haas said, noting she was ""cautiously optimistic.""

While the Harris campaign published more of its policy priorities ahead of the presidential debate on Sept. 10, few details were disclosed when it comes to crypto policy. The Harris campaign declined to elaborate further.

Harris on Wednesday vowed to invest in the industry so that the United States would ""remain dominant"" in the blockchain space.

There are still plenty of market risks associated with cryptocurrencies, outside of regulatory clarity and framework.

As the latest milestones have been encouraging to crypto advocates, the U.S. still has a lot of catching up to do compared to other advanced economies when it comes to formulating its digital asset policy.

""The US has a less mature regulatory framework in place for cryptocurrency than other countries, particularly those in Europe where there is greater clarity around crypto regulations and buy-in from politicians,"" says Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21Shares, which has been operating in Europe for the last seven years.

Cryptocurrencies' recent poor performance, volatility and a flat debut for spot ethereum ETFs are also stalling adoption, according to Morningstar's Bryan Armour.

""Unfortunately, we're seeing the US lag behind: We saw the European Union, Singapore, Hong Kong, the U.K. put different regulatory frameworks in place,"" says Kirby of Crypto Council for Innovation. ""We're seeing momentum on the US side, but no comprehensive market structure bill has become law yet and there's still an opportunity to catch up.""",https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/09/kamala_harris_donald_trump_cryptocurrency_bitcoin_ethereum_1244771640_2174475877_2173601204.jpg,0.5294117647058822

Ethereum Network: A Comprehensive Overview | ABC Money,https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/2024/09/ethereum-network-a-comprehensive-overview/,2024-09-27,ABC Money,"Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is one of the most significant and widely used blockchain networks in the world. It extends the capabilities of Bitcoin by offering more than just a decentralized payment system. With its innovative smart contract functionality, Ethereum has become the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This article provides an in-depth look at the Ethereum network, its structure, use cases, benefits, challenges, and its future.

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed primarily as a digital currency, Ethereum was created to be a ""world computer"" capable of running decentralized applications without downtime, fraud, or interference from third parties. The native cryptocurrency of Ethereum is Ether (ETH), which powers the network by being used to pay transaction fees (gas fees) and incentivize participants (miners/validators).

As of 2023, Ethereum's market capitalization stands at over $200 billion, making it the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. The network has paved the way for various sectors such as finance, gaming, and art, introducing decentralized solutions to traditionally centralized industries.

Ethereum is built on several key components that work together to form its decentralized architecture:

These elements allow Ethereum to go beyond a simple cryptocurrency system, supporting a wide range of decentralized applications and services.

While Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized digital currency, Ethereum was designed to be much more versatile. Key differences include:

One of the most transformative applications of Ethereum has been in the world of decentralized finance. DeFi platforms enable users to borrow, lend, and trade cryptocurrencies without relying on traditional financial intermediaries like banks. For example, platforms like Aave and Uniswap run on Ethereum and allow users to access financial services without third-party involvement.

In 2021, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols surpassed $100 billion, with Ethereum being the primary platform hosting these applications.

Ethereum is the leading blockchain for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets representing ownership of items like art, music, and virtual real estate. Marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible use Ethereum to allow creators to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. In 2021, the NFT market on Ethereum alone reached a trading volume of over $10 billion.

Ethereum has become the go-to platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). From gaming (e.g., Axie Infinity) to social networks and supply chain management, dApps are built on Ethereum's robust infrastructure. Smart contracts are at the core of these applications, automating complex processes without the need for intermediaries.

Ethereum 2.0 is a series of upgrades designed to improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of the Ethereum network. One of the key changes is the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), which will drastically reduce the network's energy consumption by eliminating mining.

In addition to PoS, Ethereum 2.0 introduces sharding, a mechanism to split the network into smaller pieces (shards) to increase the transaction throughput. With Ethereum 2.0 fully implemented, the network is expected to process thousands of transactions per second, resolving many of the current scalability issues.

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It is powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).

While Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain that supports smart contracts and dApps, making it more versatile for various applications.

Gas fees are transaction fees paid in Ether (ETH) to execute operations on the Ethereum network. These fees compensate the miners or validators who process and secure transactions.

Ethereum 2.0 is an upgrade to the Ethereum network that will improve scalability and energy efficiency by transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS) and implementing sharding.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and automatically enforce the contract's conditions.

Decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that run on blockchain networks like Ethereum, without relying on centralized servers or intermediaries.

Ethereum is the leading platform for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unique digital assets that represent ownership of items like art and collectibles.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading that are conducted on decentralized platforms like Ethereum without traditional intermediaries.

Staking on Ethereum 2.0 involves locking up a certain amount of Ether (ETH) to participate in securing the network and validating transactions, earning rewards in return.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,651.51.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 147% and ETH is up 63% year over year.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1764705882352942

The world of online gambling is rapidly evolving, and crypto casinos are at the forefront of this revolution. In Poland, these innovative platforms are gaining traction among tech-savvy gamblers seeking new and exciting ways to enjoy their favorite games.

Crypto casinos offer a unique blend of traditional gambling experiences with the cutting-edge technology of cryptocurrencies, providing Polish players with enhanced privacy, faster transactions, and often more favorable odds.

As digital currencies continue to reshape the financial landscape, their integration into the online gambling sector has opened up new possibilities for Polish players. This guide aims to explore the ins and outs of crypto gambling in Poland, helping you navigate this exciting yet complex world with confidence.

Understanding Crypto Casinos

Crypto casinos are online gambling platforms that accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. These digital casinos operate on blockchain technology, allowing players to wager using various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin.

The key distinction between crypto casinos and traditional online casinos lies in the payment methods and the underlying technology that powers them.

In Poland, crypto casinos have emerged as an alternative to conventional online gambling sites, offering a range of benefits that appeal to many players.

These platforms often provide faster transactions, enhanced privacy, and in some cases, more favorable odds due to lower operational costs.

One of the main advantages of using cryptocurrencies for gambling in Poland is the level of anonymity it provides. While traditional online casinos require extensive personal information, crypto casinos often need minimal details, allowing players to maintain a higher degree of privacy.

Additionally, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means that transactions are not subject to the same level of scrutiny or potential interference from financial institutions or government bodies.

Legal Status of Crypto Casinos in Poland

The legal landscape for crypto casinos in Poland is complex and evolving. Polish gambling laws do not specifically address cryptocurrency gambling.

The primary legislation governing online gambling in Poland is the Gambling Act of 2009, which has been amended several times but still lacks clear provisions for crypto casinos.

Currently, online gambling in Poland is heavily regulated, with the state-owned Totalizator Sportowy holding a monopoly on most forms of online gambling.

Foreign operators are required to obtain a license from the Polish Ministry of Finance to offer their services legally to Polish players. However, the licensing process for traditional online casinos does not explicitly cover crypto gambling operations.

This legal gray area has led to a situation where many international crypto casinos continue to accept Polish players, operating in a somewhat ambiguous legal environment.

It's important to note that while playing at these casinos may not be explicitly illegal for Polish residents, the lack of clear regulations means that players do so at their own risk.

Polish authorities have been known to block access to unlicensed gambling websites, including some crypto casinos. However, the effectiveness of these measures is limited, as many players use VPNs to access blocked sites.

How We Selected the Best Casinos for Poland

In compiling our recommendations for the best crypto casinos available to Polish players, we considered several crucial factors.

Our selection process involved thorough research and analysis of numerous platforms, taking into account user reviews, expert opinions, and our own testing.

We prioritized casinos that demonstrate a commitment to fair play and transparency, particularly those utilizing provably fair algorithms.

Security was another key consideration, with preference given to platforms employing robust encryption and multi-factor authentication.

Additionally, we looked at the range of games offered, the quality of the user interface, and the responsiveness of customer support.

Casinos with a track record of prompt payouts and favorable exchange rates for cryptocurrency transactions were also ranked higher in our assessment.

Importantly, we considered the legal aspects, focusing on platforms that, while not necessarily licensed in Poland, have a strong reputation for responsible operations and adherence to international gambling standards.

Features to Look for in a Crypto Casino

When choosing a crypto casino in Poland, consider the following features:

Popular Cryptocurrencies Accepted by Polish Casinos

Common cryptocurrencies accepted at casinos catering to Polish players include:

Embarking on your crypto gambling journey in Poland requires some preparation. The first step is setting up a cryptocurrency wallet.

This digital wallet will store your cryptocurrencies and allow you to make transactions. There are various types of wallets available, including software wallets (desktop or mobile apps), hardware wallets (physical devices for extra security), and web wallets (accessed through a browser).

Once you've chosen and set up your wallet, the next step is acquiring cryptocurrencies. In Poland, you can purchase cryptocurrencies through various methods.

Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or local Polish exchanges such as BitBay offer straightforward ways to buy crypto using Polish Złoty or other fiat currencies. Some exchanges may require identity verification to comply with anti-money laundering regulations.

After obtaining your cryptocurrencies, you're ready to make deposits at your chosen crypto casino. The process is typically straightforward: navigate to the casino's deposit page, select your preferred cryptocurrency, and follow the instructions to transfer funds from your wallet to the casino's address.

Always double-check the address to avoid sending funds to the wrong destination.

Withdrawals follow a similar process in reverse. Request a withdrawal from the casino, provide your wallet address, and wait for the transaction to be processed.

Crypto transactions are generally much faster than traditional banking methods, with most withdrawals completed within minutes or hours rather than days.

It's crucial to familiarize yourself with the basics of cryptocurrency transactions, including understanding blockchain confirmations and transaction fees.

While crypto transactions are typically faster than traditional methods, the time can vary depending on network congestion and the specific cryptocurrency used.

Responsible Gambling in Crypto Casinos

While crypto gambling can be entertaining, it's crucial to approach it responsibly. Many reputable crypto casinos serving Polish players offer tools to promote responsible gambling.

These often include options to set deposit limits, loss limits, and session time limits. By utilizing these features, you can maintain control over your gambling habits and prevent potential problems.

Self-exclusion options are another important feature offered by responsible crypto casinos. These allow players to voluntarily ban themselves from the platform for a specified period or indefinitely if they feel their gambling is becoming problematic.

For Polish players struggling with gambling addiction, several resources are available. The Polish Gambling Addiction Treatment Center (Ośrodek Terapii Uzależnienia od Hazardu) provides support and treatment options.

Additionally, international organizations like Gamblers Anonymous often have online resources and support groups that can be accessed from Poland.

Disadvantages:

Conclusion

The crypto casino landscape in Poland is evolving rapidly, offering players an exciting array of options that combine the best of traditional online gambling with the innovations of blockchain technology.

From established international platforms to emerging local favorites, Polish crypto enthusiasts have access to a diverse selection of gaming sites that cater to various preferences and playing styles.

As the regulatory environment continues to develop and more players discover the benefits of crypto gambling, we can expect to see further growth and innovation in this sector.

Whether you're a seasoned crypto gambler or new to the scene, the casinos featured in this guide provide excellent starting points for your Polish crypto gaming adventure.

The legal status of crypto casinos in Poland is complex. While online gambling is regulated, there are no specific laws addressing crypto gambling. Many international crypto casinos accept Polish players, operating in a gray area. It's advisable to stay informed about current regulations and choose reputable platforms that prioritize player protection.

What cryptocurrencies can I use at Polish crypto casinos?

Most crypto casinos accepting Polish players support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Some platforms also accept lesser-known altcoins. The exact selection varies by casino, so check each site's banking options for specific details.

How do I deposit and withdraw funds at a crypto casino?

To deposit, you'll typically need to send cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the casino's designated address. For withdrawals, you request a payout to your wallet address. The process is usually straightforward and faster than traditional banking methods, often completing within minutes to a few hours.

Are crypto casinos safe for Polish players?

Reputable crypto casinos employ strong security measures, including encryption and provably fair gaming. However, it's crucial to choose licensed and well-reviewed platforms. Always practice responsible gambling and be wary of potential scams.

Can I play in Polish złoty (PLN) at crypto casinos?

While most crypto casinos operate primarily in cryptocurrencies, some offer the option to display balances and wager in PLN. However, transactions are typically processed in crypto, with automatic conversion applied.

What games are available at crypto casinos for Polish players?

Crypto casinos often offer a wide range of games, including slots, table games like blackjack and roulette, live dealer games, and sometimes sports betting. Many also feature provably fair games specifically designed for blockchain technology.

Do I need to verify my identity to play at a crypto casino?

Identity verification requirements vary. Some crypto casinos offer anonymous play for low-stakes gaming, while others require KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, especially for larger transactions or withdrawals. Always check the casino's terms and conditions.

Are there bonuses available for Polish players at crypto casinos?

Yes, many crypto casinos offer generous bonuses to Polish players, including welcome packages, deposit matches, free spins, and loyalty programs. Be sure to read the terms and conditions, as wagering requirements and other restrictions may apply.

How does the volatility of cryptocurrencies affect my gambling?

Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate significantly, which may impact your gambling funds. Some casinos offer options to lock in exchange rates or play in stablecoins to mitigate this risk. Consider your risk tolerance when choosing which cryptocurrency to use for gambling.

Can I access customer support in Polish at crypto casinos?

While not all crypto casinos offer Polish-language support, many international platforms provide multi-lingual assistance. Check if Polish support is available before signing up if this is important to you. Some casinos may offer translation services or English support as alternatives.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best-bitcoin-casino-poland.jpg,0.3725490196078431

Throughout the period, Coinsilium continued to make solid operational progress across its investment and advisory activities, and we are pleased to provide details of developments and significant news released to the market during the reporting period:

Investment Portfolio Update

Indorse and Byzant Web3 Ecosystem

On 29 January 2024, the Company provided an update regarding its investee, Web3 development company Indorse Pte. Ltd. (""Indorse""), and the ongoing collaboration with Indorse on the 'Byzant Web3 Social Network Ecosystem' (""the Collaboration""). The primary focus of this collaboration has been on the development of a range of Web3 applications. One such application, the Bastion Wallet was launched in August 2023 and enables both seasoned crypto users and newcomers to seamlessly interact with Web3 applications.

Additionally, Indorse's technical team has been working closely with A-ADS one of the longest-established and largest crypto and Bitcoin advertising networks, to develop Adbazaar, a decentralised advertising platform tailored for Web3 advertisers and publishers.

The involvement of A-ADS, whose core team brings 13 years of experience in crypto-based advertising, alongside Coinsilium and Indorse, reinforces the depth of expertise driving the development of the Byzant Web3 Ecosystem.

Web3 advertising presents a highly promising but still underdeveloped opportunity compared to its well-established role as a revenue driver in Web2 social media. Coinsilium views early movers in the Web3 advertising space, such as Adbazaar, as being well-positioned to capitalise on this emerging market. While Adbazaar is still in its development phase, the project holds significant potential to leverage early entry into the Web3 advertising landscape. Backed by industry veterans like A-ADS, the project aims to position itself as a competitive player, ready to capitalise on the nascent revenue opportunities in this sector.

Throughout the period, Adbazaar has been the primary focus for the Collaboration, due to its clearer path toward commercialisation and potential to generate early revenues. As the project gains traction in the Web3 advertising market, it will provide a solid foundation for developing the additional applications within the Byzant ecosystem. This approach allows us to focus on more immediate opportunities, while the broader range of applications will be prioritised once Adbazaar is fully refined and ready for launch.

Managing these steps carefully is essential for ensuring long-term scalability and success. The latest version of the Adbazaar platform is currently being tested by A-ADS, marking a key milestone in this strategy.

Greengage

Coinsilium holds an equity investment in Greengage Global Holding Limited (""Greengage""). Greengage's core business activity centres on providing distributed e-money account services through partnerships with regulated payments-as-a-service firms, tailored to entrepreneurs, SMEs, family offices, and digital asset firms. Greengage offers its clients personal and business e-money accounts in over 50 currencies, including GBP, EUR, and USD. Clients benefit from 24/7 account access and a dedicated relationship manager for personalised support. The services include faster payments, CHAPS, and SEPA payment services, with access to SWIFT payments and Foreign Exchange (FX) depending on the chosen regulated partner provider.

Greengage also provides value-added services through a network of third-party providers. One such service is B2B loans, with the platform facilitating over a quarter of a billion USD in lending since its inception. An example of an innovative product is lending in fiat against tradable cryptocurrencies on a non-recourse basis to provide growth capital, alongside other unique financial solutions.

During the period Greengage notified Coinsilium that it has signed an agreement with a new regulated partner to bring forward the launch of its USD currency accounts (as well as several other currencies including CHF, SEK and CAD) along with FX and SWIFT payments for its clients.

This is significant news as there still remain very few ""crypto friendly"" payment providers offering USD accounts. Greengage management expect that this new agreement will both help to attract new clients for their services as well as strengthen their existing client relationships. Greengage also advised that they continue to maintain a healthy pipeline for new account opening submissions.

Post Period Developments

On 5 July 2024 Greengage announced news of a new collaboration with global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to originate SME debt on the Coinbase Diamond Protocol.

Coindash

Coindash's main product is the SSV Network. Ssv.network is a fully decentralized, open-source ETH staking network, based on Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology. Ethereum validators are required to stake 32 ETH and operate a software validator client alongside legacy and Beacon Chain nodes. This process introduces complexity, especially as the creation of a validator results in a crucial Validator Key responsible for transaction signing. SSV Network addresses this complexity, enhancing validator key security, and delivering benefits to the broader Ethereum network, staking pools, services, and individual stakers.

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -2-

There are currently 11,233,472 SSV tokens in circulation.

As of 16 August 2024, these were the SSV Network metrics:

. 878 Operators

. 41,642 Validators

. 1,332,544 Staked ETH

. USD3.495Bn TVL (Total Valued Locked)

Revaluation of Coindash Interest

As of 31 December 2023, the price of the SSV token stood at USD6.83 per token. By 30 June 2024 at the end of the reporting period, the token price had increased to USD36.09, with a peak of USD61.30 per token recorded on 26 March 2024 with a fully diluted market capitalization for the total supply of SSV tokens at USUSD713.4 million.

Given the substantial SSV token holdings in Coindash's cryptocurrency treasury and the significant price appreciation of SSV tokens throughout the reporting period, the Company has determined to revalue its interest in Coindash. This decision is grounded in the material increase in the value of Coindash's liquid SSV holdings, and the revaluation is applied pro-rata to the Company's stake in Coindash.

While the price of the SSV token experienced a significant increase of 528% over the reporting period, the Company's revalued its stake in Coindash by 346%, adjusted to reflect the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) performance of the SSV token. This adjustment takes into account the fluctuations in SSV tokens market liquidity and its overall trading volume during the period.

Silta Finance

Coinsilium holds a convertible loan and option interest in Silta. During the period, Silta notified Coinsilium that it had received an investment from a top 10 global infrastructure development bank (""Bank"") as part of a strategic partnership agreement to build a climate financing marketplace, powered by AI, for bankability and sustainability assessments. This strategic partnership aims to help support governments, infrastructure developers, and financial institutions to reach their goals of deploying USUSD800B towards Climate Financing by 2030.

Post Period Events

Strategic Web3 Collaboration with Liteflow

On 2 July 2024 Coinsilium announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MoU"") with Liteflow, Inc (""Liteflow""), an experienced Web3 and NFT technical developer. The MoU is the first step in a planned long-term strategic collaboration between Coinsilium and Liteflow, which aims to provide financial backing, comprehensive advisory services, and cutting-edge technological resources to help budding companies navigate the complexities of the Web3 landscape and maximize their chances of long-term business success.

SAFT to acquire Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol Tokens

On 3 July 2024 Consilium announced that it had entered into a SAFT with the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol. Otomato is designed to simplify interactions with DeFi platforms through automation and user-friendly interfaces. It can help bridge the gap for DeFi traders without coding skills by automating complex tasks and providing clear, intuitive guides.

Otomato.xyz is the first decentralised application of the Protocol and enables De-Fi traders to create and automate their own Web3 trading strategies as a succession of on-chain actions which can integrate reactions to off-chain events. User control and security on the platform are ensured through account abstraction (ERC-4337), making blockchain automation accessible and efficient for all users.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD75,000 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Early Backers' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. Coinsilium also has the option to acquire an additional USD150,150 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Strategic' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. In addition, Coinsilium will earn 7.5% of revenues generated by the Otomato.xyz platform up to the time of the Token Listing Event, anticipated to occur during 2025.

Revenues will be predominantly derived from affiliate fees from actions executed through integrated protocols and fees from transactions initiated via the Otomato.xyz platform. The public launch of the platform is expected by Q4 2024, when revenues would be expected to commence.

Elevate Health

Elevate Health has progressed in its transformation into a decentralised science (DeSci) project, focusing on creating a platform that rewards members for contributing and accessing data, research, and treatments in preventative healthcare.

The project is currently in discussions with a prominent, yet undisclosed, decentralised launchpad, which has raised approximately USD1 billion for various token projects over the past three years. It is noteworthy that DeSci-related tokens have shown strong post-launch performance compared to other sectors.

Elevate Health has advised Coinsilium that it is targeting a potential token issuance by the end of 2024. Further updates will be provided to the market as and when available.

Arcadian Youth Pte Ltd (formerly ""StartupToken"")

StartupToken has successfully transitioned its business model to focus on Web3 Real World Asset (""RWA"") tokenization, with an initial emphasis on the Bali real estate market.

The company's flagship application, Propex, is now in the advanced stages of development. Propex is designed to streamline the transaction of real estate assets by bringing ownership transfers onto the blockchain. This aims to automate and simplify the process for property owners and their counterparties by tokenizing property contracts into unique, programmable assets (NFTs). These NFTs can be used for various Web3 applications, such as trading, collateralized loans, and more. Propex offers real estate agents and notaries a minting service to create on-chain proof of ownership, while maintaining the existing system of record. The blockchain-based records serve as tamper-proof, verified copies that co-exist with the traditional system until full adoption of on-chain processes. While the initial market focus is on Bali, Indonesia, the Propex solution has potential applications in other regions beyond this initial market.

The Arcadian Youth team recently updated the Company, reporting that the first development stage of the blockchain-based application has been completed. In this initial phase, the application allows users to mint 'location NFTs,' enabling them to participate in challenges and earn points. The second stage will introduce the ability for property owners to mint their real estate NFTs, with notary verification, unlocking access to decentralised finance (DeFi) and RWA exchange platforms.

Additionally, the team informed us that their application for a grant from Lisk, a Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum and part of the Optimism Superchain, was successful. Lisk is focused on providing solutions for emerging markets through the tokenization of RWAs, which aligns well with Propex's goals.

We will continue to update the market with news and developments regarding Propex as the project progresses.

Outlook

Bitcoin's sharp rise throughout the period in review, culminating in a new all-time high prior to the May 'halving' event, diverged from historic cycles, where such peaks are usually observed after the halving.

This early surge fuelled a degree of overexuberance, which in turn contributed to significant price fluctuations and heightened volatility post period to date, albeit that Bitcoin is now trading at significantly higher price levels than it was during the reporting period.

The recent volatility in the market has ultimately strengthened Bitcoin's position in the hands of longer-term holders, setting the stage for a more resilient recovery, which we are now beginning to witness.

The recent 50 basis point interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in four years, combined with the expectation of increased market liquidity, bolsters our confidence that a recovery in the crypto markets is well underway. We anticipate this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, with 2025 expected to bring even greater strength to the market which in turn should create a more favourable environment for investment and growth across the broader sector.

Coinsilium's efforts over the past two years, to strategically position itself for this anticipated positive market phase, are now starting to bear fruit. During this period, we have focused on expanding and scaling our advisory services capabilities, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the expected bull market in the Web3 sector. Our structured approach not only drives forward key strategic initiatives but also lays a strong foundation for both short and medium-term value generation. Most importantly, these efforts set the stage for sustained long-term growth as we continue to leverage our expertise and strategic positioning in this rapidly evolving market.

Anticipated Yellow Token Launch and Listing in Q4 2024

(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires

September 27, 2024 06:51 ET (10:51 GMT)

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -4-

A key catalyst for Coinsilium, expected in Q4 2024, is the upcoming token launch and listing of the Yellow token. As announced 21 April 2022, Coinsilium entered into a USUSD200,000 Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) in Yellow. Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens in this early funding round, vesting over a period of time. The token launch will mark an important liquidity event for the Company, signalling the fruition of a long-term strategic investment.

Yellow Network recently announced that it had secured USD10 million in funding, led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This strategic investment comes as Yellow's market valuation reportedly reaches over USUSD200m, positioning Yellow as a frontrunner in the DeFi trading revolution. Other notable backers and supporters include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. This funding round also highlights the growing confidence in Yellow Network's potential to address key inefficiencies in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, such as liquidity fragmentation and scalability.

With the launch of the Yellow token, Coinsilium will stand to benefit not only from a significant liquidity event but also from the enhanced visibility and market traction Yellow is expected to gain as a result of this strong backing. The involvement of high-profile investors like Chris Larsen further strengthens the case for Yellow's long-term success, which aligns well with Coinsilium's strategic vision.

Investors are encouraged to monitor this event closely, as it not only validates Coinsilium's early-stage investment strategy but also presents a promising opportunity for growth and value realisation.

Yellow is a highly ambitious project, aiming to address key inefficiencies in the DeFi space. Should Yellow meet its objectives, it has the potential to become a key player in the decentralised clearing space, backed by strong investment, experienced partners, and a clear vision.

Strategic Partnership with Liteflow Driving Web3 Innovation

Following the announcement of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liteflow on 2nd July 2024, we are pleased to report that this strategic collaboration is already showing significant promise. The initiative, which offers USUSD1 million in dedicated seed funding for early-stage Web3 startups, has attracted strong interest from high-quality applicants within DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi sectors. The creation of an Investment Committee as part of the process, composed of both companies and certain pre-approved co-investors, further strengthens this initiative, by ensuring a rigorous procedure for the assessment and selection of projects.

The initiative also integrates Coinsilium's advisory services as a key part of the same offering. This means that, in addition to investment opportunities, we are able to provide fee-generating advisory services to promising projects, even when we do not make direct investments. The combination of financial backing and strategic advisory capabilities strengthens our ability to support high-potential startups in the Web3 space, while also creating a significant revenue stream for the Company.

The first Web3 Start-Up Pitch Day, held on 30 July 2024, attracted a strong pool of high-quality projects, reflecting a strong interest in the initiative. These pitch days are designed to vet projects from both an investment and advisory perspective, allowing us to be selective in the clients we work with. As we look forward to the next pitch day on 2 October 2024, we are confident this initiative will provide us with a strong pipeline of high-potential startup candidates for both investment and advisory services.

This collaboration with Liteflow strengthens our position in the Web3 market and underpins the long-term growth prospects of our advisory services division, which is expected to play a key role in driving Coinsilium's future revenue streams.

Otomato: A High-Potential, Fast-Accelerating Project with Near-Term Growth Catalysts

Coinsilium's recent investment in Otomato, secured via a SAFT, marks a pivotal entry into the rapidly growing Web3 automation space. Otomato's platform is designed to simplify blockchain development for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders by allowing them to automate on-chain actions in response to off-chain events. This innovation addresses a critical need in the DeFi sector for accessible, automated strategies and has garnered substantial interest from the industry, signalling significant potential for rapid growth.

Coinsilium holds a USD75,000 stake in Otomato, with an option to acquire an additional USD150,000 in future tokens, making it a key early-stage backer of this promising project. More importantly, Coinsilium is set to benefit from 7.5% of Otomato.xyz's revenues from launch until the Token Listing Event, expected in 2025. As revenues are anticipated to begin when the platform goes live in Q4 2024, this represents a near-term catalyst for Coinsilium's growth, providing a direct avenue for early-stage revenue generation.

Otomato is on an accelerated development timeline, with its public launch slated for Q4 2024. These will pave the way for Otomato to start generating affiliate and transaction fees as early as this year. The project is gaining considerable industry traction, as demonstrated by its participation in the MODE Yield Accelerator and the strong engagement of early testers during the beta phase. With over 2,150 followers and an active community, the platform is poised to rapidly expand its user base and establish a foothold in the burgeoning DeFi market.

Given the strong interest from the DeFi sector and the speed of Otomato's development, Coinsilium is optimistic about its potential for significant long-term value creation. The upcoming platform launch, and the eventual Token Listing Event will be critical milestones, and we look forward to providing regular updates as Otomato continues its fast-paced growth. Shareholders are encouraged to follow Otomato closely, since the project is advancing more quickly than expected, driven by high levels of interest from the DeFi community.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we move into what looks to be a more favourable and positive environment for the cryptocurrency market, there is much to look forward to for Coinsilium and its shareholders. With Bitcoin's strengthening market position and the expectation of further liquidity entering the market, the conditions are aligning for significant opportunities across the broader blockchain and Web3 sectors.

Coinsilium is now well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, thanks to the work undertaken over the last two years to strategically build and expand our investment and advisory operations. Our efforts have ensured that we are prepared to leverage the upcoming bull market, with our projects and partnerships fully aligned to drive growth. We are confident that this groundwork sets the stage for both short and medium term value generation while laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

Finally, the Board would like to express its sincere gratitude to our valued shareholders, partners, and team members for their continued support. With signs of favourable market conditions persisting, evidenced by the continual improvement in cryptocurrency markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on the ongoing developments and news from our existing portfolio of investments and advisory projects, which we believe will demonstrate significant progress throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

COINSILIUM GROUP LIMITED NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Preparation

The principal business of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the ""Group"") is investing in and accelerating blockchain technology companies, together with a venture builder and token and NFT sale strategic adviser. The finances innovative blockchain companies, with the intent of supporting the further development and commercialisation of these technologies. The Group also provides advisory and promotional services to technology startups and companies looking to undertake NFT sales and issue tokens via Token Generation Events such as Initial Coin Offerings.

The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Aquis Growth Market listing rules for Companies and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union. As permitted, the consolidated interim financial statements have not been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'.

2. Financial Information

The consolidated interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts. They have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the requirements of the Aquis Growth Market listing rules for Companies and the recognition and measurement criteria of IFRS. Except as described below, the accounting policies applied in preparing the interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those that have been adopted in the Group's 2023 audited financial statements. Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 were approved by the Board of Directors on 27 June 2024. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.

Going concern

The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.

Risks and uncertainties

The key risks that could affect the Group's short- and medium-term performance, and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the Group's 2023Annual Report and Financial Statements, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.coinsilium.com. The Group's key financial risks are liquidity, equity securities price risk and foreign exchange movements.

Accounting policies

The preparation of consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in note 4 of the Group's 2023 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period. The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the measurement to fair value of certain financial instruments.

Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

There are no new and amended IFRS standards that are effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 January 2024 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

The consolidated interim financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2024 and for the 6 months period ended 30 June 2023 have not been reviewed or audited.

3. Directors Remuneration

Directors of the Company received total remuneration of GBP203,169 for the 6 months ended 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: GBP204,921).

4. Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the total comprehensive income attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

Weighted As at 30 June 2024 As at 30 June 2023 average number of Earnings per Share Earnings per Share Shares GBP No. GBP GBP Basic EPS Earnings attributable to shareholders 29,545 209,110,611 0.01 (0.06)

There were no potentially dilutive instruments in issue for which the exercise price was less than the average share price for the period of report. Consequently, no fully diluted earnings per share has been presented in these interim financial statements for the current period. In the prior period, the Group operated to a loss such that the effects of the exercise of any such instruments would be anti-dilutive.

5. Financial Assets at fair value through profit and loss

At 30 June 2024, the Company owns unlisted shares in:

-- Greengage Global Holding Ltd, a company incorporated in UK;

-- StartupToken Singapore Pte. Ltd. in Singapore;

-- Coin-Dash Ltd, a company incorporated in Israel; and

6. Dividends

The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend.

7. Asset acquisition in the period

During the prior period, the Group acquired the client book of the Tokenomi Web3 advisory business for total consideration of GBP116,500 payable through the issuance of GBP97,500 of fully paid ordinary shares in the Company and GBP19,000 in cash. The company considers the acquisition of the advisory client book represents an asset under IAS 38 and as such the cost of acquisition has been recognised as an intangible asset during the period.

As at the prior period reporting date no consideration for the acquisition had been paid. Consequently, the shares element of consideration payable was recognised within the Shares to issue reserve and the cash element of consideration payable had been recognised in Trade and other payables. The acquisition shares associated with the above were allotted during the 6-month period to 31 December 2023 and hence the shares to issue reserve was reduced to nil in that period, giving rise to a nil balance brought foreward in the reserves for the current period. 8. Approval of Interim Financial Statements

The interim financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 26 September 2024.

DIRECTORS' STATEMENT

The Company ended the period under review with over GBP0.4m cash at bank and GBP1.1m in other current assets including Cryptocurrencies, tokens and rights to future tokens.

The digital asset markets have recovered significantly since the start of the reporting period, which has had a markedly positive impact on the Company's cryptocurrency holdings as the profit from continuing operations increased to GBP29,545 from a loss of GBP104,247 in H1 2023.

Throughout the period, Coinsilium continued to make solid operational progress across its investment and advisory activities, and we are pleased to provide details of developments and significant news released to the market during the reporting period:

Investment Portfolio Update

Indorse and Byzant Web3 Ecosystem

On 29 January 2024, the Company provided an update regarding its investee, Web3 development company Indorse Pte. Ltd. (""Indorse""), and the ongoing collaboration with Indorse on the 'Byzant Web3 Social Network Ecosystem' (""the Collaboration""). The primary focus of this collaboration has been on the development of a range of Web3 applications. One such application, the Bastion Wallet was launched in August 2023 and enables both seasoned crypto users and newcomers to seamlessly interact with Web3 applications.

Additionally, Indorse's technical team has been working closely with A-ADS one of the longest-established and largest crypto and Bitcoin advertising networks, to develop Adbazaar, a decentralised advertising platform tailored for Web3 advertisers and publishers.

The involvement of A-ADS, whose core team brings 13 years of experience in crypto-based advertising, alongside Coinsilium and Indorse, reinforces the depth of expertise driving the development of the Byzant Web3 Ecosystem.

Web3 advertising presents a highly promising but still underdeveloped opportunity compared to its well-established role as a revenue driver in Web2 social media. Coinsilium views early movers in the Web3 advertising space, such as Adbazaar, as being well-positioned to capitalise on this emerging market. While Adbazaar is still in its development phase, the project holds significant potential to leverage early entry into the Web3 advertising landscape. Backed by industry veterans like A-ADS, the project aims to position itself as a competitive player, ready to capitalise on the nascent revenue opportunities in this sector.

Throughout the period, Adbazaar has been the primary focus for the Collaboration, due to its clearer path toward commercialisation and potential to generate early revenues. As the project gains traction in the Web3 advertising market, it will provide a solid foundation for developing the additional applications within the Byzant ecosystem. This approach allows us to focus on more immediate opportunities, while the broader range of applications will be prioritised once Adbazaar is fully refined and ready for launch.

Managing these steps carefully is essential for ensuring long-term scalability and success. The latest version of the Adbazaar platform is currently being tested by A-ADS, marking a key milestone in this strategy.

Greengage

Coinsilium holds an equity investment in Greengage Global Holding Limited (""Greengage""). Greengage's core business activity centres on providing distributed e-money account services through partnerships with regulated payments-as-a-service firms, tailored to entrepreneurs, SMEs, family offices, and digital asset firms. Greengage offers its clients personal and business e-money accounts in over 50 currencies, including GBP, EUR, and USD. Clients benefit from 24/7 account access and a dedicated relationship manager for personalised support. The services include faster payments, CHAPS, and SEPA payment services, with access to SWIFT payments and Foreign Exchange (FX) depending on the chosen regulated partner provider.

Greengage also provides value-added services through a network of third-party providers. One such service is B2B loans, with the platform facilitating over a quarter of a billion USD in lending since its inception. An example of an innovative product is lending in fiat against tradable cryptocurrencies on a non-recourse basis to provide growth capital, alongside other unique financial solutions.

During the period Greengage notified Coinsilium that it has signed an agreement with a new regulated partner to bring forward the launch of its USD currency accounts (as well as several other currencies including CHF, SEK and CAD) along with FX and SWIFT payments for its clients.

This is significant news as there still remain very few ""crypto friendly"" payment providers offering USD accounts. Greengage management expect that this new agreement will both help to attract new clients for their services as well as strengthen their existing client relationships. Greengage also advised that they continue to maintain a healthy pipeline for new account opening submissions.

Post Period Developments

On 5 July 2024 Greengage announced news of a new collaboration with global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to originate SME debt on the Coinbase Diamond Protocol. This collaboration seeks to utilise blockchain technology to provide SMEs with access to capital, promising a more efficient and transparent financing solution. The Coinbase Diamond protocol enhances the issuance and management of private capital. Using blockchain technology, the protocol issues native digital debt, making the process more secure and accessible to a broader range of investors.

In early September Greengage announced that it has been selected from over 1,228 applications to join 20 other startups in Hub71's 15th cohort in Abu Dhabi, as part of the Hub71+ Digital Assets program. At the same time, Greengage announced that it has established its first office in Abu Dhabi from where it aims to scale and grow its operations within this global tech hub.

Further information on Greengage is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Coindash

Coindash's main product is the SSV Network. Ssv.network is a fully decentralized, open-source ETH staking network, based on Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology. Ethereum validators are required to stake 32 ETH and operate a software validator client alongside legacy and Beacon Chain nodes. This process introduces complexity, especially as the creation of a validator results in a crucial Validator Key responsible for transaction signing. SSV Network addresses this complexity, enhancing validator key security, and delivering benefits to the broader Ethereum network, staking pools, services, and individual stakers.

September 27, 2024 06:51 ET (10:51 GMT)

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -2-

There are currently 11,233,472 SSV tokens in circulation.

As of 16 August 2024, these were the SSV Network metrics:

. 878 Operators

. 41,642 Validators

. 1,332,544 Staked ETH

. USD3.495Bn TVL (Total Valued Locked)

Revaluation of Coindash Interest

As of 31 December 2023, the price of the SSV token stood at USD6.83 per token. By 30 June 2024 at the end of the reporting period, the token price had increased to USD36.09, with a peak of USD61.30 per token recorded on 26 March 2024 with a fully diluted market capitalization for the total supply of SSV tokens at USUSD713.4 million.

Given the substantial SSV token holdings in Coindash's cryptocurrency treasury and the significant price appreciation of SSV tokens throughout the reporting period, the Company has determined to revalue its interest in Coindash. This decision is grounded in the material increase in the value of Coindash's liquid SSV holdings, and the revaluation is applied pro-rata to the Company's stake in Coindash.

While the price of the SSV token experienced a significant increase of 528% over the reporting period, the Company's revalued its stake in Coindash by 346%, adjusted to reflect the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) performance of the SSV token. This adjustment takes into account the fluctuations in SSV tokens market liquidity and its overall trading volume during the period.

Silta Finance

Coinsilium holds a convertible loan and option interest in Silta. During the period, Silta notified Coinsilium that it had received an investment from a top 10 global infrastructure development bank (""Bank"") as part of a strategic partnership agreement to build a climate financing marketplace, powered by AI, for bankability and sustainability assessments. This strategic partnership aims to help support governments, infrastructure developers, and financial institutions to reach their goals of deploying USUSD800B towards Climate Financing by 2030. Silta's strategic partnership with the Bank aims to create the benchmark for climate financing due diligence, thereby unlocking an USUSD800B opportunity within Asian markets, opening the door to a USUSD1.3T global market for projects driving the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.

Post Period Developments

In a recent update Silta advised its shareholders that is has been building on its work over the last 8 month and is now working on a contract extension with a global bank to continue the development of its white-label solution as they prepare to go into production-grade and publicly launch the platform.

On 14 September 2023 Coinsilium announced that Seedcoin, its 100% owned Gibraltar subsidiary, had signed a Convertible Loan Agreement and Option Agreement with Silta as a cornerstone investor in their funding round. The Convertible Loan Agreement provided a loan principal amount of USD50,000 at a pre-money valuation of USD5m. The loan was granted for a period of six months, converting at maturity into 22,306 new common shares of Silta at a price of USD 2.2416 per share.

As at the time of this report we note that there has been a delay in the issuance of the new shares, and it is expected that the new shares will be issued to Coinsilium within the coming weeks. The Option Agreement for up to USD500,000 provides the rights to subscribe to up to 163,575 new shares in Silta at a pre-money valuation of USD7.5m valid for 12 months from 8 September 2023.

An addendum to the Option Agreement was executed on 16 September 2024 whereby the parties agreed on an extension of the Long-Stop Date by 6 months which effectively means that the Option Agreement will now be valid till 7 March 2025.

Web3 Investment Portfolio

Yellow Network

Coinsilium holds a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (""SAFT"") in Yellow Network, a Layer-3 decentralised Broker Clearing Network powered by State Channels used for communicating and trading between brokers and aggregating liquidity of connected nodes. Exchanges, brokers, and trading firms connect to the P2P network using a unified communication protocol. The main target of Yellow Network is to interconnect all blockchains unlocking access to liquidity for truly decentralised, cross-chain and ultra-high-speed trading. The Yellow Network public launch and token listing is slated for Q4 2024. The token listing is a critical milestone since, once tokens are issued and listed on an exchange, this will provide for a mark-to-market valuation reference point for Coinsilium's investment and potential liquidity event subject to vesting terms.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens, vesting over a period of time. At this stage the Company cannot disclose specific details regarding price or number of Tokens to be received. Further details will be provided by way of an update to the market in due course, when the Company is able to do so.

Post Period Developments

On 18 September 2024 Yellow Network announced that it had closed a USUSD10 million seed round led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and other notable investors including leading Ethereum developer Consensys, crypto market-making and trading firm GSR and crypto native VC firm Moonrock Capital. The Yellow Network public launch and token listing is slated for Q4 2024.

Further information on Yellow Network is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

GGs.io

Coinsilium holds a SAFT in GGs.io, as announced on 22 June 2022. GGs.io serves as a gateway to the Latin American (LatAm) market for AAA and Web3 game studios and is currently in the process of establishing a gaming-focused fund aimed at acquiring and managing digital assets in the gaming sector.

Other Corporate Developments

Subscription and Placing

On 8 March 2024, Coinsilium announced a strategic financing done via a combination of a placing and subscription, raised GBP472,500 through the issue of 18,900,000 new ordinary shares of no-par value (""Ordinary Shares"") in the Company at an issue price of 2.5p per share (""Financing Shares""). Included within the Financing, Malcolm Palle (Executive Chairman) and Eddy Travia (Chief Executive Officer) participated with a subscription of GBP40,000 in total. In addition, 3,356,000 Ordinary Shares were issued on the same terms as the Financing Shares for payments totalling GBP83,900 in respect of a broad range of business support, marketing and communications services, designed primarily to broaden awareness of the Company's value proposition and attract a wider range of on-market investors (""Service Shares""). Each Financing Share and Service Share included an attaching warrant to subscribe for a further new ordinary share at an exercise price of 3.75p and with a life to expiry of 3 years from Admission to trading of the new Ordinary Shares, pursuant to the Financing (in total 22,256,000 ""Financing and Service Warrants""). The Financing underpins the Company's working capital position and importantly, enables an acceleration of certain operational and investing activities at a time when AI and Web3 are rapidly advancing and Coinsilium wishes to remain at the forefront of various Web3 technology initiatives.

Advisory Services - LC LITE/ NEXADE

On 20 February 2024 Coinsilium announced it had signed an agreement with global trade exchange platform LC Lite (""LC Lite"") for strategic advisory services in respect of the forthcoming token launch. LC Lite was recently acquired by Incomlend, a regulated global invoice finance marketplace for SMEs with licenses to operate in Singapore and in Hong Kong. LC Lite aims to bring Web3 decentralised technology to Incomlend, with improved marketplace liquidity, multi-currency solutions for cross-border export financing and a broad usage of stablecoins. The project has since been rebranded and launched as NEXADE and is well positioned to capitalise on emerging business opportunities from within the fast-growing digital asset market.

The scope of the work undertaken by Coinsilium includes advising LC Lite on its project token economics (Tokenomics) ahead of its planned token launch, slated for Q4 2024. Additionally, Coinsilium is facilitating introductions for LC Lite to potential partners drawn from Coinsilium's extensive network of major service providers and cryptocurrency firms. Advisory service terms pertaining to advisory engagements are commercially sensitive and subject to mutual confidentiality agreements. Typically, an agreement will include a 'sign on' payment and a final success payment. The success payment will usually be a fixed fee, denominated in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum or in project digital tokens and will be payable on the successful completion of a project's Token Generating Event (""TGE"").

Further information on NEXADE is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

New Web3 Industry and Portfolio Reports

On 3 April 2024 Coinsilium announced the launch of a new series of Web3 industry reports. These reports aim to provide investors with a greater understanding of the emerging Web3 space, offering insights into the applications, use cases, and the blockchain technology underpinning it. The reports also feature some of the projects that make up Coinsilium's investment and advisory services portfolio. To-date we have produced seven reports, all of which are available for download from a dedicated section on the Coinsilium website: https://www.coinsilium.com/investors/ web3-reports

Post Period Events

Strategic Web3 Collaboration with Liteflow

On 2 July 2024 Coinsilium announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MoU"") with Liteflow, Inc (""Liteflow""), an experienced Web3 and NFT technical developer. The MoU is the first step in a planned long-term strategic collaboration between Coinsilium and Liteflow, which aims to provide financial backing, comprehensive advisory services, and cutting-edge technological resources to help budding companies navigate the complexities of the Web3 landscape and maximize their chances of long-term business success.

SAFT to acquire Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol Tokens

On 3 July 2024 Consilium announced that it had entered into a SAFT with the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol. Otomato is designed to simplify interactions with DeFi platforms through automation and user-friendly interfaces. It can help bridge the gap for DeFi traders without coding skills by automating complex tasks and providing clear, intuitive guides.

Otomato.xyz is the first decentralised application of the Protocol and enables De-Fi traders to create and automate their own Web3 trading strategies as a succession of on-chain actions which can integrate reactions to off-chain events. User control and security on the platform are ensured through account abstraction (ERC-4337), making blockchain automation accessible and efficient for all users.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD75,000 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Early Backers' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. Coinsilium also has the option to acquire an additional USD150,150 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Strategic' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. In addition, Coinsilium will earn 7.5% of revenues generated by the Otomato.xyz platform up to the time of the Token Listing Event, anticipated to occur during 2025.

Revenues will be predominantly derived from affiliate fees from actions executed through integrated protocols and fees from transactions initiated via the Otomato.xyz platform. The public launch of the platform is expected by Q4 2024, when revenues would be expected to commence.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Elevate Health

Elevate Health has progressed in its transformation into a decentralised science (DeSci) project, focusing on creating a platform that rewards members for contributing and accessing data, research, and treatments in preventative healthcare.

The project is currently in discussions with a prominent, yet undisclosed, decentralised launchpad, which has raised approximately USD1 billion for various token projects over the past three years. It is noteworthy that DeSci-related tokens have shown strong post-launch performance compared to other sectors.

Elevate Health has advised Coinsilium that it is targeting a potential token issuance by the end of 2024. Further updates will be provided to the market as and when available.

Arcadian Youth Pte Ltd (formerly ""StartupToken"")

StartupToken has successfully transitioned its business model to focus on Web3 Real World Asset (""RWA"") tokenization, with an initial emphasis on the Bali real estate market.

The company's flagship application, Propex, is now in the advanced stages of development. Propex is designed to streamline the transaction of real estate assets by bringing ownership transfers onto the blockchain. This aims to automate and simplify the process for property owners and their counterparties by tokenizing property contracts into unique, programmable assets (NFTs). These NFTs can be used for various Web3 applications, such as trading, collateralized loans, and more. Propex offers real estate agents and notaries a minting service to create on-chain proof of ownership, while maintaining the existing system of record. The blockchain-based records serve as tamper-proof, verified copies that co-exist with the traditional system until full adoption of on-chain processes. While the initial market focus is on Bali, Indonesia, the Propex solution has potential applications in other regions beyond this initial market.

The Arcadian Youth team recently updated the Company, reporting that the first development stage of the blockchain-based application has been completed. In this initial phase, the application allows users to mint 'location NFTs,' enabling them to participate in challenges and earn points. The second stage will introduce the ability for property owners to mint their real estate NFTs, with notary verification, unlocking access to decentralised finance (DeFi) and RWA exchange platforms.

Additionally, the team informed us that their application for a grant from Lisk, a Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum and part of the Optimism Superchain, was successful. Lisk is focused on providing solutions for emerging markets through the tokenization of RWAs, which aligns well with Propex's goals.

We will continue to update the market with news and developments regarding Propex as the project progresses.

Outlook

Bitcoin's sharp rise throughout the period in review, culminating in a new all-time high prior to the May 'halving' event, diverged from historic cycles, where such peaks are usually observed after the halving.

This early surge fuelled a degree of overexuberance, which in turn contributed to significant price fluctuations and heightened volatility post period to date, albeit that Bitcoin is now trading at significantly higher price levels than it was during the reporting period.

The recent volatility in the market has ultimately strengthened Bitcoin's position in the hands of longer-term holders, setting the stage for a more resilient recovery, which we are now beginning to witness.

The recent 50 basis point interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in four years, combined with the expectation of increased market liquidity, bolsters our confidence that a recovery in the crypto markets is well underway. We anticipate this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, with 2025 expected to bring even greater strength to the market which in turn should create a more favourable environment for investment and growth across the broader sector.

Coinsilium's efforts over the past two years, to strategically position itself for this anticipated positive market phase, are now starting to bear fruit. During this period, we have focused on expanding and scaling our advisory services capabilities, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the expected bull market in the Web3 sector. Our structured approach not only drives forward key strategic initiatives but also lays a strong foundation for both short and medium-term value generation. Most importantly, these efforts set the stage for sustained long-term growth as we continue to leverage our expertise and strategic positioning in this rapidly evolving market.

Anticipated Yellow Token Launch and Listing in Q4 2024

(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires

September 27, 2024 06:51 ET (10:51 GMT)

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -4-

A key catalyst for Coinsilium, expected in Q4 2024, is the upcoming token launch and listing of the Yellow token. As announced 21 April 2022, Coinsilium entered into a USUSD200,000 Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) in Yellow. Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens in this early funding round, vesting over a period of time. The token launch will mark an important liquidity event for the Company, signalling the fruition of a long-term strategic investment.

Yellow Network recently announced that it had secured USD10 million in funding, led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This strategic investment comes as Yellow's market valuation reportedly reaches over USUSD200m, positioning Yellow as a frontrunner in the DeFi trading revolution. Other notable backers and supporters include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. This funding round also highlights the growing confidence in Yellow Network's potential to address key inefficiencies in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, such as liquidity fragmentation and scalability.

With the launch of the Yellow token, Coinsilium will stand to benefit not only from a significant liquidity event but also from the enhanced visibility and market traction Yellow is expected to gain as a result of this strong backing. The involvement of high-profile investors like Chris Larsen further strengthens the case for Yellow's long-term success, which aligns well with Coinsilium's strategic vision.

Investors are encouraged to monitor this event closely, as it not only validates Coinsilium's early-stage investment strategy but also presents a promising opportunity for growth and value realisation.

Yellow is a highly ambitious project, aiming to address key inefficiencies in the DeFi space. Should Yellow meet its objectives, it has the potential to become a key player in the decentralised clearing space, backed by strong investment, experienced partners, and a clear vision.

Further information on Yellow is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Strategic Partnership with Liteflow Driving Web3 Innovation

Following the announcement of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liteflow on 2nd July 2024, we are pleased to report that this strategic collaboration is already showing significant promise. The initiative, which offers USUSD1 million in dedicated seed funding for early-stage Web3 startups, has attracted strong interest from high-quality applicants within DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi sectors. The creation of an Investment Committee as part of the process, composed of both companies and certain pre-approved co-investors, further strengthens this initiative, by ensuring a rigorous procedure for the assessment and selection of projects.

The initiative also integrates Coinsilium's advisory services as a key part of the same offering. This means that, in addition to investment opportunities, we are able to provide fee-generating advisory services to promising projects, even when we do not make direct investments. The combination of financial backing and strategic advisory capabilities strengthens our ability to support high-potential startups in the Web3 space, while also creating a significant revenue stream for the Company.

The first Web3 Start-Up Pitch Day, held on 30 July 2024, attracted a strong pool of high-quality projects, reflecting a strong interest in the initiative. These pitch days are designed to vet projects from both an investment and advisory perspective, allowing us to be selective in the clients we work with. As we look forward to the next pitch day on 2 October 2024, we are confident this initiative will provide us with a strong pipeline of high-potential startup candidates for both investment and advisory services.

This collaboration with Liteflow strengthens our position in the Web3 market and underpins the long-term growth prospects of our advisory services division, which is expected to play a key role in driving Coinsilium's future revenue streams.

Otomato: A High-Potential, Fast-Accelerating Project with Near-Term Growth Catalysts

Coinsilium's recent investment in Otomato, secured via a SAFT, marks a pivotal entry into the rapidly growing Web3 automation space. Otomato's platform is designed to simplify blockchain development for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders by allowing them to automate on-chain actions in response to off-chain events. This innovation addresses a critical need in the DeFi sector for accessible, automated strategies and has garnered substantial interest from the industry, signalling significant potential for rapid growth.

Coinsilium holds a USD75,000 stake in Otomato, with an option to acquire an additional USD150,000 in future tokens, making it a key early-stage backer of this promising project. More importantly, Coinsilium is set to benefit from 7.5% of Otomato.xyz's revenues from launch until the Token Listing Event, expected in 2025. As revenues are anticipated to begin when the platform goes live in Q4 2024, this represents a near-term catalyst for Coinsilium's growth, providing a direct avenue for early-stage revenue generation.

Otomato is on an accelerated development timeline, with its public launch slated for Q4 2024. These will pave the way for Otomato to start generating affiliate and transaction fees as early as this year. The project is gaining considerable industry traction, as demonstrated by its participation in the MODE Yield Accelerator and the strong engagement of early testers during the beta phase. With over 2,150 followers and an active community, the platform is poised to rapidly expand its user base and establish a foothold in the burgeoning DeFi market.

Given the strong interest from the DeFi sector and the speed of Otomato's development, Coinsilium is optimistic about its potential for significant long-term value creation. The upcoming platform launch, and the eventual Token Listing Event will be critical milestones, and we look forward to providing regular updates as Otomato continues its fast-paced growth. Shareholders are encouraged to follow Otomato closely, since the project is advancing more quickly than expected, driven by high levels of interest from the DeFi community.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we move into what looks to be a more favourable and positive environment for the cryptocurrency market, there is much to look forward to for Coinsilium and its shareholders. With Bitcoin's strengthening market position and the expectation of further liquidity entering the market, the conditions are aligning for significant opportunities across the broader blockchain and Web3 sectors.

Coinsilium is now well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, thanks to the work undertaken over the last two years to strategically build and expand our investment and advisory operations. Our efforts have ensured that we are prepared to leverage the upcoming bull market, with our projects and partnerships fully aligned to drive growth. We are confident that this groundwork sets the stage for both short and medium term value generation while laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

Finally, the Board would like to express its sincere gratitude to our valued shareholders, partners, and team members for their continued support. With signs of favourable market conditions persisting, evidenced by the continual improvement in cryptocurrency markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on the ongoing developments and news from our existing portfolio of investments and advisory projects, which we believe will demonstrate significant progress throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 were approved by the Board of Directors on 27 June 2024. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.

Going concern

The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.

Risks and uncertainties

The key risks that could affect the Group's short- and medium-term performance, and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the Group's 2023Annual Report and Financial Statements, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.coinsilium.com. The Group's key financial risks are liquidity, equity securities price risk and foreign exchange movements.

Accounting policies

The preparation of consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in note 4 of the Group's 2023 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period. The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the measurement to fair value of certain financial instruments.

Changes in accounting policies and disclosures

There are no new and amended IFRS standards that are effective for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 January 2024 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

The consolidated interim financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2024 and for the 6 months period ended 30 June 2023 have not been reviewed or audited.

3. Directors Remuneration

Directors of the Company received total remuneration of GBP203,169 for the 6 months ended 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: GBP204,921).

4. Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the total comprehensive income attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

Weighted As at 30 June 2024 As at 30 June 2023 average number of Earnings per Share Earnings per Share Shares GBP No. GBP GBP Basic EPS Earnings attributable to shareholders 29,545 209,110,611 0.01 (0.06)

There were no potentially dilutive instruments in issue for which the exercise price was less than the average share price for the period of report. Consequently, no fully diluted earnings per share has been presented in these interim financial statements for the current period. In the prior period, the Group operated to a loss such that the effects of the exercise of any such instruments would be anti-dilutive.

5. Financial Assets at fair value through profit and loss

At 30 June 2024, the Company owns unlisted shares in:

-- Greengage Global Holding Ltd, a company incorporated in UK;

-- StartupToken Singapore Pte. Ltd. in Singapore;

-- Coin-Dash Ltd, a company incorporated in Israel; and

-- Indorse Pte. Ltd., a company incorporated in Singapore.

DIRECTORS' STATEMENT

The Company ended the period under review with over GBP0.4m cash at bank and GBP1.1m in other current assets including Cryptocurrencies, tokens and rights to future tokens.

The digital asset markets have recovered significantly since the start of the reporting period, which has had a markedly positive impact on the Company's cryptocurrency holdings as the profit from continuing operations increased to GBP29,545 from a loss of GBP104,247 in H1 2023.

Throughout the period, Coinsilium continued to make solid operational progress across its investment and advisory activities, and we are pleased to provide details of developments and significant news released to the market during the reporting period:

Investment Portfolio Update

Indorse and Byzant Web3 Ecosystem

On 29 January 2024, the Company provided an update regarding its investee, Web3 development company Indorse Pte. Ltd. (""Indorse""), and the ongoing collaboration with Indorse on the 'Byzant Web3 Social Network Ecosystem' (""the Collaboration""). The primary focus of this collaboration has been on the development of a range of Web3 applications. One such application, the Bastion Wallet was launched in August 2023 and enables both seasoned crypto users and newcomers to seamlessly interact with Web3 applications.

Additionally, Indorse's technical team has been working closely with A-ADS one of the longest-established and largest crypto and Bitcoin advertising networks, to develop Adbazaar, a decentralised advertising platform tailored for Web3 advertisers and publishers.

The involvement of A-ADS, whose core team brings 13 years of experience in crypto-based advertising, alongside Coinsilium and Indorse, reinforces the depth of expertise driving the development of the Byzant Web3 Ecosystem.

Web3 advertising presents a highly promising but still underdeveloped opportunity compared to its well-established role as a revenue driver in Web2 social media. Coinsilium views early movers in the Web3 advertising space, such as Adbazaar, as being well-positioned to capitalise on this emerging market. While Adbazaar is still in its development phase, the project holds significant potential to leverage early entry into the Web3 advertising landscape. Backed by industry veterans like A-ADS, the project aims to position itself as a competitive player, ready to capitalise on the nascent revenue opportunities in this sector.

Throughout the period, Adbazaar has been the primary focus for the Collaboration, due to its clearer path toward commercialisation and potential to generate early revenues. As the project gains traction in the Web3 advertising market, it will provide a solid foundation for developing the additional applications within the Byzant ecosystem. This approach allows us to focus on more immediate opportunities, while the broader range of applications will be prioritised once Adbazaar is fully refined and ready for launch.

Managing these steps carefully is essential for ensuring long-term scalability and success. The latest version of the Adbazaar platform is currently being tested by A-ADS, marking a key milestone in this strategy.

Greengage

Coinsilium holds an equity investment in Greengage Global Holding Limited (""Greengage""). Greengage's core business activity centres on providing distributed e-money account services through partnerships with regulated payments-as-a-service firms, tailored to entrepreneurs, SMEs, family offices, and digital asset firms. Greengage offers its clients personal and business e-money accounts in over 50 currencies, including GBP, EUR, and USD. Clients benefit from 24/7 account access and a dedicated relationship manager for personalised support. The services include faster payments, CHAPS, and SEPA payment services, with access to SWIFT payments and Foreign Exchange (FX) depending on the chosen regulated partner provider.

Greengage also provides value-added services through a network of third-party providers. One such service is B2B loans, with the platform facilitating over a quarter of a billion USD in lending since its inception. An example of an innovative product is lending in fiat against tradable cryptocurrencies on a non-recourse basis to provide growth capital, alongside other unique financial solutions.

During the period Greengage notified Coinsilium that it has signed an agreement with a new regulated partner to bring forward the launch of its USD currency accounts (as well as several other currencies including CHF, SEK and CAD) along with FX and SWIFT payments for its clients.

This is significant news as there still remain very few ""crypto friendly"" payment providers offering USD accounts. Greengage management expect that this new agreement will both help to attract new clients for their services as well as strengthen their existing client relationships. Greengage also advised that they continue to maintain a healthy pipeline for new account opening submissions.

Post Period Developments

On 5 July 2024 Greengage announced news of a new collaboration with global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to originate SME debt on the Coinbase Diamond Protocol. This collaboration seeks to utilise blockchain technology to provide SMEs with access to capital, promising a more efficient and transparent financing solution. The Coinbase Diamond protocol enhances the issuance and management of private capital. Using blockchain technology, the protocol issues native digital debt, making the process more secure and accessible to a broader range of investors.

In early September Greengage announced that it has been selected from over 1,228 applications to join 20 other startups in Hub71's 15th cohort in Abu Dhabi, as part of the Hub71+ Digital Assets program. At the same time, Greengage announced that it has established its first office in Abu Dhabi from where it aims to scale and grow its operations within this global tech hub.

Further information on Greengage is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Coindash

Coindash's main product is the SSV Network. Ssv.network is a fully decentralized, open-source ETH staking network, based on Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology. Ethereum validators are required to stake 32 ETH and operate a software validator client alongside legacy and Beacon Chain nodes. This process introduces complexity, especially as the creation of a validator results in a crucial Validator Key responsible for transaction signing. SSV Network addresses this complexity, enhancing validator key security, and delivering benefits to the broader Ethereum network, staking pools, services, and individual stakers.

(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires

September 27, 2024 06:51 ET (10:51 GMT)

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -2-

There are currently 11,233,472 SSV tokens in circulation.

As of 16 August 2024, these were the SSV Network metrics:

. 878 Operators

. 41,642 Validators

. 1,332,544 Staked ETH

. USD3.495Bn TVL (Total Valued Locked)

Revaluation of Coindash Interest

As of 31 December 2023, the price of the SSV token stood at USD6.83 per token. By 30 June 2024 at the end of the reporting period, the token price had increased to USD36.09, with a peak of USD61.30 per token recorded on 26 March 2024 with a fully diluted market capitalization for the total supply of SSV tokens at USUSD713.4 million.

Given the substantial SSV token holdings in Coindash's cryptocurrency treasury and the significant price appreciation of SSV tokens throughout the reporting period, the Company has determined to revalue its interest in Coindash. This decision is grounded in the material increase in the value of Coindash's liquid SSV holdings, and the revaluation is applied pro-rata to the Company's stake in Coindash.

While the price of the SSV token experienced a significant increase of 528% over the reporting period, the Company's revalued its stake in Coindash by 346%, adjusted to reflect the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) performance of the SSV token. This adjustment takes into account the fluctuations in SSV tokens market liquidity and its overall trading volume during the period.

Silta Finance

Coinsilium holds a convertible loan and option interest in Silta. During the period, Silta notified Coinsilium that it had received an investment from a top 10 global infrastructure development bank (""Bank"") as part of a strategic partnership agreement to build a climate financing marketplace, powered by AI, for bankability and sustainability assessments. This strategic partnership aims to help support governments, infrastructure developers, and financial institutions to reach their goals of deploying USUSD800B towards Climate Financing by 2030. Silta's strategic partnership with the Bank aims to create the benchmark for climate financing due diligence, thereby unlocking an USUSD800B opportunity within Asian markets, opening the door to a USUSD1.3T global market for projects driving the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.

Post Period Developments

In a recent update Silta advised its shareholders that is has been building on its work over the last 8 month and is now working on a contract extension with a global bank to continue the development of its white-label solution as they prepare to go into production-grade and publicly launch the platform.

On 14 September 2023 Coinsilium announced that Seedcoin, its 100% owned Gibraltar subsidiary, had signed a Convertible Loan Agreement and Option Agreement with Silta as a cornerstone investor in their funding round. The Convertible Loan Agreement provided a loan principal amount of USD50,000 at a pre-money valuation of USD5m. The loan was granted for a period of six months, converting at maturity into 22,306 new common shares of Silta at a price of USD 2.2416 per share.

As at the time of this report we note that there has been a delay in the issuance of the new shares, and it is expected that the new shares will be issued to Coinsilium within the coming weeks. The Option Agreement for up to USD500,000 provides the rights to subscribe to up to 163,575 new shares in Silta at a pre-money valuation of USD7.5m valid for 12 months from 8 September 2023.

An addendum to the Option Agreement was executed on 16 September 2024 whereby the parties agreed on an extension of the Long-Stop Date by 6 months which effectively means that the Option Agreement will now be valid till 7 March 2025.

Yellow Network

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens, vesting over a period of time. At this stage the Company cannot disclose specific details regarding price or number of Tokens to be received.

Post Period Events

Strategic Web3 Collaboration with Liteflow

On 2 July 2024 Coinsilium announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MoU"") with Liteflow, Inc (""Liteflow""), an experienced Web3 and NFT technical developer. The MoU is the first step in a planned long-term strategic collaboration between Coinsilium and Liteflow, which aims to provide financial backing, comprehensive advisory services, and cutting-edge technological resources to help budding companies navigate the complexities of the Web3 landscape and maximize their chances of long-term business success.

SAFT to acquire Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol Tokens

On 3 July 2024 Consilium announced that it had entered into a SAFT with the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol. Otomato is designed to simplify interactions with DeFi platforms through automation and user-friendly interfaces. It can help bridge the gap for DeFi traders without coding skills by automating complex tasks and providing clear, intuitive guides.

Otomato.xyz is the first decentralised application of the Protocol and enables De-Fi traders to create and automate their own Web3 trading strategies as a succession of on-chain actions which can integrate reactions to off-chain events. User control and security on the platform are ensured through account abstraction (ERC-4337), making blockchain automation accessible and efficient for all users.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD75,000 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Early Backers' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. Coinsilium also has the option to acquire an additional USD150,150 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Strategic' token allocation pricing and vesting terms.

Elevate Health

Elevate Health has progressed in its transformation into a decentralised science (DeSci) project, focusing on creating a platform that rewards members for contributing and accessing data, research, and treatments in preventative healthcare.

The project is currently in discussions with a prominent, yet undisclosed, decentralised launchpad, which has raised approximately USD1 billion for various token projects over the past three years. It is noteworthy that DeSci-related tokens have shown strong post-launch performance compared to other sectors.

Elevate Health has advised Coinsilium that it is targeting a potential token issuance by the end of 2024. Further updates will be provided to the market as and when available.

Arcadian Youth Pte Ltd (formerly ""StartupToken"")

StartupToken has successfully transitioned its business model to focus on Web3 Real World Asset (""RWA"") tokenization, with an initial emphasis on the Bali real estate market.

The company's flagship application, Propex, is now in the advanced stages of development. Propex is designed to streamline the transaction of real estate assets by bringing ownership transfers onto the blockchain. This aims to automate and simplify the process for property owners and their counterparties by tokenizing property contracts into unique, programmable assets (NFTs). These NFTs can be used for various Web3 applications, such as trading, collateralized loans, and more. Propex offers real estate agents and notaries a minting service to create on-chain proof of ownership, while maintaining the existing system of record. The blockchain-based records serve as tamper-proof, verified copies that co-exist with the traditional system until full adoption of on-chain processes. While the initial market focus is on Bali, Indonesia, the Propex solution has potential applications in other regions beyond this initial market.

The Arcadian Youth team recently updated the Company, reporting that the first development stage of the blockchain-based application has been completed. In this initial phase, the application allows users to mint 'location NFTs,' enabling them to participate in challenges and earn points. The second stage will introduce the ability for property owners to mint their real estate NFTs, with notary verification, unlocking access to decentralised finance (DeFi) and RWA exchange platforms.

Additionally, the team informed us that their application for a grant from Lisk, a Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum and part of the Optimism Superchain, was successful. Lisk is focused on providing solutions for emerging markets through the tokenization of RWAs, which aligns well with Propex's goals.

We will continue to update the market with news and developments regarding Propex as the project progresses.

Each Service Share has an attaching warrant to subscribe for a further new ordinary share at an exercise price of 3.75p and with a life to expiry of 3 years from Admission to trading of the new Service Shares. The Service Shares and attaching one warrant for one ordinary share were issued on the same terms as the Company's most recent financing, announced 8 March 2024.

Outlook

Bitcoin's sharp rise throughout the period in review, culminating in a new all-time high prior to the May 'halving' event, diverged from historic cycles, where such peaks are usually observed after the halving.

This early surge fuelled a degree of overexuberance, which in turn contributed to significant price fluctuations and heightened volatility post period to date, albeit that Bitcoin is now trading at significantly higher price levels than it was during the reporting period.

The recent volatility in the market has ultimately strengthened Bitcoin's position in the hands of longer-term holders, setting the stage for a more resilient recovery, which we are now beginning to witness.

The recent 50 basis point interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in four years, combined with the expectation of increased market liquidity, bolsters our confidence that a recovery in the crypto markets is well underway. We anticipate this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, with 2025 expected to bring even greater strength to the market which in turn should create a more favourable environment for investment and growth across the broader sector.

Coinsilium's efforts over the past two years, to strategically position itself for this anticipated positive market phase, are now starting to bear fruit. During this period, we have focused on expanding and scaling our advisory services capabilities, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the expected bull market in the Web3 sector. Our structured approach not only drives forward key strategic initiatives but also lays a strong foundation for both short and medium-term value generation. Most importantly, these efforts set the stage for sustained long-term growth as we continue to leverage our expertise and strategic positioning in this rapidly evolving market.

Yellow Network recently announced that it had secured USD10 million in funding, led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This strategic investment comes as Yellow's market valuation reportedly reaches over USUSD200m, positioning Yellow as a frontrunner in the DeFi trading revolution. Other notable backers and supporters include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. This funding round also highlights the growing confidence in Yellow Network's potential to address key inefficiencies in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, such as liquidity fragmentation and scalability.

With the launch of the Yellow token, Coinsilium will stand to benefit not only from a significant liquidity event but also from the enhanced visibility and market traction Yellow is expected to gain as a result of this strong backing. The involvement of high-profile investors like Chris Larsen further strengthens the case for Yellow's long-term success, which aligns well with Coinsilium's strategic vision.

Investors are encouraged to monitor this event closely, as it not only validates Coinsilium's early-stage investment strategy but also presents a promising opportunity for growth and value realisation.

Yellow is a highly ambitious project, aiming to address key inefficiencies in the DeFi space. Should Yellow meet its objectives, it has the potential to become a key player in the decentralised clearing space, backed by strong investment, experienced partners, and a clear vision.

Strategic Partnership with Liteflow Driving Web3 Innovation

Following the announcement of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liteflow on 2nd July 2024, we are pleased to report that this strategic collaboration is already showing significant promise. The initiative, which offers USUSD1 million in dedicated seed funding for early-stage Web3 startups, has attracted strong interest from high-quality applicants within DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi sectors. The creation of an Investment Committee as part of the process, composed of both companies and certain pre-approved co-investors, further strengthens this initiative, by ensuring a rigorous procedure for the assessment and selection of projects.

The initiative also integrates Coinsilium's advisory services as a key part of the same offering. This means that, in addition to investment opportunities, we are able to provide fee-generating advisory services to promising projects, even when we do not make direct investments. The combination of financial backing and strategic advisory capabilities strengthens our ability to support high-potential startups in the Web3 space, while also creating a significant revenue stream for the Company.

The first Web3 Start-Up Pitch Day, held on 30 July 2024, attracted a strong pool of high-quality projects, reflecting a strong interest in the initiative. These pitch days are designed to vet projects from both an investment and advisory perspective, allowing us to be selective in the clients we work with. As we look forward to the next pitch day on 2 October 2024, we are confident this initiative will provide us with a strong pipeline of high-potential startup candidates for both investment and advisory services.

This collaboration with Liteflow strengthens our position in the Web3 market and underpins the long-term growth prospects of our advisory services division, which is expected to play a key role in driving Coinsilium's future revenue streams.

Otomato: A High-Potential, Fast-Accelerating Project with Near-Term Growth Catalysts

Coinsilium's recent investment in Otomato, secured via a SAFT, marks a pivotal entry into the rapidly growing Web3 automation space. Otomato's platform is designed to simplify blockchain development for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders by allowing them to automate on-chain actions in response to off-chain events. This innovation addresses a critical need in the DeFi sector for accessible, automated strategies and has garnered substantial interest from the industry, signalling significant potential for rapid growth.

Coinsilium holds a USD75,000 stake in Otomato, with an option to acquire an additional USD150,000 in future tokens, making it a key early-stage backer of this promising project. More importantly, Coinsilium is set to benefit from 7.5% of Otomato.xyz's revenues from launch until the Token Listing Event, expected in 2025. As revenues are anticipated to begin when the platform goes live in Q4 2024, this represents a near-term catalyst for Coinsilium's growth, providing a direct avenue for early-stage revenue generation.

Otomato is on an accelerated development timeline, with its public launch slated for Q4 2024. These will pave the way for Otomato to start generating affiliate and transaction fees as early as this year. The project is gaining considerable industry traction, as demonstrated by its participation in the MODE Yield Accelerator and the strong engagement of early testers during the beta phase. With over 2,150 followers and an active community, the platform is poised to rapidly expand its user base and establish a foothold in the burgeoning DeFi market.

Given the strong interest from the DeFi sector and the speed of Otomato's development, Coinsilium is optimistic about its potential for significant long-term value creation. The upcoming platform launch, and the eventual Token Listing Event will be critical milestones, and we look forward to providing regular updates as Otomato continues its fast-paced growth. Shareholders are encouraged to follow Otomato closely, since the project is advancing more quickly than expected, driven by high levels of interest from the DeFi community.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we move into what looks to be a more favourable and positive environment for the cryptocurrency market, there is much to look forward to for Coinsilium and its shareholders. With Bitcoin's strengthening market position and the expectation of further liquidity entering the market, the conditions are aligning for significant opportunities across the broader blockchain and Web3 sectors.

Coinsilium is now well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, thanks to the work undertaken over the last two years to strategically build and expand our investment and advisory operations. Our efforts have ensured that we are prepared to leverage the upcoming bull market, with our projects and partnerships fully aligned to drive growth. We are confident that this groundwork sets the stage for both short and medium term value generation while laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

Finally, the Board would like to express its sincere gratitude to our valued shareholders, partners, and team members for their continued support. With signs of favourable market conditions persisting, evidenced by the continual improvement in cryptocurrency markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on the ongoing developments and news from our existing portfolio of investments and advisory projects, which we believe will demonstrate significant progress throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2024 | Company Announcement | Investegate,http://www.investegate.co.uk/announcement/eqs/coinsilium-group-limited--coin/coinsilium-group-limited-unaudited-consolida-/8444925,2024-09-27,investegate.co.uk,"UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Coinsilium Group Limited (""Coinsilium"" or the ""Company""), the Web3 investor, advisor, and venture builder, is pleased to announce its unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2024.

The Directors of Coinsilium Group Limited take responsibility for this announcement.

The Company ended the period under review with over £0.4m cash at bank and £1.1m in other current assets including Cryptocurrencies, tokens and rights to future tokens.

The digital asset markets have recovered significantly since the start of the reporting period, which has had a markedly positive impact on the Company's cryptocurrency holdings as the profit from continuing operations increased to £29,545 from a loss of £104,247 in H1 2023.

Throughout the period, Coinsilium continued to make solid operational progress across its investment and advisory activities, and we are pleased to provide details of developments and significant news released to the market during the reporting period:

On 29 January 2024, the Company provided an update regarding its investee, Web3 development company Indorse Pte. Ltd. (""Indorse""), and the ongoing collaboration with Indorse on the 'Byzant Web3 Social Network Ecosystem' (""the Collaboration""). The primary focus of this collaboration has been on the development of a range of Web3 applications. One such application, the Bastion Wallet was launched in August 2023 and enables both seasoned crypto users and newcomers to seamlessly interact with Web3 applications.

Additionally, Indorse's technical team has been working closely with A-ADS one of the longest-established and largest crypto and Bitcoin advertising networks, to develop Adbazaar, a decentralised advertising platform tailored for Web3 advertisers and publishers.

The involvement of A-ADS, whose core team brings 13 years of experience in crypto-based advertising, alongside Coinsilium and Indorse, reinforces the depth of expertise driving the development of the Byzant Web3 Ecosystem.

Web3 advertising presents a highly promising but still underdeveloped opportunity compared to its well-established role as a revenue driver in Web2 social media. Coinsilium views early movers in the Web3 advertising space, such as Adbazaar, as being well-positioned to capitalise on this emerging market. While Adbazaar is still in its development phase, the project holds significant potential to leverage early entry into the Web3 advertising landscape. Backed by industry veterans like A-ADS, the project aims to position itself as a competitive player, ready to capitalise on the nascent revenue opportunities in this sector.

Throughout the period, Adbazaar has been the primary focus for the Collaboration, due to its clearer path toward commercialisation and potential to generate early revenues. As the project gains traction in the Web3 advertising market, it will provide a solid foundation for developing the additional applications within the Byzant ecosystem. This approach allows us to focus on more immediate opportunities, while the broader range of applications will be prioritised once Adbazaar is fully refined and ready for launch.

Managing these steps carefully is essential for ensuring long-term scalability and success. The latest version of the Adbazaar platform is currently being tested by A-ADS, marking a key milestone in this strategy.

Coinsilium holds an equity investment in Greengage Global Holding Limited (""Greengage""). Greengage's core business activity centres on providing distributed e-money account services through partnerships with regulated payments-as-a-service firms, tailored to entrepreneurs, SMEs, family offices, and digital asset firms. Greengage offers its clients personal and business e-money accounts in over 50 currencies, including GBP, EUR, and USD. Clients benefit from 24/7 account access and a dedicated relationship manager for personalised support. The services include faster payments, CHAPS, and SEPA payment services, with access to SWIFT payments and Foreign Exchange (FX) depending on the chosen regulated partner provider.

Greengage also provides value-added services through a network of third-party providers. One such service is B2B loans, with the platform facilitating over a quarter of a billion USD in lending since its inception. An example of an innovative product is lending in fiat against tradable cryptocurrencies on a non-recourse basis to provide growth capital, alongside other unique financial solutions.

During the period Greengage notified Coinsilium that it has signed an agreement with a new regulated partner to bring forward the launch of its USD currency accounts (as well as several other currencies including CHF, SEK and CAD) along with FX and SWIFT payments for its clients.

This is significant news as there still remain very few ""crypto friendly"" payment providers offering USD accounts. Greengage management expect that this new agreement will both help to attract new clients for their services as well as strengthen their existing client relationships. Greengage also advised that they continue to maintain a healthy pipeline for new account opening submissions.

Post Period Developments

On 5 July 2024 Greengage announced news of a new collaboration with global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to originate SME debt on the Coinbase Diamond Protocol. This collaboration seeks to utilise blockchain technology to provide SMEs with access to capital, promising a more efficient and transparent financing solution. The Coinbase Diamond protocol enhances the issuance and management of private capital. Using blockchain technology, the protocol issues native digital debt, making the process more secure and accessible to a broader range of investors.

In early September Greengage announced that it has been selected from over 1,228 applications to join 20 other startups in Hub71's 15th cohort in Abu Dhabi, as part of the Hub71+ Digital Assets program. At the same time, Greengage announced that it has established its first office in Abu Dhabi from where it aims to scale and grow its operations within this global tech hub.

Further information on Greengage is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Coindash's main product is the SSV Network. Ssv.network is a fully decentralized, open-source ETH staking network, based on Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology. Ethereum validators are required to stake 32 ETH and operate a software validator client alongside legacy and Beacon Chain nodes. This process introduces complexity, especially as the creation of a validator results in a crucial Validator Key responsible for transaction signing. SSV Network addresses this complexity, enhancing validator key security, and delivering benefits to the broader Ethereum network, staking pools, services, and individual stakers.

As of 31 December 2023, the price of the SSV token stood at $6.83 per token. By 30 June 2024 at the end of the reporting period, the token price had increased to $36.09, with a peak of $61.30 per token recorded on 26 March 2024 with a fully diluted market capitalization for the total supply of SSV tokens at US$713.4 million.

Given the substantial SSV token holdings in Coindash's cryptocurrency treasury and the significant price appreciation of SSV tokens throughout the reporting period, the Company has determined to revalue its interest in Coindash. This decision is grounded in the material increase in the value of Coindash's liquid SSV holdings, and the revaluation is applied pro-rata to the Company's stake in Coindash.

While the price of the SSV token experienced a significant increase of 528% over the reporting period, the Company's revalued its stake in Coindash by 346%, adjusted to reflect the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) performance of the SSV token. This adjustment takes into account the fluctuations in SSV tokens market liquidity and its overall trading volume during the period.

Coinsilium holds a convertible loan and option interest in Silta. During the period, Silta notified Coinsilium that it had received an investment from a top 10 global infrastructure development bank (""Bank"") as part of a strategic partnership agreement to build a climate financing marketplace, powered by AI, for bankability and sustainability assessments. This strategic partnership aims to help support governments, infrastructure developers, and financial institutions to reach their goals of deploying US$800B towards Climate Financing by 2030. Silta's strategic partnership with the Bank aims to create the benchmark for climate financing due diligence, thereby unlocking an US$800B opportunity within Asian markets, opening the door to a US$1.3T global market for projects driving the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.

Post Period Developments

In a recent update Silta advised its shareholders that is has been building on its work over the last 8 month and is now working on a contract extension with a global bank to continue the development of its white-label solution as they prepare to go into production-grade and publicly launch the platform.

On 14 September 2023 Coinsilium announced that Seedcoin, its 100% owned Gibraltar subsidiary, had signed a Convertible Loan Agreement and Option Agreement with Silta as a cornerstone investor in their funding round. The Convertible Loan Agreement provided a loan principal amount of USD50,000 at a pre-money valuation of USD5m. The loan was granted for a period of six months, converting at maturity into 22,306 new common shares of Silta at a price of USD 2.2416 per share.

As at the time of this report we note that there has been a delay in the issuance of the new shares, and it is expected that the new shares will be issued to Coinsilium within the coming weeks. The Option Agreement for up to USD500,000 provides the rights to subscribe to up to 163,575 new shares in Silta at a pre-money valuation of USD7.5m valid for 12 months from 8 September 2023.

An addendum to the Option Agreement was executed on 16 September 2024 whereby the parties agreed on an extension of the Long-Stop Date by 6 months which effectively means that the Option Agreement will now be valid till 7 March 2025.

Coinsilium holds a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (""SAFT"") in Yellow Network, a Layer-3 decentralised Broker Clearing Network powered by State Channels used for communicating and trading between brokers and aggregating liquidity of connected nodes. Exchanges, brokers, and trading firms connect to the P2P network using a unified communication protocol. The main target of Yellow Network is to interconnect all blockchains unlocking access to liquidity for truly decentralised, cross-chain and ultra-high-speed trading. The Yellow Network public launch and token listing is slated for Q4 2024. The token listing is a critical milestone since, once tokens are issued and listed on an exchange, this will provide for a mark-to-market valuation reference point for Coinsilium's investment and potential liquidity event subject to vesting terms.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens, vesting over a period of time. At this stage the Company cannot disclose specific details regarding price or number of Tokens to be received. Further details will be provided by way of an update to the market in due course, when the Company is able to do so.

Post Period Developments

On 18 September 2024 Yellow Network announced that it had closed a US$10 million seed round led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and other notable investors including leading Ethereum developer Consensys, crypto market-making and trading firm GSR and crypto native VC firm Moonrock Capital. The Yellow Network public launch and token listing is slated for Q4 2024.

Coinsilium holds a SAFT in GGs.io, as announced on 22 June 2022. GGs.io serves as a gateway to the Latin American (LatAm) market for AAA and Web3 game studios and is currently in the process of establishing a gaming-focused fund aimed at acquiring and managing digital assets in the gaming sector. Over recent months, GGs.io has entered into SAFTs and agreements with reputable Web3 gaming studios, acquiring tokens for Web3 games that they believe have the potential to become market leaders within their respective genres.

GGs.io's investment strategy is focused on acquiring tokens from what they identify as the top 1% of games, particularly from studios that succeed in replicating or improving upon existing Web2 game franchises. The Directors of Coinsilium believe that the GGs.io team possesses the expertise needed to identify future leaders in the Web3 gaming space, drawing on their experience with titles such as League of Kingdoms, Champions Ascension, FTW by Jungle, Off the Grid, RavenQuest, and Gunzilla.

GGs.io has advised Coinsilium that it will continue to support gaming studios with LatAm market expansion, particularly those issuing tokens to be held by their future gaming fund. Alongside Coinsilium, other notable investors in GGs.io include Orange DAO, Boost VC, Ripio, and strategic angels from the BAYC community and the entertainment industry.

Ember Sword is a modern MMORPG crafted by veterans of both the gaming industry and competitive gaming, from world champions to e-sports legends.

The team behind Ember Sword has been a part of creating some of the biggest games in the world: AION, Cyberpunk 2077, Diablo 3, Guild Wars, Hitman 1/2/3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, League of Legends, Mafia: Trilogy, Star Wars: Galaxies, The Witcher 2/3, Titan Quest, Valorant, World of Tanks, World of Warcraft.

During the period, the Company acquired an unspecified number Ember tokens via a SAFT with a linear vesting token distribution which will complete by August 2025.

On 8 March 2024, Coinsilium announced a strategic financing done via a combination of a placing and subscription, raised £472,500 through the issue of 18,900,000 new ordinary shares of no-par value (""Ordinary Shares"") in the Company at an issue price of 2.5p per share (""Financing Shares""). Included within the Financing, Malcolm Palle (Executive Chairman) and Eddy Travia (Chief Executive Officer) participated with a subscription of £40,000 in total. In addition, 3,356,000 Ordinary Shares were issued on the same terms as the Financing Shares for payments totalling £83,900 in respect of a broad range of business support, marketing and communications services, designed primarily to broaden awareness of the Company's value proposition and attract a wider range of on-market investors (""Service Shares""). Each Financing Share and Service Share included an attaching warrant to subscribe for a further new ordinary share at an exercise price of 3.75p and with a life to expiry of 3 years from Admission to trading of the new Ordinary Shares, pursuant to the Financing (in total 22,256,000 ""Financing and Service Warrants""). The Financing underpins the Company's working capital position and importantly, enables an acceleration of certain operational and investing activities at a time when AI and Web3 are rapidly advancing and Coinsilium wishes to remain at the forefront of various Web3 technology initiatives.

On 20 February 2024 Coinsilium announced it had signed an agreement with global trade exchange platform LC Lite (""LC Lite"") for strategic advisory services in respect of the forthcoming token launch. LC Lite was recently acquired by Incomlend, a regulated global invoice finance marketplace for SMEs with licenses to operate in Singapore and in Hong Kong. LC Lite aims to bring Web3 decentralised technology to Incomlend, with improved marketplace liquidity, multi-currency solutions for cross-border export financing and a broad usage of stablecoins. The project has since been rebranded and launched as NEXADE and is well positioned to capitalise on emerging business opportunities from within the fast-growing digital asset market.

The scope of the work undertaken by Coinsilium includes advising LC Lite on its project token economics (Tokenomics) ahead of its planned token launch, slated for Q4 2024. Additionally, Coinsilium is facilitating introductions for LC Lite to potential partners drawn from Coinsilium's extensive network of major service providers and cryptocurrency firms. Advisory service terms pertaining to advisory engagements are commercially sensitive and subject to mutual confidentiality agreements. Typically, an agreement will include a 'sign on' payment and a final success payment. The success payment will usually be a fixed fee, denominated in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum or in project digital tokens and will be payable on the successful completion of a project's Token Generating Event (""TGE"").

Further information on NEXADE is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

On 3 April 2024 Coinsilium announced the launch of a new series of Web3 industry reports. These reports aim to provide investors with a greater understanding of the emerging Web3 space, offering insights into the applications, use cases, and the blockchain technology underpinning it. The reports also feature some of the projects that make up Coinsilium's investment and advisory services portfolio. To-date we have produced seven reports, all of which are available for download from a dedicated section on the Coinsilium website: https://www.coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

On 2 July 2024 Coinsilium announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MoU"") with Liteflow, Inc (""Liteflow""), an experienced Web3 and NFT technical developer.

SAFT to acquire Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol Tokens

On 3 July 2024 Consilium announced that it had entered into a SAFT with the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol. Otomato is designed to simplify interactions with DeFi platforms through automation and user-friendly interfaces. It can help bridge the gap for DeFi traders without coding skills by automating complex tasks and providing clear, intuitive guides.

Otomato.xyz is the first decentralised application of the Protocol and enables De-Fi traders to create and automate their own Web3 trading strategies as a succession of on-chain actions which can integrate reactions to off-chain events. User control and security on the platform are ensured through account abstraction (ERC-4337), making blockchain automation accessible and efficient for all users.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD75,000 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Early Backers' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. Coinsilium also has the option to acquire an additional USD150,150 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Strategic' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. In addition, Coinsilium will earn 7.5% of revenues generated by the Otomato.xyz platform up to the time of the Token Listing Event, anticipated to occur during 2025.

Revenues will be predominantly derived from affiliate fees from actions executed through integrated protocols and fees from transactions initiated via the Otomato.xyz platform. The public launch of the platform is expected by Q4 2024, when revenues would be expected to commence.

Elevate Health has progressed in its transformation into a decentralised science (DeSci) project, focusing on creating a platform that rewards members for contributing and accessing data, research, and treatments in preventative healthcare.

The project is currently in discussions with a prominent, yet undisclosed, decentralised launchpad, which has raised approximately $1 billion for various token projects over the past three years. It is noteworthy that DeSci-related tokens have shown strong post-launch performance compared to other sectors.

Elevate Health has advised Coinsilium that it is targeting a potential token issuance by the end of 2024. Further updates will be provided to the market as and when available.

StartupToken has successfully transitioned its business model to focus on Web3 Real World Asset (""RWA"") tokenization, with an initial emphasis on the Bali real estate market.

The company's flagship application, Propex, is now in the advanced stages of development. Propex is designed to streamline the transaction of real estate assets by bringing ownership transfers onto the blockchain. This aims to automate and simplify the process for property owners and their counterparties by tokenizing property contracts into unique, programmable assets (NFTs). These NFTs can be used for various Web3 applications, such as trading, collateralized loans, and more. Propex offers real estate agents and notaries a minting service to create on-chain proof of ownership, while maintaining the existing system of record. The blockchain-based records serve as tamper-proof, verified copies that co-exist with the traditional system until full adoption of on-chain processes. While the initial market focus is on Bali, Indonesia, the Propex solution has potential applications in other regions beyond this initial market.

The Arcadian Youth team recently updated the Company, reporting that the first development stage of the blockchain-based application has been completed. In this initial phase, the application allows users to mint 'location NFTs,' enabling them to participate in challenges and earn points. The second stage will introduce the ability for property owners to mint their real estate NFTs, with notary verification, unlocking access to decentralised finance (DeFi) and RWA exchange platforms.

Additionally, the team informed us that their application for a grant from Lisk, a Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum and part of the Optimism Superchain, was successful. Lisk is focused on providing solutions for emerging markets through the tokenization of RWAs, which aligns well with Propex's goals.

We will continue to update the market with news and developments regarding Propex as the project progresses.

The following Trades were transacted on market by Directors

On 23 August 2024 Coinsilium announced it agreed to issue 600,000 new ordinary shares of no-par value in the Company at an issue price of 2.5p per share in lieu of fees incurred to the value of £15,000 (""Service Shares""). Each Service Share has an attaching warrant to subscribe for a further new ordinary share at an exercise price of 3.75p and with a life to expiry of 3 years from Admission to trading of the new Service Shares. The Service Shares and attaching one warrant for one ordinary share were issued on the same terms as the Company's most recent financing, announced 8 March 2024.

Bitcoin's sharp rise throughout the period in review, culminating in a new all-time high prior to the May 'halving' event, diverged from historic cycles, where such peaks are usually observed after the halving.

This early surge fuelled a degree of overexuberance, which in turn contributed to significant price fluctuations and heightened volatility post period to date, albeit that Bitcoin is now trading at significantly higher price levels than it was during the reporting period.

The recent volatility in the market has ultimately strengthened Bitcoin's position in the hands of longer-term holders, setting the stage for a more resilient recovery, which we are now beginning to witness.

The recent 50 basis point interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in four years, combined with the expectation of increased market liquidity, bolsters our confidence that a recovery in the crypto markets is well underway. We anticipate this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, with 2025 expected to bring even greater strength to the market which in turn should create a more favourable environment for investment and growth across the broader sector.

Coinsilium's efforts over the past two years, to strategically position itself for this anticipated positive market phase, are now starting to bear fruit. During this period, we have focused on expanding and scaling our advisory services capabilities, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the expected bull market in the Web3 sector. Our structured approach not only drives forward key strategic initiatives but also lays a strong foundation for both short and medium-term value generation. Most importantly, these efforts set the stage for sustained long-term growth as we continue to leverage our expertise and strategic positioning in this rapidly evolving market.

Anticipated Yellow Token Launch and Listing in Q4 2024

A key catalyst for Coinsilium, expected in Q4 2024, is the upcoming token launch and listing of the Yellow token. As announced 21 April 2022, Coinsilium entered into a US$200,000 Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) in Yellow. Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens in this early funding round, vesting over a period of time. The token launch will mark an important liquidity event for the Company, signalling the fruition of a long-term strategic investment.

Yellow Network recently announced that it had secured $10 million in funding, led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This strategic investment comes as Yellow's market valuation reportedly reaches over US$200m, positioning Yellow as a frontrunner in the DeFi trading revolution. Other notable backers and supporters include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. This funding round also highlights the growing confidence in Yellow Network's potential to address key inefficiencies in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, such as liquidity fragmentation and scalability.

With the launch of the Yellow token, Coinsilium will stand to benefit not only from a significant liquidity event but also from the enhanced visibility and market traction Yellow is expected to gain as a result of this strong backing. The involvement of high-profile investors like Chris Larsen further strengthens the case for Yellow's long-term success, which aligns well with Coinsilium's strategic vision.

Investors are encouraged to monitor this event closely, as it not only validates Coinsilium's early-stage investment strategy but also presents a promising opportunity for growth and value realisation.

Yellow is a highly ambitious project, aiming to address key inefficiencies in the DeFi space. Should Yellow meet its objectives, it has the potential to become a key player in the decentralised clearing space, backed by strong investment, experienced partners, and a clear vision.

Further information on Yellow is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Strategic Partnership with Liteflow Driving Web3 Innovation

Following the announcement of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liteflow on 2nd July 2024, we are pleased to report that this strategic collaboration is already showing significant promise. The initiative, which offers US$1 million in dedicated seed funding for early-stage Web3 startups, has attracted strong interest from high-quality applicants within DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi sectors. The creation of an Investment Committee as part of the process, composed of both companies and certain pre-approved co-investors, further strengthens this initiative, by ensuring a rigorous procedure for the assessment and selection of projects.

The initiative also integrates Coinsilium's advisory services as a key part of the same offering. This means that, in addition to investment opportunities, we are able to provide fee-generating advisory services to promising projects, even when we do not make direct investments. The combination of financial backing and strategic advisory capabilities strengthens our ability to support high-potential startups in the Web3 space, while also creating a significant revenue stream for the Company.

The first Web3 Start-Up Pitch Day, held on 30 July 2024, attracted a strong pool of high-quality projects, reflecting a strong interest in the initiative. These pitch days are designed to vet projects from both an investment and advisory perspective, allowing us to be selective in the clients we work with. As we look forward to the next pitch day on 2 October 2024, we are confident this initiative will provide us with a strong pipeline of high-potential startup candidates for both investment and advisory services.

This collaboration with Liteflow strengthens our position in the Web3 market and underpins the long-term growth prospects of our advisory services division, which is expected to play a key role in driving Coinsilium's future revenue streams.

Otomato: A High-Potential, Fast-Accelerating Project with Near-Term Growth Catalysts

Coinsilium's recent investment in Otomato, secured via a SAFT, marks a pivotal entry into the rapidly growing Web3 automation space. Otomato's platform is designed to simplify blockchain development for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders by allowing them to automate on-chain actions in response to off-chain events. This innovation addresses a critical need in the DeFi sector for accessible, automated strategies and has garnered substantial interest from the industry, signalling significant potential for rapid growth.

Coinsilium holds a $75,000 stake in Otomato, with an option to acquire an additional $150,000 in future tokens, making it a key early-stage backer of this promising project. More importantly, Coinsilium is set to benefit from 7.5% of Otomato.xyz's revenues from launch until the Token Listing Event, expected in 2025. As revenues are anticipated to begin when the platform goes live in Q4 2024, this represents a near-term catalyst for Coinsilium's growth, providing a direct avenue for early-stage revenue generation.

Otomato is on an accelerated development timeline, with its public launch slated for Q4 2024. These will pave the way for Otomato to start generating affiliate and transaction fees as early as this year. The project is gaining considerable industry traction, as demonstrated by its participation in the MODE Yield Accelerator and the strong engagement of early testers during the beta phase. With over 2,150 followers and an active community, the platform is poised to rapidly expand its user base and establish a foothold in the burgeoning DeFi market.

Given the strong interest from the DeFi sector and the speed of Otomato's development, Coinsilium is optimistic about its potential for significant long-term value creation. The upcoming platform launch, and the eventual Token Listing Event will be critical milestones, and we look forward to providing regular updates as Otomato continues its fast-paced growth. Shareholders are encouraged to follow Otomato closely, since the project is advancing more quickly than expected, driven by high levels of interest from the DeFi community.

With Bitcoin's strengthening market position and the expectation of further liquidity entering the market, the conditions are aligning for significant opportunities across the broader blockchain and Web3 sectors.

Coinsilium is now well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, thanks to the work undertaken over the last two years to strategically build and expand our investment and advisory operations. Our efforts have ensured that we are prepared to leverage the upcoming bull market, with our projects and partnerships fully aligned to drive growth. We are confident that this groundwork sets the stage for both short and medium term value generation while laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

Finally, the Board would like to express its sincere gratitude to our valued shareholders, partners, and team members for their continued support. With signs of favourable market conditions persisting, evidenced by the continual improvement in cryptocurrency markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on the ongoing developments and news from our existing portfolio of investments and advisory projects, which we believe will demonstrate significant progress throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

The platform is licensed and regulated, which adds another layer of confidence for those of you who are concerned about fairness and security.

However, for Bitcoin users and those of you who stick with the more mainstream cryptos, BetPanda offers a delightful and highly functional gaming experience.

In conclusion, BetPanda is a fun, secure, and rewarding Bitcoin casino that manages to balance its playful design with serious gaming options. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the world of crypto gambling, BetPanda provides a welcoming environment with fast transactions, exciting games, and generous bonuses.

When it comes to choosing crypto casinos, we take a comprehensive approach to evaluating every aspect of the platform. Our team of experts looks at a variety of factors to ensure that you all have a smooth, safe, and enjoyable experience at your favorite crypto casino sites. Each bitcoin casino is rated based on a number of key factors that help determine whether they deserve a spot among the best crypto casinos.

Bonuses are one of the first things you should consider when joining a new bitcoin casino. Our ratings give special weight to the types of bonuses offered, such as free spins, deposit matches, and ongoing promotions. The best crypto casino promotions offer a mix of welcome bonuses and ongoing deals to keep you playing and winning. We also take into account the wagering requirements, as these can greatly affect the value of a bonus.

The variety of casino games is another critical factor in our ratings. Most crypto casinos offer a wide range of games, from popular slots to table games like blackjack and roulette. We also check for live dealer games and provably fair games, which are a big draw for crypto gambling enthusiasts. Additionally, having options for sports betting adds to the overall appeal, giving players more ways to enjoy their time on bitcoin casino sites.

One of the main advantages of crypto casinos is the speed and convenience of their payment methods. Our team evaluates how quickly you can deposit and withdraw funds at each bitcoin casino. Whether you're using Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash, the best crypto casinos should offer fast transaction times with minimal fees. We also look at the variety of supported cryptocurrencies and the overall ease of use when managing your funds.

Safety is always a priority, especially when dealing with online gambling. We carefully review each crypto casino's security protocols, including encryption, privacy policies, and licensing information. Provably fair games are another important factor we assess, as they ensure that games are not rigged, giving players peace of mind. Only the most trusted bitcoin casinos make it onto our list, and we always recommend you choose a platform with strong customer support to help resolve any issues quickly.

Customer support plays a significant role in the overall experience at a crypto casino. Whether it's handling a payment issue or clarifying bonus terms, responsive customer service is essential. We look for platforms that offer 24/7 live chat, email support, and detailed FAQ sections to ensure you get help when you need it. The top crypto casino platforms make it easy to reach support through multiple channels.

If you're debating whether to play at a bitcoin casino or a traditional online casino, there are several key differences that may help sway your decision. Both offer a wide variety of casino games, including slots, table games, and sports betting, but bitcoin casino sites come with unique advantages that traditional casinos simply can't match.

One of the major benefits of bitcoin casinos is the speed of deposits and withdrawals. In a traditional online gambling platform, you might wait days for a bank transfer or credit card withdrawal. Bitcoin casinos, on the other hand, offer near-instant transaction times. Whether you're using Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash, crypto casino sites typically process transactions within minutes, which means you can start playing sooner and cash out quickly when you win.

Another reason many of you prefer bitcoin casinos over traditional platforms is the privacy and anonymity they provide. While traditional casinos often require extensive personal information and KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, most crypto casino registrations only require a basic email address to get started. This added layer of privacy is particularly appealing if you're concerned about sharing sensitive information online.

One feature unique to crypto casinos is the availability of provably fair games. FIAT online casinos require you to trust that their games are fair, but bitcoin casinos often provide a provably fair system that allows players to verify the fairness of each game. This transparency is a huge advantage for those of you looking for an extra layer of trust in your gaming experience.

When comparing the bonuses offered at bitcoin casinos versus traditional casinos, you'll often find that the best bitcoin and crypto casinos are more generous. Many crypto casinos offer large welcome bonuses, deposit matches, and free spins to entice new players. These bonuses typically come with lower wagering requirements compared to traditional online casino bonuses, making them easier to convert into real winnings.

Lastly, bitcoin casinos are more accessible for players around the world, especially in regions where online casino business may face regulatory restrictions. With cryptocurrency, you all can bypass many of the limitations imposed by local banking systems, giving you access to a wider range of gaming options.

The variety of casino games you all can enjoy at crypto casinos is one of the biggest draws of these platforms. From classic slot games to modern live dealer experiences, bitcoin casino sites offer something for everyone. The best crypto casinos partner with top software developers to deliver a seamless gaming experience across all devices.

Slots are by far the most popular choice at any online casino, and crypto casinos are no exception. With hundreds, if not thousands, of online slots to choose from, you'll find everything from simple 3-reel classics to intricate 5-reel video slots with engaging themes and bonus features. Many crypto casinos offer free spins as part of their welcome bonuses, giving you the chance to try out new slots without risking your own funds.

For those of you who enjoy the classics, table games like blackjack, roulette, and poker are always available at the best bitcoin and crypto casinos. Whether you prefer traditional versions or more modern twists, you'll find plenty of options to suit your playstyle. Bitcoin casinos also offer live dealer games, which bring the excitement of a real casino directly to your screen.

One unique feature of bitcoin casinos is the availability of provably fair games. These games use cryptographic algorithms to ensure that the outcome is completely random and cannot be manipulated by the casino. This level of transparency is especially important for those of you who value fairness and want to know that you're getting a legitimate gaming experience.

In addition to casino games, a crypto casino can also offer sports betting options. You can wager on everything from football and basketball to eSports and horse racing. The best crypto casinos will provide competitive odds and a wide range of markets, making it easy for you to place your bets in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

One of the key reasons why many of you prefer bitcoin casinos is the speed of deposits and withdrawals. Unlike regular fiat casinos that may take days to process payments, crypto casino sites excel in offering near-instant transactions.

With crypto casinos, your funds are typically available within minutes of making a deposit. The decentralized nature of these cryptocurrencies ensures that transactions are processed quickly, allowing you to dive into your favorite casino games almost immediately. This is a huge advantage for players who want to start playing without delay.

When it comes to withdrawing your winnings, bitcoin casinos outperform fiat casinos by a significant margin. Instead of waiting days for a withdrawal to hit your bank account, you can receive your funds within minutes or hours at a crypto casino. This speed is especially important for those of you who enjoy the convenience of quick access to your funds.

Another benefit of using bitcoin casinos is the lower transaction fees. Regular online casinos often charge fees for deposits and withdrawals, especially when using credit cards or bank transfers. Crypto casinos, on the other hand, usually offer very low or even zero fees for transactions, making it more cost-effective for players.

When it comes to crypto casinos, one of the biggest draws is the variety of bonuses and promotions offered to players. Unlike FIAT online casinos, crypto gambling sites often offer larger, more exciting bonuses to attract and retain crypto gamblers. These bonuses can come in many forms, from deposit matches and free spins to cashback offers and VIP perks, all designed to give you more value for your cryptocurrency deposits.

The most common type of bonus you'll find at crypto casinos is the welcome bonus, which is typically offered to new players when they sign up and make their first deposit. Crypto casinos often provide generous welcome bonuses that can significantly boost your initial bankroll. For example, many brands will offer a 100% deposit match, meaning that whatever amount you deposit (up to a specified limit) will be doubled in bonus funds. Some crypto casinos even go beyond this, offering 200% or 300% match bonuses to really give you a head start.

In addition to the deposit match, many welcome bonuses also come with free spins, especially for slot games. These free spins give you a chance to try out popular slot games without using your own funds, and any winnings from the free spins may either be credited as bonus money or sometimes as withdrawable cash, depending on the casino's terms and conditions.

It's important to read the fine print when it comes to welcome bonuses, though. The best sites on our list will have reasonable wagering requirements, which dictate how many times you need to play through the bonus amount before you can withdraw any winnings. Some crypto casinos might have higher wagering requirements, so it's always a good idea to check before committing.

Beyond the initial welcome offer, crypto casinos continue to reward loyal players through a variety of ongoing promotions. These promotions often include reload bonuses, which work similarly to welcome bonuses but are available on subsequent deposits. This is a great way to keep your bankroll topped up after your initial play.

Another popular type of ongoing promotion at these sites is cashback offers. With cashback, you can receive a percentage of your losses back over a certain period, usually on a weekly or monthly basis. For instance, a crypto casino might offer a 10% cashback bonus on your net losses for the week. This type of bonus is particularly appealing because it acts as a safety net, ensuring that even if you hit a losing streak, you still get some value back.

For those of you who enjoy slots, free spins are a common and much-loved promotion at most crypto casinos. These free spins are often part of larger promotions tied to specific games or events, giving you the chance to play without risking your own funds. Some of the best bitcoin casino sites offer free spins as a standalone promotion, while others might include them as part of their welcome or reload bonuses.

Additionally, some of the best brands offer no-deposit bonuses, which allow you to start playing without making any deposit at all. These bonuses are rare, but they're highly sought after, as they give you the opportunity to win real money with zero risk. While no-deposit bonuses are usually smaller than deposit match offers, they provide an excellent opportunity to test out a casino's games and features without committing any funds.

Many crypto casino sites also have VIP or loyalty programs in place to reward long-term players. These programs usually work on a tiered system, where the more you play, the higher you climb in the ranks. The rewards you can receive from these programs are often exclusive and can include higher cashback percentages, exclusive bonuses, faster withdrawal times, and even personalized customer support.

For example, the best bitcoin casinos often offer players the chance to earn points every time they play, which can later be exchanged for bonus funds or other rewards. As you move up the VIP tiers, you may even unlock exclusive events or tournaments with larger prize pools.

It's essential to understand that most crypto bonuses come with wagering requirements. This is the number of times you need to wager your bonus funds before you can withdraw any winnings. For example, if you receive a $100 bonus with a 40x wagering requirement, you would need to wager $4,000 before you can cash out your winnings. The best brands offer reasonable wagering requirements, but it's crucial to review these terms before you claim a bonus to avoid any surprises.

One of the easiest ways to recognize a trusted online casino is by reviewing its terms and conditions. Reputable crypto casinos will clearly outline their rules for bonuses, withdrawals, and general gameplay. This transparency ensures that you all know exactly what you're signing up for and helps to avoid any unpleasant surprises when it comes time to cash out your winnings. Always check the wagering requirements on bonuses, particularly free spins, and make sure they are fair and achievable.

Another excellent way to gauge the trustworthiness of a Bitcoin casino is by checking what other players have to say. User reviews provide real-world insights into a casino's payment methods, customer support, and game selection. The best crypto casinos will have a solid reputation backed by positive feedback from players. If you see consistent complaints about delayed withdrawals, unresponsive support, or shady bonus terms, it's best to steer clear of that platform.

Top-tier sites will prioritize data security and player privacy. Look for casinos that use SSL encryption to protect your sensitive information, as this ensures that your personal data and transactions are secure. Additionally, the best bitcoin casinos should offer features like two-factor authentication (2FA) for added account protection. For those of you who prefer anonymity, check if the casino allows you to play without going through KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures -- many crypto casinos still offer this option.

When it comes to payments, the speed and reliability of payments are crucial factors in determining the trustworthiness of a crypto casino. The best crypto casino sites will allow you to deposit and withdraw using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and other popular cryptocurrencies, with minimal delays. Keep an eye out for casinos that process payments quickly -- especially for Bitcoin withdrawals, which should generally take no more than a few minutes to complete.

Starting your journey in the world of crypto gambling can feel daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, the experience is highly rewarding.

The best bitcoin and crypto casinos are designed to offer a smooth onboarding process for new players, but understanding how bitcoin casinos work is key to mastering the game.

When you make your first deposit using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, you'll notice the difference immediately -- transactions are processed almost instantly, and the security and anonymity offered by blockchain technology are unparalleled.

When you're new to an online crypto casino, you might be tempted to jump straight into popular slot games or table games like blackjack and roulette. While these are great options, it's important to understand that each game has different mechanics, odds, and strategies. Crypto casinos will offer provably fair games, which allow you to verify the fairness of each round. This is particularly useful if you're serious about mastering casino games and want to ensure you're getting a fair shake.

If you want to go from zero to hero in bitcoin casinos, make sure to take full advantage of the available bonuses. Many crypto casino sites offer lucrative welcome packages, including free spins, deposit matches, and even no-deposit bonuses. These promotions give you extra chances to win without risking much of your own money. Additionally, the best bitcoin casino sites will have ongoing promotions that reward loyalty -- so be sure to keep an eye out for reload bonuses, cashback offers, and special tournaments.

One of the most important steps in becoming a successful crypto gambler is managing your bankroll effectively. Set limits on how much you're willing to deposit, and don't chase losses. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum means your funds can fluctuate in value, so it's crucial to keep a close eye on your balance. Always play responsibly and ensure you're getting the most out of the bonuses and free spins offered by the Bitcoin online casinos.

As you gain experience, you'll become more comfortable navigating the sites and using cryptocurrencies for your transactions. The best Bitcoin casinos offer educational resources, such as guides on how to use Bitcoin, as well as tutorials on mastering various casino games. With time, you'll develop your strategies and might even explore advanced options like sports betting, which many top bitcoin casinos now offer alongside traditional games.

Before you dive into crypto gambling, it's essential to do your homework. While the best sites are reputable and offer great benefits, not every platform out there is trustworthy. Research each casino's reputation by reading reviews, checking their licensing, and reviewing their bonuses and promotions. Make sure the site offers fair games, fast payouts, and solid customer support.

One of the biggest advantages of playing at bitcoin casinos is the abundance of bonuses and free spins available to players. The crypto casinos on our list will offer generous welcome packages, including deposit matches and free spins on popular slots. These promotions give you an opportunity to build your bankroll without investing a lot of your own funds upfront. But be sure to read the terms and conditions -- some bonuses come with high wagering requirements that can make it difficult to cash out your winnings.

If fairness and transparency are priorities for you, then stick to provably fair games offered by most crypto casinos. These games allow you to verify the fairness of each spin, card dealt, or round completed. By choosing fair games, you ensure that the casino isn't manipulating the outcomes, giving you the confidence that you're getting a fair shot.

It's easy to get carried away when playing at BTC casinos, especially with fast transaction times and engaging games. That's why managing both your time and bankroll is key. Set limits on how much you're willing to deposit, and always have a stop-loss strategy in place. The best crypto casinos will allow you to set deposit limits, giving you more control over your spending.

Many of the best bitcoin casino sites have loyalty programs or VIP clubs that reward consistent play. These programs can provide excellent benefits, such as cashback on losses, faster withdrawal times, and exclusive bonuses. If you're planning on playing regularly, enrolling in a casino's VIP program can significantly enhance your experience and give you extra value for your deposits.

While slots are fun and often come with free spins, don't forget to try out other casino games like blackjack, poker, or even sports betting. Diversifying your gameplay can keep things exciting and offer you more ways to win. The best Bitcoin casinos often have extensive libraries of games, from live dealer experiences to cutting-edge table games, so take advantage of everything they offer.

Crypto casinos are known for their fast deposit and withdrawal speeds. Make sure to use a reliable cryptocurrency for your transactions. These payment methods offer near-instant payments, giving you more time to focus on playing your favorite casino games.

UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2024,https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/18536485-coinsilium-group-limited-unaudited-consolidated-interim-financial-statements-for-the-six-month-period-ended-30-june-2024,2024-09-27,wallstreet:online,"UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Coinsilium Group Limited (""Coinsilium"" or the ""Company""), the Web3 investor, advisor, and venture builder, is pleased to announce its unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2024.

The Directors of Coinsilium Group Limited take responsibility for this announcement.

The Company ended the period under review with over £0.4m cash at bank and £1.1m in other current assets including Cryptocurrencies, tokens and rights to future tokens.

The digital asset markets have recovered significantly since the start of the reporting period, which has had a markedly positive impact on the Company's cryptocurrency holdings as the profit from continuing operations increased to £29,545 from a loss of £104,247 in H1 2023.

Throughout the period, Coinsilium continued to make solid operational progress across its investment and advisory activities, and we are pleased to provide details of developments and significant news released to the market during the reporting period:

On 29 January 2024, the Company provided an update regarding its investee, Web3 development company Indorse Pte. Ltd. (""Indorse""), and the ongoing collaboration with Indorse on the 'Byzant Web3 Social Network Ecosystem' (""the Collaboration""). The primary focus of this collaboration has been on the development of a range of Web3 applications. One such application, the Bastion Wallet was launched in August 2023 and enables both seasoned crypto users and newcomers to seamlessly interact with Web3 applications.

Additionally, Indorse's technical team has been working closely with A-ADS one of the longest-established and largest crypto and Bitcoin advertising networks, to develop Adbazaar, a decentralised advertising platform tailored for Web3 advertisers and publishers.

The involvement of A-ADS, whose core team brings 13 years of experience in crypto-based advertising, alongside Coinsilium and Indorse, reinforces the depth of expertise driving the development of the Byzant Web3 Ecosystem.

Web3 advertising presents a highly promising but still underdeveloped opportunity compared to its well-established role as a revenue driver in Web2 social media. Coinsilium views early movers in the Web3 advertising space, such as Adbazaar, as being well-positioned to capitalise on this emerging market. While Adbazaar is still in its development phase, the project holds significant potential to leverage early entry into the Web3 advertising landscape. Backed by industry veterans like A-ADS, the project aims to position itself as a competitive player, ready to capitalise on the nascent revenue opportunities in this sector.

Throughout the period, Adbazaar has been the primary focus for the Collaboration, due to its clearer path toward commercialisation and potential to generate early revenues. As the project gains traction in the Web3 advertising market, it will provide a solid foundation for developing the additional applications within the Byzant ecosystem. This approach allows us to focus on more immediate opportunities, while the broader range of applications will be prioritised once Adbazaar is fully refined and ready for launch.

Managing these steps carefully is essential for ensuring long-term scalability and success. The latest version of the Adbazaar platform is currently being tested by A-ADS, marking a key milestone in this strategy.

Coinsilium holds an equity investment in Greengage Global Holding Limited (""Greengage""). Greengage's core business activity centres on providing distributed e-money account services through partnerships with regulated payments-as-a-service firms, tailored to entrepreneurs, SMEs, family offices, and digital asset firms. Greengage offers its clients personal and business e-money accounts in over 50 currencies, including GBP, EUR, and USD. Clients benefit from 24/7 account access and a dedicated relationship manager for personalised support. The services include faster payments, CHAPS, and SEPA payment services, with access to SWIFT payments and Foreign Exchange (FX) depending on the chosen regulated partner provider.

Greengage also provides value-added services through a network of third-party providers. One such service is B2B loans, with the platform facilitating over a quarter of a billion USD in lending since its inception. An example of an innovative product is lending in fiat against tradable cryptocurrencies on a non-recourse basis to provide growth capital, alongside other unique financial solutions.

During the period Greengage notified Coinsilium that it has signed an agreement with a new regulated partner to bring forward the launch of its USD currency accounts (as well as several other currencies including CHF, SEK and CAD) along with FX and SWIFT payments for its clients.

This is significant news as there still remain very few ""crypto friendly"" payment providers offering USD accounts. Greengage management expect that this new agreement will both help to attract new clients for their services as well as strengthen their existing client relationships. Greengage also advised that they continue to maintain a healthy pipeline for new account opening submissions.

Post Period Developments

On 5 July 2024 Greengage announced news of a new collaboration with global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to originate SME debt on the Coinbase Diamond Protocol. This collaboration seeks to utilise blockchain technology to provide SMEs with access to capital, promising a more efficient and transparent financing solution. The Coinbase Diamond protocol enhances the issuance and management of private capital. Using blockchain technology, the protocol issues native digital debt, making the process more secure and accessible to a broader range of investors.

In early September Greengage announced that it has been selected from over 1,228 applications to join 20 other startups in Hub71's 15th cohort in Abu Dhabi, as part of the Hub71+ Digital Assets program.

Coindash's main product is the SSV Network. Ssv.network is a fully decentralized, open-source ETH staking network, based on Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology. Ethereum validators are required to stake 32 ETH and operate a software validator client alongside legacy and Beacon Chain nodes. This process introduces complexity, especially as the creation of a validator results in a crucial Validator Key responsible for transaction signing. SSV Network addresses this complexity, enhancing validator key security, and delivering benefits to the broader Ethereum network, staking pools, services, and individual stakers.

As of 31 December 2023, the price of the SSV token stood at $6.83 per token. By 30 June 2024 at the end of the reporting period, the token price had increased to $36.09, with a peak of $61.30 per token recorded on 26 March 2024 with a fully diluted market capitalization for the total supply of SSV tokens at US$713.4 million.

Given the substantial SSV token holdings in Coindash's cryptocurrency treasury and the significant price appreciation of SSV tokens throughout the reporting period, the Company has determined to revalue its interest in Coindash. This decision is grounded in the material increase in the value of Coindash's liquid SSV holdings, and the revaluation is applied pro-rata to the Company's stake in Coindash.

While the price of the SSV token experienced a significant increase of 528% over the reporting period, the Company's revalued its stake in Coindash by 346%, adjusted to reflect the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) performance of the SSV token. This adjustment takes into account the fluctuations in SSV tokens market liquidity and its overall trading volume during the period.

Coinsilium holds a convertible loan and option interest in Silta. During the period, Silta notified Coinsilium that it had received an investment from a top 10 global infrastructure development bank (""Bank"") as part of a strategic partnership agreement to build a climate financing marketplace, powered by AI, for bankability and sustainability assessments. This strategic partnership aims to help support governments, infrastructure developers, and financial institutions to reach their goals of deploying US$800B towards Climate Financing by 2030. Silta's strategic partnership with the Bank aims to create the benchmark for climate financing due diligence, thereby unlocking an US$800B opportunity within Asian markets, opening the door to a US$1.3T global market for projects driving the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.

Post Period Developments

In a recent update Silta advised its shareholders that is has been building on its work over the last 8 month and is now working on a contract extension with a global bank to continue the development of its white-label solution as they prepare to go into production-grade and publicly launch the platform.

On 14 September 2023 Coinsilium announced that Seedcoin, its 100% owned Gibraltar subsidiary, had signed a Convertible Loan Agreement and Option Agreement with Silta as a cornerstone investor in their funding round. The Convertible Loan Agreement provided a loan principal amount of USD50,000 at a pre-money valuation of USD5m. The loan was granted for a period of six months, converting at maturity into 22,306 new common shares of Silta at a price of USD 2.2416 per share.

As at the time of this report we note that there has been a delay in the issuance of the new shares, and it is expected that the new shares will be issued to Coinsilium within the coming weeks. The Option Agreement for up to USD500,000 provides the rights to subscribe to up to 163,575 new shares in Silta at a pre-money valuation of USD7.5m valid for 12 months from 8 September 2023.

An addendum to the Option Agreement was executed on 16 September 2024 whereby the parties agreed on an extension of the Long-Stop Date by 6 months which effectively means that the Option Agreement will now be valid till 7 March 2025.

Coinsilium holds a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (""SAFT"") in Yellow Network, a Layer-3 decentralised Broker Clearing Network powered by State Channels used for communicating and trading between brokers and aggregating liquidity of connected nodes. Exchanges, brokers, and trading firms connect to the P2P network using a unified communication protocol. The main target of Yellow Network is to interconnect all blockchains unlocking access to liquidity for truly decentralised, cross-chain and ultra-high-speed trading. The Yellow Network public launch and token listing is slated for Q4 2024. The token listing is a critical milestone since, once tokens are issued and listed on an exchange, this will provide for a mark-to-market valuation reference point for Coinsilium's investment and potential liquidity event subject to vesting terms.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens, vesting over a period of time. At this stage the Company cannot disclose specific details regarding price or number of Tokens to be received. Further details will be provided by way of an update to the market in due course, when the Company is able to do so.

Included within the Financing, Malcolm Palle (Executive Chairman) and Eddy Travia (Chief Executive Officer) participated with a subscription of £40,000 in total. In addition, 3,356,000 Ordinary Shares were issued on the same terms as the Financing Shares for payments totalling £83,900 in respect of a broad range of business support, marketing and communications services, designed primarily to broaden awareness of the Company's value proposition and attract a wider range of on-market investors (""Service Shares""). Each Financing Share and Service Share included an attaching warrant to subscribe for a further new ordinary share at an exercise price of 3.75p and with a life to expiry of 3 years from Admission to trading of the new Ordinary Shares, pursuant to the Financing (in total 22,256,000 ""Financing and Service Warrants""). The Financing underpins the Company's working capital position and importantly, enables an acceleration of certain operational and investing activities at a time when AI and Web3 are rapidly advancing and Coinsilium wishes to remain at the forefront of various Web3 technology initiatives.

On 20 February 2024 Coinsilium announced it had signed an agreement with global trade exchange platform LC Lite (""LC Lite"") for strategic advisory services in respect of the forthcoming token launch. LC Lite was recently acquired by Incomlend, a regulated global invoice finance marketplace for SMEs with licenses to operate in Singapore and in Hong Kong. LC Lite aims to bring Web3 decentralised technology to Incomlend, with improved marketplace liquidity, multi-currency solutions for cross-border export financing and a broad usage of stablecoins.

Additionally, Coinsilium is facilitating introductions for LC Lite to potential partners drawn from Coinsilium's extensive network of major service providers and cryptocurrency firms. Advisory service terms pertaining to advisory engagements are commercially sensitive and subject to mutual confidentiality agreements. Typically, an agreement will include a 'sign on' payment and a final success payment. The success payment will usually be a fixed fee, denominated in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum or in project digital tokens and will be payable on the successful completion of a project's Token Generating Event (""TGE"").

SAFT to acquire Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol Tokens

On 3 July 2024 Consilium announced that it had entered into a SAFT with the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol. Otomato is designed to simplify interactions with DeFi platforms through automation and user-friendly interfaces. It can help bridge the gap for DeFi traders without coding skills by automating complex tasks and providing clear, intuitive guides.

Otomato.xyz is the first decentralised application of the Protocol and enables De-Fi traders to create and automate their own Web3 trading strategies as a succession of on-chain actions which can integrate reactions to off-chain events. User control and security on the platform are ensured through account abstraction (ERC-4337), making blockchain automation accessible and efficient for all users.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD75,000 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Early Backers' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. Coinsilium also has the option to acquire an additional USD150,150 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Strategic' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. In addition, Coinsilium will earn 7.5% of revenues generated by the Otomato.xyz platform up to the time of the Token Listing Event, anticipated to occur during 2025.

Revenues will be predominantly derived from affiliate fees from actions executed through integrated protocols and fees from transactions initiated via the Otomato.xyz platform. The public launch of the platform is expected by Q4 2024, when revenues would be expected to commence.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Elevate Health has progressed in its transformation into a decentralised science (DeSci) project, focusing on creating a platform that rewards members for contributing and accessing data, research, and treatments in preventative healthcare.

The project is currently in discussions with a prominent, yet undisclosed, decentralised launchpad, which has raised approximately $1 billion for various token projects over the past three years. It is noteworthy that DeSci-related tokens have shown strong post-launch performance compared to other sectors.

Elevate Health has advised Coinsilium that it is targeting a potential token issuance by the end of 2024. Further updates will be provided to the market as and when available.

StartupToken has successfully transitioned its business model to focus on Web3 Real World Asset (""RWA"") tokenization, with an initial emphasis on the Bali real estate market.

The company's flagship application, Propex, is now in the advanced stages of development. Propex is designed to streamline the transaction of real estate assets by bringing ownership transfers onto the blockchain. This aims to automate and simplify the process for property owners and their counterparties by tokenizing property contracts into unique, programmable assets (NFTs). These NFTs can be used for various Web3 applications, such as trading, collateralized loans, and more. Propex offers real estate agents and notaries a minting service to create on-chain proof of ownership, while maintaining the existing system of record. The blockchain-based records serve as tamper-proof, verified copies that co-exist with the traditional system until full adoption of on-chain processes. While the initial market focus is on Bali, Indonesia, the Propex solution has potential applications in other regions beyond this initial market.

The Arcadian Youth team recently updated the Company, reporting that the first development stage of the blockchain-based application has been completed. In this initial phase, the application allows users to mint 'location NFTs,' enabling them to participate in challenges and earn points. The second stage will introduce the ability for property owners to mint their real estate NFTs, with notary verification, unlocking access to decentralised finance (DeFi) and RWA exchange platforms.

Additionally, the team informed us that their application for a grant from Lisk, a Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum and part of the Optimism Superchain, was successful. Lisk is focused on providing solutions for emerging markets through the tokenization of RWAs, which aligns well with Propex's goals.

We will continue to update the market with news and developments regarding Propex as the project progresses.

The following Trades were transacted on market by Directors

On 23 August 2024 Coinsilium announced it agreed to issue 600,000 new ordinary shares of no-par value in the Company at an issue price of 2.5p per share in lieu of fees incurred to the value of £15,000 (""Service Shares""). Each Service Share has an attaching warrant to subscribe for a further new ordinary share at an exercise price of 3.75p and with a life to expiry of 3 years from Admission to trading of the new Service Shares. The Service Shares and attaching one warrant for one ordinary share were issued on the same terms as the Company's most recent financing, announced 8 March 2024.

Bitcoin's sharp rise throughout the period in review, culminating in a new all-time high prior to the May 'halving' event, diverged from historic cycles, where such peaks are usually observed after the halving.

This early surge fuelled a degree of overexuberance, which in turn contributed to significant price fluctuations and heightened volatility post period to date, albeit that Bitcoin is now trading at significantly higher price levels than it was during the reporting period.

The recent volatility in the market has ultimately strengthened Bitcoin's position in the hands of longer-term holders, setting the stage for a more resilient recovery, which we are now beginning to witness.

The recent 50 basis point interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in four years, combined with the expectation of increased market liquidity, bolsters our confidence that a recovery in the crypto markets is well underway. We anticipate this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, with 2025 expected to bring even greater strength to the market which in turn should create a more favourable environment for investment and growth across the broader sector.

Coinsilium's efforts over the past two years, to strategically position itself for this anticipated positive market phase, are now starting to bear fruit. During this period, we have focused on expanding and scaling our advisory services capabilities, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the expected bull market in the Web3 sector. Our structured approach not only drives forward key strategic initiatives but also lays a strong foundation for both short and medium-term value generation. Most importantly, these efforts set the stage for sustained long-term growth as we continue to leverage our expertise and strategic positioning in this rapidly evolving market.

Anticipated Yellow Token Launch and Listing in Q4 2024

A key catalyst for Coinsilium, expected in Q4 2024, is the upcoming token launch and listing of the Yellow token. As announced 21 April 2022, Coinsilium entered into a US$200,000 Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) in Yellow. Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens in this early funding round, vesting over a period of time. The token launch will mark an important liquidity event for the Company, signalling the fruition of a long-term strategic investment.

Yellow Network recently announced that it had secured $10 million in funding, led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This strategic investment comes as Yellow's market valuation reportedly reaches over US$200m, positioning Yellow as a frontrunner in the DeFi trading revolution. Other notable backers and supporters include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. This funding round also highlights the growing confidence in Yellow Network's potential to address key inefficiencies in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, such as liquidity fragmentation and scalability.

With the launch of the Yellow token, Coinsilium will stand to benefit not only from a significant liquidity event but also from the enhanced visibility and market traction Yellow is expected to gain as a result of this strong backing. The involvement of high-profile investors like Chris Larsen further strengthens the case for Yellow's long-term success, which aligns well with Coinsilium's strategic vision.

Investors are encouraged to monitor this event closely, as it not only validates Coinsilium's early-stage investment strategy but also presents a promising opportunity for growth and value realisation.

Yellow is a highly ambitious project, aiming to address key inefficiencies in the DeFi space. Should Yellow meet its objectives, it has the potential to become a key player in the decentralised clearing space, backed by strong investment, experienced partners, and a clear vision.

Further information on Yellow is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Strategic Partnership with Liteflow Driving Web3 Innovation

Following the announcement of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liteflow on 2nd July 2024, we are pleased to report that this strategic collaboration is already showing significant promise. The initiative, which offers US$1 million in dedicated seed funding for early-stage Web3 startups, has attracted strong interest from high-quality applicants within DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi sectors. The creation of an Investment Committee as part of the process, composed of both companies and certain pre-approved co-investors, further strengthens this initiative, by ensuring a rigorous procedure for the assessment and selection of projects.

The initiative also integrates Coinsilium's advisory services as a key part of the same offering. This means that, in addition to investment opportunities, we are able to provide fee-generating advisory services to promising projects, even when we do not make direct investments. The combination of financial backing and strategic advisory capabilities strengthens our ability to support high-potential startups in the Web3 space, while also creating a significant revenue stream for the Company.

The first Web3 Start-Up Pitch Day, held on 30 July 2024, attracted a strong pool of high-quality projects, reflecting a strong interest in the initiative. These pitch days are designed to vet projects from both an investment and advisory perspective, allowing us to be selective in the clients we work with. As we look forward to the next pitch day on 2 October 2024, we are confident this initiative will provide us with a strong pipeline of high-potential startup candidates for both investment and advisory services.

This collaboration with Liteflow strengthens our position in the Web3 market and underpins the long-term growth prospects of our advisory services division, which is expected to play a key role in driving Coinsilium's future revenue streams.

Otomato: A High-Potential, Fast-Accelerating Project with Near-Term Growth Catalysts

Coinsilium's recent investment in Otomato, secured via a SAFT, marks a pivotal entry into the rapidly growing Web3 automation space. Otomato's platform is designed to simplify blockchain development for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders by allowing them to automate on-chain actions in response to off-chain events. This innovation addresses a critical need in the DeFi sector for accessible, automated strategies and has garnered substantial interest from the industry, signalling significant potential for rapid growth.

Coinsilium holds a $75,000 stake in Otomato, with an option to acquire an additional $150,000 in future tokens, making it a key early-stage backer of this promising project. More importantly, Coinsilium is set to benefit from 7.5% of Otomato.xyz's revenues from launch until the Token Listing Event, expected in 2025. As revenues are anticipated to begin when the platform goes live in Q4 2024, this represents a near-term catalyst for Coinsilium's growth, providing a direct avenue for early-stage revenue generation.

Otomato is on an accelerated development timeline, with its public launch slated for Q4 2024. These will pave the way for Otomato to start generating affiliate and transaction fees as early as this year. The project is gaining considerable industry traction, as demonstrated by its participation in the MODE Yield Accelerator and the strong engagement of early testers during the beta phase. With over 2,150 followers and an active community, the platform is poised to rapidly expand its user base and establish a foothold in the burgeoning DeFi market.

Given the strong interest from the DeFi sector and the speed of Otomato's development, Coinsilium is optimistic about its potential for significant long-term value creation. The upcoming platform launch, and the eventual Token Listing Event will be critical milestones, and we look forward to providing regular updates as Otomato continues its fast-paced growth. Shareholders are encouraged to follow Otomato closely, since the project is advancing more quickly than expected, driven by high levels of interest from the DeFi community.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

As we move into what looks to be a more favourable and positive environment for the cryptocurrency market, there is much to look forward to for Coinsilium and its shareholders. With Bitcoin's strengthening market position and the expectation of further liquidity entering the market, the conditions are aligning for significant opportunities across the broader blockchain and Web3 sectors.

Coinsilium is now well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, thanks to the work undertaken over the last two years to strategically build and expand our investment and advisory operations. Our efforts have ensured that we are prepared to leverage the upcoming bull market, with our projects and partnerships fully aligned to drive growth. We are confident that this groundwork sets the stage for both short and medium term value generation while laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

Finally, the Board would like to express its sincere gratitude to our valued shareholders, partners, and team members for their continued support. With signs of favourable market conditions persisting, evidenced by the continual improvement in cryptocurrency markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on the ongoing developments and news from our existing portfolio of investments and advisory projects, which we believe will demonstrate significant progress throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

DIRECTORS' STATEMENT

The Company ended the period under review with over GBP0.4m cash at bank and GBP1.1m in other current assets including Cryptocurrencies, tokens and rights to future tokens.

The digital asset markets have recovered significantly since the start of the reporting period, which has had a markedly positive impact on the Company's cryptocurrency holdings as the profit from continuing operations increased to GBP29,545 from a loss of GBP104,247 in H1 2023.

Throughout the period, Coinsilium continued to make solid operational progress across its investment and advisory activities, and we are pleased to provide details of developments and significant news released to the market during the reporting period:

Investment Portfolio Update

Indorse and Byzant Web3 Ecosystem

On 29 January 2024, the Company provided an update regarding its investee, Web3 development company Indorse Pte. Ltd. (""Indorse""), and the ongoing collaboration with Indorse on the 'Byzant Web3 Social Network Ecosystem' (""the Collaboration""). The primary focus of this collaboration has been on the development of a range of Web3 applications. One such application, the Bastion Wallet was launched in August 2023 and enables both seasoned crypto users and newcomers to seamlessly interact with Web3 applications.

Additionally, Indorse's technical team has been working closely with A-ADS one of the longest-established and largest crypto and Bitcoin advertising networks, to develop Adbazaar, a decentralised advertising platform tailored for Web3 advertisers and publishers.

The involvement of A-ADS, whose core team brings 13 years of experience in crypto-based advertising, alongside Coinsilium and Indorse, reinforces the depth of expertise driving the development of the Byzant Web3 Ecosystem.

Web3 advertising presents a highly promising but still underdeveloped opportunity compared to its well-established role as a revenue driver in Web2 social media. Coinsilium views early movers in the Web3 advertising space, such as Adbazaar, as being well-positioned to capitalise on this emerging market. While Adbazaar is still in its development phase, the project holds significant potential to leverage early entry into the Web3 advertising landscape. Backed by industry veterans like A-ADS, the project aims to position itself as a competitive player, ready to capitalise on the nascent revenue opportunities in this sector.

Throughout the period, Adbazaar has been the primary focus for the Collaboration, due to its clearer path toward commercialisation and potential to generate early revenues. As the project gains traction in the Web3 advertising market, it will provide a solid foundation for developing the additional applications within the Byzant ecosystem. This approach allows us to focus on more immediate opportunities, while the broader range of applications will be prioritised once Adbazaar is fully refined and ready for launch.

Managing these steps carefully is essential for ensuring long-term scalability and success. The latest version of the Adbazaar platform is currently being tested by A-ADS, marking a key milestone in this strategy.

Greengage

Coinsilium holds an equity investment in Greengage Global Holding Limited (""Greengage""). Greengage's core business activity centres on providing distributed e-money account services through partnerships with regulated payments-as-a-service firms, tailored to entrepreneurs, SMEs, family offices, and digital asset firms. Greengage offers its clients personal and business e-money accounts in over 50 currencies, including GBP, EUR, and USD. Clients benefit from 24/7 account access and a dedicated relationship manager for personalised support. The services include faster payments, CHAPS, and SEPA payment services, with access to SWIFT payments and Foreign Exchange (FX) depending on the chosen regulated partner provider.

Greengage also provides value-added services through a network of third-party providers. One such service is B2B loans, with the platform facilitating over a quarter of a billion USD in lending since its inception. An example of an innovative product is lending in fiat against tradable cryptocurrencies on a non-recourse basis to provide growth capital, alongside other unique financial solutions.

During the period Greengage notified Coinsilium that it has signed an agreement with a new regulated partner to bring forward the launch of its USD currency accounts (as well as several other currencies including CHF, SEK and CAD) along with FX and SWIFT payments for its clients.

This is significant news as there still remain very few ""crypto friendly"" payment providers offering USD accounts. Greengage management expect that this new agreement will both help to attract new clients for their services as well as strengthen their existing client relationships. Greengage also advised that they continue to maintain a healthy pipeline for new account opening submissions.

Post Period Developments

On 5 July 2024 Greengage announced news of a new collaboration with global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to originate SME debt on the Coinbase Diamond Protocol. This collaboration seeks to utilise blockchain technology to provide SMEs with access to capital, promising a more efficient and transparent financing solution. The Coinbase Diamond protocol enhances the issuance and management of private capital. Using blockchain technology, the protocol issues native digital debt, making the process more secure and accessible to a broader range of investors.

In early September Greengage announced that it has been selected from over 1,228 applications to join 20 other startups in Hub71's 15th cohort in Abu Dhabi, as part of the Hub71+ Digital Assets program. At the same time, Greengage announced that it has established its first office in Abu Dhabi from where it aims to scale and grow its operations within this global tech hub.

Coindash

Coindash's main product is the SSV Network. Ssv.network is a fully decentralized, open-source ETH staking network, based on Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology. Ethereum validators are required to stake 32 ETH and operate a software validator client alongside legacy and Beacon Chain nodes. This process introduces complexity, especially as the creation of a validator results in a crucial Validator Key responsible for transaction signing. SSV Network addresses this complexity, enhancing validator key security, and delivering benefits to the broader Ethereum network, staking pools, services, and individual stakers.

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -2-

There are currently 11,233,472 SSV tokens in circulation.

As of 16 August 2024, these were the SSV Network metrics:

. 878 Operators

. 41,642 Validators

. 1,332,544 Staked ETH

. USD3.495Bn TVL (Total Valued Locked)

Revaluation of Coindash Interest

As of 31 December 2023, the price of the SSV token stood at USD6.83 per token. By 30 June 2024 at the end of the reporting period, the token price had increased to USD36.09, with a peak of USD61.30 per token recorded on 26 March 2024 with a fully diluted market capitalization for the total supply of SSV tokens at USUSD713.4 million.

Given the substantial SSV token holdings in Coindash's cryptocurrency treasury and the significant price appreciation of SSV tokens throughout the reporting period, the Company has determined to revalue its interest in Coindash. This decision is grounded in the material increase in the value of Coindash's liquid SSV holdings, and the revaluation is applied pro-rata to the Company's stake in Coindash.

While the price of the SSV token experienced a significant increase of 528% over the reporting period, the Company's revalued its stake in Coindash by 346%, adjusted to reflect the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) performance of the SSV token. This adjustment takes into account the fluctuations in SSV tokens market liquidity and its overall trading volume during the period.

Silta Finance

Coinsilium holds a convertible loan and option interest in Silta. During the period, Silta notified Coinsilium that it had received an investment from a top 10 global infrastructure development bank (""Bank"") as part of a strategic partnership agreement to build a climate financing marketplace, powered by AI, for bankability and sustainability assessments. This strategic partnership aims to help support governments, infrastructure developers, and financial institutions to reach their goals of deploying USUSD800B towards Climate Financing by 2030. Silta's strategic partnership with the Bank aims to create the benchmark for climate financing due diligence, thereby unlocking an USUSD800B opportunity within Asian markets, opening the door to a USUSD1.3T global market for projects driving the transition from fossil fuels to renewables.

Post Period Developments

In a recent update Silta advised its shareholders that is has been building on its work over the last 8 month and is now working on a contract extension with a global bank to continue the development of its white-label solution as they prepare to go into production-grade and publicly launch the platform.

On 14 September 2023 Coinsilium announced that Seedcoin, its 100% owned Gibraltar subsidiary, had signed a Convertible Loan Agreement and Option Agreement with Silta as a cornerstone investor in their funding round. The Convertible Loan Agreement provided a loan principal amount of USD50,000 at a pre-money valuation of USD5m. The loan was granted for a period of six months, converting at maturity into 22,306 new common shares of Silta at a price of USD 2.2416 per share.

As at the time of this report we note that there has been a delay in the issuance of the new shares, and it is expected that the new shares will be issued to Coinsilium within the coming weeks. The Option Agreement for up to USD500,000 provides the rights to subscribe to up to 163,575 new shares in Silta at a pre-money valuation of USD7.5m valid for 12 months from 8 September 2023.

An addendum to the Option Agreement was executed on 16 September 2024 whereby the parties agreed on an extension of the Long-Stop Date by 6 months which effectively means that the Option Agreement will now be valid till 7 March 2025.

Post Period Events

Strategic Web3 Collaboration with Liteflow

On 2 July 2024 Coinsilium announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MoU"") with Liteflow, Inc (""Liteflow""), an experienced Web3 and NFT technical developer. The MoU is the first step in a planned long-term strategic collaboration between Coinsilium and Liteflow, which aims to provide financial backing, comprehensive advisory services, and cutting-edge technological resources to help budding companies navigate the complexities of the Web3 landscape and maximize their chances of long-term business success.

SAFT to acquire Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol Tokens

On 3 July 2024 Consilium announced that it had entered into a SAFT with the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol. Otomato is designed to simplify interactions with DeFi platforms through automation and user-friendly interfaces. It can help bridge the gap for DeFi traders without coding skills by automating complex tasks and providing clear, intuitive guides.

Otomato.xyz is the first decentralised application of the Protocol and enables De-Fi traders to create and automate their own Web3 trading strategies as a succession of on-chain actions which can integrate reactions to off-chain events. User control and security on the platform are ensured through account abstraction (ERC-4337), making blockchain automation accessible and efficient for all users.

Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD75,000 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Early Backers' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. Coinsilium also has the option to acquire an additional USD150,150 in value of the future tokens of the Otomato Web3 Automation Protocol in accordance with the 'Strategic' token allocation pricing and vesting terms. In addition, Coinsilium will earn 7.5% of revenues generated by the Otomato.xyz platform up to the time of the Token Listing Event, anticipated to occur during 2025.

Revenues will be predominantly derived from affiliate fees from actions executed through integrated protocols and fees from transactions initiated via the Otomato.xyz platform. The public launch of the platform is expected by Q4 2024, when revenues would be expected to commence.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

Elevate Health

Elevate Health has progressed in its transformation into a decentralised science (DeSci) project, focusing on creating a platform that rewards members for contributing and accessing data, research, and treatments in preventative healthcare.

The project is currently in discussions with a prominent, yet undisclosed, decentralised launchpad, which has raised approximately USD1 billion for various token projects over the past three years. It is noteworthy that DeSci-related tokens have shown strong post-launch performance compared to other sectors.

Elevate Health has advised Coinsilium that it is targeting a potential token issuance by the end of 2024. Further updates will be provided to the market as and when available.

Arcadian Youth Pte Ltd (formerly ""StartupToken"")

StartupToken has successfully transitioned its business model to focus on Web3 Real World Asset (""RWA"") tokenization, with an initial emphasis on the Bali real estate market.

The company's flagship application, Propex, is now in the advanced stages of development. Propex is designed to streamline the transaction of real estate assets by bringing ownership transfers onto the blockchain. This aims to automate and simplify the process for property owners and their counterparties by tokenizing property contracts into unique, programmable assets (NFTs). These NFTs can be used for various Web3 applications, such as trading, collateralized loans, and more. Propex offers real estate agents and notaries a minting service to create on-chain proof of ownership, while maintaining the existing system of record. The blockchain-based records serve as tamper-proof, verified copies that co-exist with the traditional system until full adoption of on-chain processes. While the initial market focus is on Bali, Indonesia, the Propex solution has potential applications in other regions beyond this initial market.

The Arcadian Youth team recently updated the Company, reporting that the first development stage of the blockchain-based application has been completed. In this initial phase, the application allows users to mint 'location NFTs,' enabling them to participate in challenges and earn points. The second stage will introduce the ability for property owners to mint their real estate NFTs, with notary verification, unlocking access to decentralised finance (DeFi) and RWA exchange platforms.

Additionally, the team informed us that their application for a grant from Lisk, a Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum and part of the Optimism Superchain, was successful. Lisk is focused on providing solutions for emerging markets through the tokenization of RWAs, which aligns well with Propex's goals.

We will continue to update the market with news and developments regarding Propex as the project progresses.

Outlook

Bitcoin's sharp rise throughout the period in review, culminating in a new all-time high prior to the May 'halving' event, diverged from historic cycles, where such peaks are usually observed after the halving.

This early surge fuelled a degree of overexuberance, which in turn contributed to significant price fluctuations and heightened volatility post period to date, albeit that Bitcoin is now trading at significantly higher price levels than it was during the reporting period.

The recent volatility in the market has ultimately strengthened Bitcoin's position in the hands of longer-term holders, setting the stage for a more resilient recovery, which we are now beginning to witness.

The recent 50 basis point interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in four years, combined with the expectation of increased market liquidity, bolsters our confidence that a recovery in the crypto markets is well underway. We anticipate this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year, with 2025 expected to bring even greater strength to the market which in turn should create a more favourable environment for investment and growth across the broader sector.

Coinsilium's efforts over the past two years, to strategically position itself for this anticipated positive market phase, are now starting to bear fruit. During this period, we have focused on expanding and scaling our advisory services capabilities, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the expected bull market in the Web3 sector. Our structured approach not only drives forward key strategic initiatives but also lays a strong foundation for both short and medium-term value generation. Most importantly, these efforts set the stage for sustained long-term growth as we continue to leverage our expertise and strategic positioning in this rapidly evolving market.

Anticipated Yellow Token Launch and Listing in Q4 2024

(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires

September 27, 2024 06:51 ET (10:51 GMT)

DJ Coinsilium Group Limited: UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED -4-

A key catalyst for Coinsilium, expected in Q4 2024, is the upcoming token launch and listing of the Yellow token. As announced 21 April 2022, Coinsilium entered into a USUSD200,000 Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) in Yellow. Under the terms of the SAFT, Coinsilium will receive USD200,000 in value of YELLOW tokens in this early funding round, vesting over a period of time. The token launch will mark an important liquidity event for the Company, signalling the fruition of a long-term strategic investment.

Yellow Network recently announced that it had secured USD10 million in funding, led by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. This strategic investment comes as Yellow's market valuation reportedly reaches over USUSD200m, positioning Yellow as a frontrunner in the DeFi trading revolution. Other notable backers and supporters include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. This funding round also highlights the growing confidence in Yellow Network's potential to address key inefficiencies in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, such as liquidity fragmentation and scalability.

With the launch of the Yellow token, Coinsilium will stand to benefit not only from a significant liquidity event but also from the enhanced visibility and market traction Yellow is expected to gain as a result of this strong backing. The involvement of high-profile investors like Chris Larsen further strengthens the case for Yellow's long-term success, which aligns well with Coinsilium's strategic vision.

Investors are encouraged to monitor this event closely, as it not only validates Coinsilium's early-stage investment strategy but also presents a promising opportunity for growth and value realisation.

Yellow is a highly ambitious project, aiming to address key inefficiencies in the DeFi space. Should Yellow meet its objectives, it has the potential to become a key player in the decentralised clearing space, backed by strong investment, experienced partners, and a clear vision.

Strategic Partnership with Liteflow Driving Web3 Innovation

Following the announcement of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liteflow on 2nd July 2024, we are pleased to report that this strategic collaboration is already showing significant promise. The initiative, which offers USUSD1 million in dedicated seed funding for early-stage Web3 startups, has attracted strong interest from high-quality applicants within DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi sectors. The creation of an Investment Committee as part of the process, composed of both companies and certain pre-approved co-investors, further strengthens this initiative, by ensuring a rigorous procedure for the assessment and selection of projects.

The initiative also integrates Coinsilium's advisory services as a key part of the same offering. This means that, in addition to investment opportunities, we are able to provide fee-generating advisory services to promising projects, even when we do not make direct investments. The combination of financial backing and strategic advisory capabilities strengthens our ability to support high-potential startups in the Web3 space, while also creating a significant revenue stream for the Company.

The first Web3 Start-Up Pitch Day, held on 30 July 2024, attracted a strong pool of high-quality projects, reflecting a strong interest in the initiative. These pitch days are designed to vet projects from both an investment and advisory perspective, allowing us to be selective in the clients we work with. As we look forward to the next pitch day on 2 October 2024, we are confident this initiative will provide us with a strong pipeline of high-potential startup candidates for both investment and advisory services.

This collaboration with Liteflow strengthens our position in the Web3 market and underpins the long-term growth prospects of our advisory services division, which is expected to play a key role in driving Coinsilium's future revenue streams.

Otomato: A High-Potential, Fast-Accelerating Project with Near-Term Growth Catalysts

Coinsilium's recent investment in Otomato, secured via a SAFT, marks a pivotal entry into the rapidly growing Web3 automation space. Otomato's platform is designed to simplify blockchain development for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders by allowing them to automate on-chain actions in response to off-chain events. This innovation addresses a critical need in the DeFi sector for accessible, automated strategies and has garnered substantial interest from the industry, signalling significant potential for rapid growth.

Coinsilium holds a USD75,000 stake in Otomato, with an option to acquire an additional USD150,000 in future tokens, making it a key early-stage backer of this promising project. More importantly, Coinsilium is set to benefit from 7.5% of Otomato.xyz's revenues from launch until the Token Listing Event, expected in 2025. As revenues are anticipated to begin when the platform goes live in Q4 2024, this represents a near-term catalyst for Coinsilium's growth, providing a direct avenue for early-stage revenue generation.

Otomato is on an accelerated development timeline, with its public launch slated for Q4 2024. These will pave the way for Otomato to start generating affiliate and transaction fees as early as this year. The project is gaining considerable industry traction, as demonstrated by its participation in the MODE Yield Accelerator and the strong engagement of early testers during the beta phase. With over 2,150 followers and an active community, the platform is poised to rapidly expand its user base and establish a foothold in the burgeoning DeFi market.

Given the strong interest from the DeFi sector and the speed of Otomato's development, Coinsilium is optimistic about its potential for significant long-term value creation. The upcoming platform launch, and the eventual Token Listing Event will be critical milestones, and we look forward to providing regular updates as Otomato continues its fast-paced growth. Shareholders are encouraged to follow Otomato closely, since the project is advancing more quickly than expected, driven by high levels of interest from the DeFi community.

Further information on Otomato is available in our Web3 report, available for download from the Coinsilium Website: https://coinsilium.com/investors/web3-reports

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we move into what looks to be a more favourable and positive environment for the cryptocurrency market, there is much to look forward to for Coinsilium and its shareholders. With Bitcoin's strengthening market position and the expectation of further liquidity entering the market, the conditions are aligning for significant opportunities across the broader blockchain and Web3 sectors.

Coinsilium is now well-positioned to capitalise on these opportunities, thanks to the work undertaken over the last two years to strategically build and expand our investment and advisory operations. Our efforts have ensured that we are prepared to leverage the upcoming bull market, with our projects and partnerships fully aligned to drive growth. We are confident that this groundwork sets the stage for both short and medium term value generation while laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth.

Finally, the Board would like to express its sincere gratitude to our valued shareholders, partners, and team members for their continued support. With signs of favourable market conditions persisting, evidenced by the continual improvement in cryptocurrency markets, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on the ongoing developments and news from our existing portfolio of investments and advisory projects, which we believe will demonstrate significant progress throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

The world of online gambling has been revolutionized by the advent of cryptocurrencies, and Greece is no exception to this trend.

Crypto casinos have emerged as a popular alternative to traditional online gambling platforms, offering Greek players a unique blend of cutting-edge technology and classic casino entertainment.

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of crypto gambling in Greece, exploring its intricacies, legal landscape, and practical aspects.

Crypto casinos have gained significant traction in Greece over recent years. As a country with a rich history of gaming and a population increasingly interested in digital currencies, Greece has become a fertile ground for the growth of crypto gambling.

This rising popularity can be attributed to various factors, including the anonymity, speed, and potential cost-effectiveness that cryptocurrencies offer to players.

Understanding Crypto Casinos

Crypto casinos are online gambling platforms that accept cryptocurrencies as a method of payment. Unlike traditional online casinos that primarily deal with fiat currencies, these innovative platforms allow players to deposit, wager, and withdraw using digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

The fundamental difference between crypto casinos and their traditional counterparts lies in the underlying technology and payment infrastructure.

Crypto casinos leverage blockchain technology, which offers enhanced security, transparency, and often, faster transaction speeds.

This technological edge translates into a range of benefits for Greek players, including increased privacy, reduced transaction fees, and in some cases, provably fair gaming.

One of the key advantages of using cryptocurrencies for gambling is the level of anonymity it provides. While traditional online casinos require extensive personal information for registration and transactions, crypto casinos often need minimal details, appealing to privacy-conscious Greek players.

Additionally, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means that transactions are not subject to the same level of scrutiny or potential restrictions as traditional banking methods.

Legal Status of Crypto Casinos in Greece

The legal landscape for crypto casinos in Greece is complex and evolving. As of 2024, Greece does not have specific regulations addressing crypto gambling.

Instead, online gambling activities fall under the general gambling laws of the country, which have undergone significant changes in recent years.

In 2011, Greece introduced Law 4002/2011, which established a regulatory framework for online gambling. The Hellenic Gaming Commission (HGC) was created to oversee and regulate the gambling industry.

However, these regulations were primarily designed with traditional online casinos in mind and do not explicitly address the use of cryptocurrencies in gambling.

Currently, online casinos operating in Greece require a license from the HGC. However, many crypto casinos operate in a grey area, as they are often based offshore and may not hold a Greek license.

Greek authorities have made efforts to block access to unlicensed gambling sites, but the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the global reach of the internet make enforcement challenging.

How We Selected the Best Casinos for Greece

In compiling this guide, we have carefully evaluated various crypto casinos accessible to Greek players. Our selection criteria prioritize platforms that offer a safe, enjoyable, and fair gambling experience.

We consider factors such as licensing (even if not specifically from Greek authorities), reputation within the crypto gambling community, game variety, security measures, and customer support quality.

Special attention is given to casinos that cater to Greek players, offering Greek language support, accepting popular payment methods in Greece, and providing games that appeal to Greek preferences.

We also consider the casino's track record in processing withdrawals promptly and their overall transparency in operations.

Features to Look for in a Crypto Casino

When choosing a crypto casino in Greece, players should consider the following key features:

Popular Cryptocurrencies Accepted by Greek Casinos

While the specific cryptocurrencies accepted can vary between casinos, the following are commonly found options:

Embarking on your crypto gambling journey in Greece requires some initial setup. The first step is to create a cryptocurrency wallet. This digital wallet will store your cryptocurrencies and facilitate transactions with the casino.

There are various types of wallets available, including software wallets (desktop or mobile apps), hardware wallets (physical devices), and online wallets.

Each type has its own set of advantages and security considerations, so it's worth researching to find the one that best suits your needs.

Once you have a wallet, the next step is to acquire cryptocurrencies. Greek residents can purchase cryptocurrencies through various means.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are the most common option, allowing you to buy digital currencies using euros or other fiat currencies.

Some popular exchanges accessible to Greek users include Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase. Local Bitcoin ATMs, though less common, are another option for purchasing cryptocurrencies with cash.

When you're ready to start gambling, the process of making deposits and withdrawals at crypto casinos is relatively straightforward.

To deposit, you'll typically need to send cryptocurrency from your wallet to the casino's designated address. Most casinos provide clear instructions and often generate a unique address for each transaction to enhance security.

Withdrawals follow a similar process in reverse. You request a withdrawal from the casino, provide your wallet address, and the casino sends the funds. It's important to double-check all addresses when making transactions, as cryptocurrency transfers are irreversible.

Responsible Gambling in Crypto Casinos

While crypto gambling can be an exciting pastime, it's crucial to approach it responsibly. Many reputable crypto casinos offer tools to help players maintain control over their gambling habits. These may include:

Greek players struggling with gambling addiction can seek help from organizations such as KETHEA (Therapy Center for Dependent Individuals) or the Hellenic Center for Mental Health and Treatment of Substance Use. These organizations offer support and resources for individuals dealing with gambling-related issues.

Disadvantages:

Conclusion

The landscape of online gambling in Greece is evolving rapidly with the integration of cryptocurrency options. These crypto casinos offer Greek players a new level of convenience, security, and excitement. From generous welcome bonuses to a wide array of games, there's something for every type of player.

As you explore these platforms, remember to gamble responsibly and stay informed about the latest regulations in Greece regarding online gambling and cryptocurrency use.

With the right approach, crypto casinos can provide an entertaining and potentially rewarding experience for Greek players looking to combine their passion for gambling with the innovative world of digital currencies.

The legal status of crypto casinos in Greece is complex. While online gambling is regulated by the Hellenic Gaming Commission, specific legislation regarding cryptocurrency gambling is still evolving. It's important to stay updated on the latest laws and regulations. Many Greek players access international crypto casinos, but it's advisable to consult with a legal expert for the most current information.

What cryptocurrencies can I use at Greek crypto casinos?

The most commonly accepted cryptocurrencies at online casinos include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Some casinos may also accept newer or less common cryptocurrencies. Always check the specific payment options available at each casino before signing up.

How do I get started with a crypto casino in Greece?

A Beginner's Guide for New Traders,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/USXlxOJf-A-Beginner-s-Guide-for-New-Traders/,2024-09-26,TradingView,"Introduction to Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency has become a major financial trend in recent years, attracting both experienced traders and newcomers alike. If you're just starting out, this guide will help you understand the basics of cryptocurrency and what it takes to start trading.

1. What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies like the US dollar or Euro, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. This means that they are not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or bank.

The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC), but there are thousands of others, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC).

2. How Does Cryptocurrency Work?

Cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, which is essentially a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers (nodes). These transactions are grouped into blocks and added to the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Since every transaction is verified by the network, there is no need for a middleman (like a bank), reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency.

3. Common Types of Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin (BTC): The first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, often referred to as ""digital gold.""

Ethereum (ETH): Known for its smart contract functionality, Ethereum is a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps).

Stablecoins (USDT, USDC): Cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of traditional currencies like the US dollar, offering stability and reducing price volatility.

Altcoins: A broad term for any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. These include a wide range of coins like Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and more niche coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE).

4. Why Trade Cryptocurrency?

High Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically, providing opportunities for traders to profit from price movements.

24/7 Market: Unlike traditional stock markets, cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7, allowing traders to trade at any time.

Global Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, making it possible to trade from anywhere in the world.

5. How to Start Trading Cryptocurrency

To start trading cryptocurrencies, follow these steps:

Step 1: Choose a Cryptocurrency Exchange

A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Some popular exchanges include:

Binance: One of the largest exchanges, offering a wide range of coins and trading pairs.

Coinbase: Known for its user-friendly interface, making it ideal for beginners.

Kraken: Offers a variety of coins and advanced trading tools.

Step 2: Create an Account

Once you've chosen an exchange, you'll need to sign up by providing your email and personal information. Most exchanges will require you to verify your identity before you can start trading.

Step 3: Deposit Funds

After creating your account, you can deposit funds into your exchange wallet. Most exchanges accept deposits via bank transfer, credit/debit cards, or other cryptocurrencies.

Step 4: Choose a Trading Pair

In cryptocurrency trading, you'll often be trading pairs, such as BTC/USDT (Bitcoin/US Dollar Tether). You'll be buying one currency while selling another. For example, if you believe Bitcoin will rise in value against the US dollar, you'd buy BTC/USDT.

Step 5: Place a Trade

There are two main types of trades:

Market Order: This is an order to buy or sell immediately at the current market price.

Limit Order: This is an order to buy or sell at a specific price. The trade will only execute when the price reaches your target.

6. Basic Trading Strategies

There are several strategies traders use to make profits in the cryptocurrency market. Here are a few basic ones:

HODLing: This refers to holding onto your cryptocurrency for a long period, regardless of market fluctuations, expecting it to rise in value over time.

Day Trading: Buying and selling within a single day, aiming to profit from small price movements.

Swing Trading: Holding onto an asset for several days or weeks, attempting to profit from short- to medium-term price movements.

Scalping: Making quick trades for small profits over a very short time period, often minutes or seconds.

7. Key Concepts for New Traders

Volatility: Cryptocurrency is known for its wild price swings. As a trader, you'll need to understand that prices can go up and down very quickly.

Liquidity: This refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting the market price. High liquidity means you can trade larger amounts without causing significant price changes.

Market Capitalization (Market Cap): This is the total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the price by the total supply of coins. It gives a rough indication of the size and popularity of a coin.

8. Risks of Cryptocurrency Trading

Market Volatility: Prices can swing dramatically, leading to significant gains or losses.

Security Risks: Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets are often targeted by hackers. Always use secure exchanges, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and store your assets in a secure wallet (e.g., hardware wallet).

Regulatory Risks: Governments may impose regulations on cryptocurrency trading, which could affect the market.

9. Security and Wallets

When you're trading cryptocurrency, it's important to know how to secure your assets:

Exchange Wallets: These are provided by the exchange where you trade, but they can be vulnerable to hacks.

Software Wallets: Apps or programs where you store your cryptocurrency. They're more secure than exchange wallets but still vulnerable to online threats.

Hardware Wallets: Physical devices, such as Ledger or Trezor, that store your crypto offline, offering the highest level of security.

10. Tax Implications

In most countries, cryptocurrency profits are subject to taxes. Be sure to check your local tax laws and keep track of your trades for tax reporting purposes.

11. Start Small and Learn

If you're a beginner, it's important to start small. Trade with an amount you're comfortable losing, as the cryptocurrency market can be unpredictable. As you gain more experience and understand how the market works, you can gradually increase your investments.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrency trading offers exciting opportunities, but it also comes with risks. Understanding the basics, choosing the right strategies, and being cautious are essential to becoming a successful trader. Keep learning, stay updated with market trends, and don't rush into decisions without proper research.

The world of online gambling is evolving rapidly, and Hungary is no exception to this trend. Crypto casinos, which allow players to gamble using digital currencies, are gaining traction in this Central European nation.

These innovative platforms are reshaping the gambling landscape, offering Hungarian players new ways to engage in their favorite pastime.

Cryptocurrency gambling has seen a surge in popularity in Hungary over recent years. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including the increasing acceptance of digital currencies, the desire for more privacy in financial transactions, and the unique benefits that crypto casinos offer to players.

As more Hungarians become familiar with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the appeal of using these digital assets for online gambling continues to grow.

Understanding Crypto Casinos

Crypto casinos are online gambling platforms that accept cryptocurrencies as a method of payment. These digital casinos operate similarly to traditional online casinos but with the added dimension of blockchain technology.

Instead of using fiat currencies like the Hungarian Forint, players can deposit, wager, and withdraw using various cryptocurrencies.

The key difference between crypto casinos and traditional online casinos lies in the payment methods and the underlying technology. Crypto casinos leverage blockchain technology, which offers enhanced security, transparency, and often faster transaction speeds.

This technology also allows for provably fair gaming, a concept that's gaining popularity among players who value fairness and transparency in their gambling activities.

One of the main advantages of using cryptocurrencies for gambling is the level of anonymity it provides. While not entirely anonymous, crypto transactions offer a higher degree of privacy compared to traditional banking methods.

This feature is particularly attractive to Hungarian players who prefer to keep their gambling activities discreet.

Another significant advantage is the speed of transactions. Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are typically processed much faster than traditional banking methods, allowing players to access their funds more quickly.

This speed is especially beneficial for withdrawals, which can sometimes take days or even weeks with conventional online casinos.

Legal Status of Crypto Casinos in Hungary

The legal landscape for crypto casinos in Hungary is complex and evolving. Currently, Hungary does not have specific regulations addressing cryptocurrency gambling.

The country's gambling laws primarily focus on traditional forms of gambling and online casinos using fiat currencies.

Under Hungarian law, online gambling is legal but strictly regulated. The state-owned Szerencsejáték Zrt holds a monopoly on most forms of gambling in the country.

However, this monopoly doesn't explicitly cover crypto casinos, creating a grey area in the regulatory framework.

While there are no specific licensing requirements for crypto casinos in Hungary, operators targeting Hungarian players should be aware of the general online gambling regulations in the country.

The Hungarian Gambling Supervision Authority oversees gambling activities, but its jurisdiction over crypto casinos remains unclear.

It's important to note that the legal situation may change as the Hungarian government continues to adapt to the growing cryptocurrency market. Players should stay informed about any regulatory updates that may affect their ability to engage in crypto gambling.

How We Selected the Best Casinos for Hungary

When evaluating crypto casinos for Hungarian players, several factors were taken into consideration. These include the casino's reputation, game selection, supported cryptocurrencies, security measures, and customer support options.

Special attention was given to platforms that cater to Hungarian players, offering Hungarian language support and accepting popular payment methods in the country.

We also considered the casino's licensing and regulatory compliance. While specific crypto casino licenses may not be available in Hungary, reputable platforms often hold licenses from recognized international regulatory bodies, providing an additional layer of trust and security for players.

Features to Look for in a Crypto Casino

When choosing a crypto casino in Hungary, players should consider the following features:

Popular Cryptocurrencies Accepted by Hungarian Casinos

Crypto casinos catering to Hungarian players typically accept a range of cryptocurrencies, including:

For Hungarian players new to crypto gambling, getting started involves a few key steps. First, you'll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet.

This digital wallet will store your cryptocurrencies and allow you to make transactions. There are various types of wallets available, including software wallets (desktop or mobile apps) and hardware wallets (physical devices for storing cryptocurrencies offline).

Once you have a wallet, the next step is to purchase cryptocurrencies. Hungarian players have several options for buying crypto, including local cryptocurrency exchanges, international platforms, and peer-to-peer marketplaces. It's important to research and choose a reputable exchange that complies with local regulations.

When you're ready to start gambling, select a crypto casino that accepts players from Hungary. Create an account and navigate to the cashier or banking section. Here, you'll find the option to deposit using cryptocurrencies.

The casino will provide you with a unique wallet address for your deposit. Use your cryptocurrency wallet to send the desired amount to this address.

Withdrawals follow a similar process. Request a withdrawal from the casino, specifying the amount and the cryptocurrency you wish to use. Provide your wallet address, and the casino will process the transaction.

Crypto withdrawals are typically faster than traditional banking methods, often completing within minutes or hours.

Responsible Gambling in Crypto Casinos

Responsible gambling is crucial, regardless of the currency used. Reputable crypto casinos serving Hungarian players should offer tools and resources to promote responsible gambling. These may include:

Setting limits: Players should be able to set deposit limits, loss limits, and session time limits to manage their gambling activity.

Self-exclusion options: Casinos should provide the option for players to temporarily or permanently exclude themselves from gambling activities.

Resources for problem gambling: Information and links to organizations offering support for gambling addiction should be readily available.

In Hungary, the National Center for Addictions (Nemzeti Drog Fókuszpont) provides resources and support for individuals struggling with gambling addiction. Players should be aware of these resources and seek help if they feel their gambling is becoming problematic.

Disadvantages:

Conclusion

The world of crypto casinos in Hungary offers an exciting and innovative approach to online gambling. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, these platforms provide Hungarian players with a secure, anonymous, and efficient way to enjoy their favorite casino games.

The best crypto casinos for Hungarian players combine a wide range of games, generous bonuses, top-notch security, and excellent customer support. They also ensure compliance with local regulations while offering the benefits of blockchain technology.

As you explore the options we've presented, remember to gamble responsibly and choose a platform that aligns with your preferences and needs. With the right crypto casino, you can enjoy a thrilling gaming experience while taking advantage of the unique benefits that cryptocurrencies bring to the table.

The legal status of crypto casinos in Hungary is somewhat complex. While online gambling is regulated in Hungary, there are no specific laws addressing cryptocurrency gambling. Many crypto casinos operate in a gray area, accepting Hungarian players without a local license. However, it's important to note that players should always be aware of the current legal landscape and any potential risks involved.

How do I choose a reliable crypto casino in Hungary?

When selecting a crypto casino in Hungary, consider factors such as licensing, game variety, supported cryptocurrencies, security measures, customer support, and user reviews. Look for casinos that use provably fair gaming systems and have a good reputation in the online gambling community. It's also wise to choose platforms that offer responsible gambling tools and clear terms and conditions.

What cryptocurrencies can I use at Hungarian crypto casinos?

Most crypto casinos accepting Hungarian players support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Some platforms may also accept lesser-known altcoins. Always check the casino's banking page for a complete list of supported cryptocurrencies.

Are winnings from crypto casinos taxable in Hungary?

In Hungary, gambling winnings are generally not taxable for individual players. However, the tax laws regarding cryptocurrency gains can be complex and may vary. It's advisable to consult with a tax professional for the most up-to-date information on how to handle crypto casino winnings in your tax declarations.

How do I deposit and withdraw at a crypto casino?

To deposit, you'll typically need to send cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the casino's wallet address. For withdrawals, you'll request a payout to your wallet address. The process is usually quick and straightforward, with most transactions completed within minutes to a few hours, depending on the cryptocurrency and network congestion.

Are crypto casinos safe?

Reputable crypto casinos use advanced security measures like SSL encryption and two-factor authentication to protect user data and funds. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology provides an extra layer of security and transparency. However, it's crucial to choose well-established casinos with good track records and to practice safe online habits.

Can I play at crypto casinos anonymously?

Many crypto casinos offer a higher degree of anonymity compared to traditional online casinos. Some platforms allow you to play with minimal personal information. However, due to KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations, you may need to verify your identity, especially for larger withdrawals.

What types of games are available at crypto casinos for Hungarian players?

Crypto casinos typically offer a wide range of games including slots, table games (like blackjack, roulette, and baccarat), live dealer games, video poker, and sometimes sports betting. Many also feature provably fair games, which are unique to crypto gambling platforms and allow players to verify the fairness of each game outcome.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best-bitcoin-casino-hungary.jpg,0.3098039215686275
"Ethereum price today: ETH is down 0.35% today, trading at $2,627.61",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-26-2024/,2024-09-26,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site. This commission does not influence our editors' opinions or evaluations. Please view our full advertiser disclosure policy.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, was $2,627.61 as of 8 a.m. ET. The crypto's highest intraday price in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Although ethereum is not the first altcoin, it's the most popular and successful. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Its blockchain has generated tremendous growth and returns over the past nine years.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $316.53 billion. It's up 61% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $316.53 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $307 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $291 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 70% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,627.61.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 61% year over year, compared to a 141% gain for bitcoin.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1607843137254903
"Coinbase Launches cbBTC, a Wrapped Bitcoin Token: A Game-Changer for Crypto | Bitcoinist.com",https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-launches-cbbtc-a-wrapped-bitcoin-token-a-game-changer-for-crypto/,2024-09-26,Bitcoinist.com,"In a move that would solidify it as not just the platform to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, Coinbase, on Thursday, 12th of September, announced the launch of its own wrapped Bitcoin token called cbBTC, an ER-20 on the Ethereum network and its layer-2 scaling network Base. This move is significant not just to Coinbase as it moves away from being just a crypto exchange platform but also to the entire crypto community.

It's well known that the value of cryptocurrencies, including the leading Bitcoin, is heavily influenced by public sentiment. A key way to keep that sentiment positive is by expanding their use cases and integrating them into as many sectors and aspects of daily life as possible. The introduction of wrapped Bitcoin would benefit a significant portion of the crypto community, impacting various submarkets that operate with cryptocurrency. For instance, any instant Bitcoin casino is likely to attract more users eager to take advantage of their bonuses and rewards, crypto exchanges would experience increased activity, and DeFi systems could see more individuals shifting away from traditional finance.

This is a lot to unpack. In this article, we will analyze what makes this move so newsworthy and why everyone needs to pay attention.

Wrapping, in crypto-speak, is the process of creating a digital asset that represents another cryptocurrency but can be used on a different blockchain. This is done to make assets like Bitcoin (BTC), which exists on its blockchain, usable on other networks, such as Ethereum, which has its own decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

A wrapped token maintains a 1:1 peg with the original asset, just like the cbBTC maintains a 1:1 with Bitcoin. For every cbBTC token in existence, a corresponding Bitcoin is held in reserve by Coinbase. Essentially, cbBTC is a digital representation or some sort of receipt for the Bitcoin that can be used on another blockchain.

Hence, CoinBase's cbBTC-wrapped token could help bridge the gap between the original Bitcoin blockchain and the thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on Ethereum. It automatically mints cbBTC tokens whenever a user deposits Bitcoin to another Blockchain at a 1:1 ratio. When the user needs to redeem their Bitcoin, they send the tokens to the Coinbase address, and they get the standard Bitcoin returned.

The cbBTC launch helps to expand Bitcoin's utility. As DeFi is booming, it is only logical that Bitcoin, which has the largest cryptocurrency market cap, should be able to interact with Ethereum and other blockchains.

Also, by converting Bitcoin to cbBTC, holders can lend their cbBTC to earn interest, provide liquidity in decentralized exchanges, or stake cbBTC in DeFi platforms. This extends Bitcoin's utility beyond being a store of value or a medium of exchange. This wrapped coin has the potential to allow Bitcoin holders to participate more freely in the market.

DeFi is already changing the way we transact in many ways. For example, the integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) into the world of casinos and gaming has helped to revolutionize the industry. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeFi offers players a more transparent, secure, and decentralized gaming experience.

Additionally, DeFi can enable players to access a wider range of games and betting markets and participate in innovative financial products like yield farming and staking. DeFI services, lending applications, and exchanges are expected to start offering support to cbBTC, and the token will soon be available to Coinbase users in the US, Singapore, Australia, and Brazil.

While Coinbase was preparing for its launch, something else was going on in the world of wrapped tokens. BitGo, which is currently leading the Wrapped tokens category and is worth over $8 billion, faced some backlash after announcing plans to transition the custodial structure of its WBTC to Singapore and Hong Kong under a multi-jurisdiction and multi-institution arrangement.

BitGo CEO Mike Belsche stated that this new system would be in partnership with Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem. Sun's involvement has been touted as an ""unacceptable level of risk "" in light of his ongoing case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

In a rather amusing turn of events, however, Justin Sun also took to his X page after the Coinbase launch to highlight the shortcomings of the cbBTC.

Coinbase's move into wrapped tokens is significant not just in terms of its impact on the crypto ecosystem but also in terms of what it says about the company's future and a broader strategic move to capture another part of the Crypto market. Coinbase has over a decade of experience securing billions in Bitcoins for its customers.

With this launch, Coinbase is repositioning itself to take advantage of the DeFi boom while maintaining its role as a peer-to-peer platform. Despite Coinbase's reputation, it is still going outside of its comfort zone to compete, exemplifying the ever-expansive nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.",https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/b1_d02dec.png,0.3411764705882352
10 Ways to Get Rich with Cryptocurrency in 2024 | NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/10-ways-to-get-rich-with-cryptocurrency-in-2024/,2024-09-26,NewsBTC,"Cryptocurrency has really revolutionized finance by allowing so many different ways one can gain wealth. Starting from staking and trading to yield farming and even NFTs, crypto enthusiasts have a few options for growing an income. This article shall walk you through 10 ways you can get rich with cryptocurrency in 2024. With the full knowledge of the potential that each of these methods possesses, you will be able to choose for yourself the best strategy to make your goals happen.

Staking has turned into one of the most popular ways of creating passive income within the crypto world. It involves locking your cryptocurrency in the blockchain network for use in verifying the transactions that are to be adopted into it, ensuring the network is functional and safe. In return, you will receive staking rewards dependent on the used network and the amount of crypto that you stake. Staking is particularly attractive to long-term holders who wish to minimize active trading. This offers a more stable, predictable return compared to other methods of investing in crypto.

This is a one-stop platform that assists in connecting users with bonus rewards from various blockchain stakings. The website includes details on all the best staking plans, their potential returns, and how to exploit them. Be it Cardano ADA, Polkadot DOT, Ethereum ETH, or every other known cryptocurrency staking, StakingBonus presents you with the knowledge you need to make a decision.

Registration Process

To start using StakingBonus, follow these few easy steps:

Follow specific staking instructions for a certain cryptocurrency network.

Bitcoin (BTC): Usually a Proof-of-Work asset, BTC staking options on StakingBonus represent an alternative for those investors who seek more stable, long-term growth.

Litecoin (LTC): Given that it is among the fastest and cheapest alternatives to BTC, staking LTC on StakingBonus means consistent returns but at much lower fees.

Ethereum (ETH): ETH staking probably is the most popular form of passive rewards on the blockchain after Ethereum moved to a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH): This type of investment is perfect for investors who look to take advantage of BCH's scalability and relatively lower transaction fees against Bitcoin.

Dogecoin (DOGE): As a fun, community-driven cryptocurrency, DOGE is highly rewarding, especially for more extended periods, when staked through StakingBonus.

Ripples: This ensures comfortable returns for XRP, a coin known and utilized for fast and inexpensive cross-border transactions.

TRON (TRX): TRON focuses on decentralized content creation; hence, this coin will be an exciting option to stake for those interested in taking part.

Tether (USDT): Stablecoin is pegged against the US dollar, which makes staking USDT a low-risk and stable return investment without going through the volatility that other cryptocurrencies are prone to.

Crypto trading entails the buying and selling of virtual assets with the hope of making a profit based on changes in price. It is usually much more active, hands-on compared to staking, and traders need to follow the markets all the time, analyze the trends that are forming, and make quick decisions. While it is pretty risky, it can therefore give quite significant returns if done right.

Yield farming is one of the methods to earn interest through lending or staking crypto in decentralized finance platforms. Hereby, users provide liquidity to some pools and, correspondingly, get rewards that can be very high compared with traditional investments. However, with yield farming, the risks are higher: one may suffer an impermanent loss or take hits because of changes in market conditions.

Crypto lending websites allow users to lend their digital assets to other borrowers while earning interest off it. The borrower typically provides security collateral in return, which lowers the risk for the lender. Lending is perfect for those users who want to have consistent, predictable returns without actively participating in trading or any other high-risk activity.

Running a masternode allows users to contribute to the security of specific blockchain networks and get rewards. Master nodes are resource-intensive, with many requiring a high upfront investment in hardware and cryptocurrency. They tend to pay higher rewards as well.

Non-fungible tokens are unique digital collectibles, digital art, music, or even in-game items. As one may have guessed, they are very popular because ownership of specific NFTs can appreciate over time-particularly those that are truly one-of-a-kind or highly sought after. Investing in these NFTs will yield a significant profit if the market demand continuously supports them.

Most crypto platforms maintain programs for referrals whereby their users can be rewarded for inviting others to join their sites. These are designed to reward both the referrer and the new user so that the process is rather easy and passive.

Crypto mining refers to the process in which a miner uses computer power to solve complex mathematical problems validating transactions across the blockchain network. As a way of rewarding the miners for this work, they are given newly minted tokens. Nowadays, the mining of some cryptocurrencies-like Bitcoin-already pays off, but this largely requires huge investments in hardware and electricity.

The strategy of HODL originally means a misspelling of the word ""hold,"" and it's all about buying and holding up cryptocurrency over an extended period many times on the assumption that it would surge in value over time. This strategy particularly works well in the case of an established cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Cardano, which have shown exponential growth patterns.

Sometimes, participation in an ICO, or token sale, affords access to new cryptocurrencies before they come into large exchanges. Whether this project starts attracting attention, then the value of such a token may increase significantly, hence yielding fantastic returns for early investors.

Known for its speed, Solana boasts of some of the fastest transaction times in the crypto space, making it a favorite for developers, and as the network continues to grow with new decentralized applications and NFT projects, investors remain bullish on Solana's future price.

Another key reason for Solana's popularity is its low transaction fees, which have made it more appealing to users and contributed to its widespread adoption. The number of on-chain transactions has also increased, showing that more people are using the network.

When it comes to the Solana network, many even claim that it is a better platform than Ethereum. However, although Solana is not likely to overtake Ethereum in the decentralized applications (dApp) space, it remains one of the top cryptocurrencies to consider investing in right now.

In other positive news, the Brazilian SEC recently approved the world's first Solana ETF, and if the Brazilian stock exchange, B3, follows through with its approval. This could mark the beginning of more regulated crypto investment products worldwide and might push Solana's price higher.

In terms of price performance, in the last 12 months, Solana has been one of the standout performers in the crypto space, increasing by an impressive 660%.

Crypto All-Stars - World's First-Ever Meme-Vault

Another cryptocurrency that made our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy as Bitcoin price starts its bullish momentum is Crypto All-Stars, a unique and fascinating new project that aims to collect all meme coins in one location using its ""MemeVault"". Crypto All-Stars is essentially the world's first-ever meme vault at which holders of several tokens, including PEPE, DOGE, and BONK, can lock their tokens and earn benefits in return.

It is currently in presale, and its initial stages have shown significant promise. The token has raised substantial interest, especially from younger investors who are keen on gaming tokens. If the project delivers on its promises, we could see a steady increase in value post-launch, with predictions suggesting a 50-60% rise in the first quarter of 2025.

During the presale, investors can purchase $STARS tokens at a discounted price and stake them to gain a high annual percentage yield. Currently, the annual percentage yield is 900%; however, this is a dynamic APY, which means it decreases as more tokens are staked. Although early birds will have the best chance of earning the most rewards once the MemeVault debuts, the payout for staking meme coins will be proportional to the number of $STARS tokens the holder owns.

All of the above have raised analysts' expectations for the Crypto All Stars token.

So far, the Crypto All-Stars presale has raised over $1.5 million, with a big buzz in the crypto industry regarding this project.

Dogecoin, the original meme coin that was launched in 2013, is an open-source peer-to-peer digital currency that has gained huge popularity in recent years.

Overall, Dogecoin has stayed relatively stable this year despite the volatile cryptocurrency industry. One $DOGE is currently trading at $0.1092 per DOGE/USD and several crypto experts are predicting it could see gains up to $0.20 by the end of 2024 if Bitcoin regains momentum. This is one of the reasons why Dogecoin has made our list as one of the best crypto to buy as Bitcoin prices start pushing higher. It remains a solid choice for those looking for a long-term meme coin investment with mainstream appeal.

Cardano - Science-Based Open-Source Third Generation Blockchain

Cardano is a top-notch blockchain platform that prioritizes scalability, sustainability, and security. It's one of the most well-known proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, and it is led by a strong development team focused on peer-reviewed research. This third-generation blockchain platform, known for its rigorous and scientific development strategy, strongly focuses on interoperability and sustainability. It uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is much more energy-efficient than the older Proof-of-Work (PoW) model used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Although some critics say Cardano's progress has been slow, its methodical approach ensures that its development is both robust and sustainable. Recent upgrades, such as Hydra, have improved scalability and interoperability. Also, the Voltaire upgrade, which was introduced in December 2023, has further decentralized the network by adding a treasury system and community governance. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, the Chang upgrade is set to bring even more advancements to the platform.

Over the years, Cardano has steadily built its infrastructure and community by prioritizing secure, scalable, and interoperable blockchain solutions. A key milestone was the Alonzo upgrade, which introduced smart contracts and helped drive the growth of decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform.

Cardano's price has been relatively stable throughout 2024, hovering around the $0.25-$0.35 range. It must be noted that Cardano's price performance throughout 2024 was slightly disappointing, with a YTD of -35%. However, many crypto analysts believe this provides a good buying opportunity to buy Cardano as they expect ADA to reach $0.50 by early 2025, especially if the platform continues to expand its ecosystem.

At the time of writing, one Cardano is currently trading for $0.38 per token, with an impressive increase of over 26% since the beginning of September. Further, despite the disappointing performance since the beginning of the year, Cardaono's YoY return stands at 56.38%.

With the above in mind, Cardano might be among the best cryptocurrencies to buy for investors looking for a long-term crypto investment. Notably, one of Cardano's strengths is its ability to enable seamless communication with other blockchains and legacy financial systems, making cross-chain transactions possible and encouraging wider adoption. These features make Cardano among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in as Bitcoin starts rising.

Also, several experts have predicted that as decentralized gambling becomes more popular, Mega Dice could experience further growth, potentially doubling in value by mid-2025.

The native token, $DICE, is currently in presale and offers 35% of its 420 million token supply to early adopters. $DICE can be utilized on the Mega Dice casino and sports betting platform to gain access to unique incentives and games. It generates significant yields when staked for varied periods and can be used to purchase limited-edition NFTs. Mega Dice also offers an airdrop campaign and a referral program to further encourage investment.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced significant shifts in 2024, driven by several macroeconomic factors such as inflation concerns, regulatory developments, and market liquidity.

Bitcoin has recently soared to $63,000, boosted by favorable inflation data and predictions of a 50 basis point Fed rate drop. Over the past month, BTC gained 15%, rising from $53,000 on September 7 to its currency price of around $63,000. A key reason for the Bitcoin price increase lately was MicroStrategy's $1.1 billion acquisition of Bitcoin in September, which provided a boost for BTC price.

Still, despite MicroStrategy's $1.1 billion acquisition of Bitcoin, the price is still 20% lower than its all-time high of $73,780. A possible downside objective of $53,000 is in play, although the ongoing rally is more likely to continue, with volatility expected to rise as the US election approaches.

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin's price has made an impressive upward move, although it is currently facing a key resistance level at $64,200.

Looking forward, the bullish sentiment is slowly building up in the BTC market. October is historically an extremely positive month for Bitcoin and the crypto market, which can push BTC prices even higher next month. Lastly, the US elections could have a huge impact on the Bitcoin price. Some even say that regardless of who wins the US elections.

Summary - What's the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now?

In sum, Bitcoin's bullish movement can be the beginning of a long trend, especially when taking into account the recent Fed rate cut and the upcoming US elections.

This positive sentiment opens up opportunities to explore other cryptocurrencies with strong growth potential. Solid cryptocurrencies like Solana and Dogecoin or a high-risk, high-reward option like Memebet, Crypto All-Stars, and Pepe Unchained can help you find the perfect combination for building your crypto portfolio.

For those willing to take a chance on meme coins or newer tokens like Crypto All-Stars, Memebet, and Pepe Unchained, the potential for short-term gains is high. Meanwhile, more established projects like Cardano and Solana offer stability and long-term growth prospects. As always, it's essential to do your research and consider your risk tolerance when making investment decisions.

Ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,636.77 as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price the cryptocurrency reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $316.10 billion. It's up 66% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 70% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $88.31 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $307 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $291 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,636.77.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 66% year over year, compared to a 143% gain for bitcoin.

You might be more comfortable using online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Interactive Brokers, Webull, and Robinhood.

Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal have options for buying ETH. Cryptocurrency ATMs also allow for direct purchases.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

Why Ethereum Holders Are Jumping Ship To Binance Coin (BNB) and Cutoshi (CUTO),https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-ethereum-holders-are-jumping-ship-to-binance-coin-bnb-and-cutoshi-cuto/,2024-09-25,Crypto News Flash,"Early Ethereum investors made a fortune when the cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $4,362 in May 2021. However, many are starting to jump ship to Binance Coin (BNB) and Cutoshi (CUTO) as the competition in the layer-1 blockchain space heats up.

Notably, Cutoshi (CUTO) is still in its presale phase, offering Ethereum holders an opportunity to get in at the ground level before the anticipated 30x launch. Let's explore the alternative options that lure Ethereum holders away from the once-dominant cryptocurrency.

Ethereum is showing signs of losing its luster in the current market landscape. The blockchain that ignited the DeFi boom of 2021 now seems to be falling behind as other Layer 1 networks offer more competitive features and lower transaction fees.

Notably, the ETH/BTC ratio has plummeted to levels not seen since April 2021. This downtrend paints a grim picture, suggesting investors increasingly favor Bitcoin as ""sound money"" or altcoins just beginning to gain traction like Cutoshi.

While Ethereum's developers tout upcoming improvements like the Pectra upgrade, the time it takes to implement these changes is causing concern among investors. When Ethereum 2.0 will launch remains a mystery, and many fear that the network will lose its relevance.

The recent approval of an Ethereum ETF was widely thought to be a huge catalyst for the cryptocurrency, especially with the Bitcoin ETF resulting in new all-time highs. However, the lackluster response from institutions reaffirms the sentiment that Ethereum may be losing its edge.

From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum is climbing an ascending trendline, with the $2,800 level waiting as the next battleground for bulls and bears. Should bulls win, it would signal a new higher low and the potential for a bullish trend reversal to begin.

Founded in 2017, Binance has rapidly established itself as the dominant centralized crypto exchange. Boasting a staggering daily trading volume of over $13 billion across 1,662 markets, it has cemented its status as the go-to platform for crypto traders worldwide.

The exchange's offerings extend beyond standard trading services. Binance has developed a comprehensive ecosystem that includes a launchpad for new projects, an NFT marketplace, and its own blockchain, the Binance Smart Chain. This comprehensive approach was pivotal in propelling Binance Coin (BNB) to an impressive all-time high of $690 in April 2021.

However, BNB's price would decline to just $200 in the following months as the SEC and DoJ initiated investigations into Binance's compliance with US regulations. This uncertainty caused a widespread panic among investors, leading to the price drop.

But as the saying goes, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" Binance emerged from these regulatory challenges and continues to grow its user base and offerings. The price of BNB has bounced back to make a new all-time high of $715, with the current dip at $607 offering a potential buying opportunity.

A daily close above the $700 level would allow price discovery to begin, with no resistance levels stopping Binance Coin from potentially hitting four-figure prices. Keeping an eye on this level and regulatory developments will be crucial for any trader or investor looking to capitalize on BNB's potential.

At first glance, Cutoshi's Lucky Cat mascot might seem like just another cute face in the memecoin space. But dig deeper, and you'll find a sophisticated ecosystem that pays homage to Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of decentralization while bringing good fortune to its users.

At the heart of Cutoshi's ecosystem lies a multi-chain DEX designed to simplify cross-chain transactions. By enabling seamless asset swaps across different blockchain networks, Cutoshi aims to reduce entry barriers for newcomers to the DeFi space.

Taking a leaf out of Binance's book of comprehensive services, Cutoshi elevates the concept of yield farming to new heights. By gamifying the process, Cutoshi transforms what's typically a passive activity into an interactive experience of quests, points, and rewards.

Cutoshi's commitment to education is evident in its comprehensive learning platform, the Cutoshi Academy. By offering courses ranging from basic blockchain concepts to advanced trading strategies, Cutoshi aims to create a more informed and confident user base.

Cutoshi plans to integrate NFTs into its decision-making process using a novel approach to governance. This innovative use of NFTs could create a more engaged community with a vested interest in the project's long-term success.

The CUTO token is listed at just $0.015 during phase one of an ongoing presale event. Such a ground-floor entry point offers maximum upside potential to early investors who believe in the project's vision of revolutionizing DeFi through a unique blend of meme culture appeal and robust utility.",https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2024-09-25T115308.138.jpg,0.03529411764705892
"Qubetics Layer-1 Ecosystem: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana in One Blockchain - Blockonomi",https://blockonomi.com/qubetics-where-bitcoin-meets-ethereum-and-solana-in-a-unified-ecosystem/,2024-09-25,Blockonomi,"The main problem facing cryptocurrency is that blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin do not easily interact, which leads to high costs, slow transactions, and a fragmented system. Overall, the inability of integration limits the growth and potential of the blockchain sector. Qubetics ($TICS) fixes this issue by unifying Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin into a single ecosystem. Qubetics simplifies transaction transfer, reduces costs, and increases efficiency through smart contracts and cross-chain bridges.

Moreover, the Qubetics presale is launching on September 27, which gives you the chance to buy $TICS tokens at a reasonable price. Read on further to unveil the real potential of Qubetics and how it's revolutionising the cryptocurrency market!

A blockchain system's primary structure is known as Layer-1 blockchain. It manages every aspect, including security and transactions. Blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, often function independently, and their potential may be limited by this siloed nature. Qubetics addresses this issue by bringing various networks together in a single place. As a result, transferring funds between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana is simple and safe, strengthening the blockchain experience overall.

By connecting these well-known networks, Qubetics addresses interoperability, one of the main problems with blockchain. For instance, this Layer-1 solution enables users on the Qubetics platform to transfer funds between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana instantly and securely. As a result, each blockchain becomes interconnected and can profit from the advantages of the others.

The cryptocurrency market is growing quickly; however, fragmentation across different networks frequently causes transaction difficulties and slow development. To address these problems, Qubetics has developed its Layer-1 ecosystem. By offering a unified network, Qubetics ensures that data and assets move between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana uninterruptedly, improving both transaction speed and latency. This simplified approach reduces inefficiencies and creates new opportunities for investors and developers as well.

This unified approach provides several benefits:

Beyond simple transaction transfers, Qubetics' vision opens the door to advanced smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and even cross-chain DeFi projects by combining Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. Developers can create and deploy apps that utilize the best features of all three ecosystems without having to worry about compatibility issues, which is extremely important in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Qubetics' Layer-1 architecture provides an ecosystem that can adapt to changing needs, leading the way for future advancements in blockchain technology.

The presale of Qubetics' $TICS tokens is set for September 27, giving early investors a chance to participate in this game-changing project. By investing, you're not just buying a token -- you're supporting a vision of unified blockchain ecosystems that will shape the future of the cryptocurrency market.

The way that Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin may cooperate in an integrated framework is being redefined by Qubetics. Its Layer-1 blockchain makes it the best platform for the Bitcoin market's future by providing quicker transactions, better security, and cheaper costs. It is time to reserve your spot in a project that intends to completely change blockchain technology as we know it, as the Qubetics presale approaches near.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Qubetics-Featured-Image.png,0.07450980392156858

Ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,644.63 as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price the cryptocurrency reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Ethereum launched in 2015 and is the most popular altcoin. Along with bitcoin, it has become one of the most recognizable forms of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum prices

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $318.43 billion. It's up 66% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 71% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $83.98 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $297 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,644.63.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 138% year over year, compared to a 66% gain for ethereum.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.0980392156862746
"Opportunities Abound at Intersection of Traditional Finance, Digital Assets, Energy | Chief Investment Officer",https://www.ai-cio.com/news/opportunities-abound-at-intersection-of-traditional-finance-digital-assets-energy/,2024-09-23,Chief Investment Officer,"The CIO of Panama's sovereign wealth fund writes that the push for regulatory clarity and innovation are strong in a 'dynamic, yet challenging, frontier' market.

At last month's Wyoming Blockchain Symposium enlightening discussion unfolded about the evolving landscape of blockchain and digital assets. The conversations not only highlighted opportunities, but also the stark realities institutional investors face in this relatively nascent sector.

A major theme was the impact of current regulatory approaches on the cryptocurrency industry. The prevailing method of ""regulation through enforcement"" has proven to be more stifling than nurturing. For institutional investors, this underscores the need for a strategic shift toward clearer, more consistent regulatory frameworks to protect investments and support sector growth. The stability of blockchain investments and, by extension, digital assets, significantly hinges on future regulatory clarity.

Skybridge Alternatives, or SALT Conferences, and by Payward Inc., better known as Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, hosted the symposium.

For institutional investors looking to engage with this sector, several pathways exist:

Direct investment in digital tokens allows institutions to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum directly on digital asset exchanges. Futures are also available for a select number of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, providing opportunities for risk hedging and income generation strategies without owning the assets outright.

Investments through exchange-traded funds represent a more ""sanitized"" method of investing in cryptocurrencies, predominantly available for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The recent growth in Bitcoin ETFs, capturing about 14% of its total market capitalization (according to CoinMarketCap), underscores the stability of the asset.

However, as with direct investment in digital tokens, ETFs face custody challenges. Typically, a digital asset exchange would use ""cold wallets"" -- crypto wallets not connected to the internet -- for enhanced security against hacking. This is not very efficient due to their susceptibility to human error. This scenario has prompted concerns about the risks associated with the concentration of custodial services. In the U.S., some members of Congress advocate for allowing traditional banks to offer custody services to mitigate these risks.

For asset allocators, investment through private funds that focus on cryptocurrencies may be more appealing. These funds largely operate like hedge funds, actively investing in so-called Layer-1 assets, focusing on what they consider attractive, regardless of the underlying ""use case"" of the digital asset.

Venture capital presents another avenue for investing in this asset class, directly or through funds. The range of venture investing is broad: One option is investing at the blockchain level (below Layer 1, or at Layer 0) for enhanced interoperability and communication, or in supporting other digital assets in Layer 2 and even Layer 3, the application layer where developers build actual applications using the underlying frameworks provided by Layers 1 and 2.

These strategies, while potentially rewarding, come with their own idiosyncratic risks.

Tokenization (the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain) seeks to streamline processes and reduce costs and risks associated with intermediaries, holding great promise for both decentralized finance [DeFi] and traditional finance [TradFi]. For instance, the adoption of tokenization in DeFi showcases tokenization's revolutionary approach to bypassing traditional financial systems, whereas in TradFi, it integrates with existing financial structures to enhance operational efficiency. While tokenization's potential for efficiency and scalability could be rewarding to users and investors in both verticals, the lack of supportive policy and definitive regulatory guidelines poses a risk to the full realization of these benefits.

One of the least-discussed areas of digital asset investing is energy infrastructure for digital asset miners. Opportunities here are touted as pursuing global sustainability goals, yet conflict with the insatiable need for high-power computing capabilities, especially in the face of artificial intelligence power consumption. Global demand for mining infrastructure is growing, which makes owning and operating sustainable power sources crucial to leverage zero-carbon energy sources like nuclear power.

Finally, the debate about central bank digital currencies and the role of digital assets in national economies underscores the need for countries to future-proof their monetary systems. For institutional investors, these developments could dictate new norms in liquidity, risk and asset management.

When considering asset allocation to the digital asset space, a sensible approach might be a ""decile drawdown"" allocation to cryptocurrencies. Taking 10% of your worst historical (pick how far back) 12-month return and using that as a maximum allocation to the asset class could be prudent. For instance, if your worst 12-month return has been 10%, then 1% could be your maximum allocation to crypto assets. Of course, this allocation, however small, must be weighed against the liquidity profile and risk appetite of the asset allocator.

In the end, discussions at the conference underscored that the intersection of traditional finance, digital assets, energy and blockchain technology is bustling with opportunities, yet fraught with unanswered regulatory questions. The push for clarity and innovation is strong, reflecting a dynamic, yet challenging, frontier for those navigating this space.

How Bitcoin Casinos Operate in the USA

Crypto gambling sites operate on the cutting-edge technology of blockchain, which provides improved privacy and security for users. Blockchain functions as a decentralized ledger that verifies transactions, ensuring that each transaction is secure and transparent. This technology is a game-changer for online casinos, as it enhances security against fraud and allows players to verify the fairness of game results.

One of the standout features of Bitcoin casinos is their use of blockchain technology for decentralized transactions. This ensures that all transactions are secure, efficient, and free from the excessive fees typically associated with traditional banking methods. Players can enjoy a seamless gambling experience, knowing that their funds and personal information are well-protected.

Another significant advantage is the level of anonymity that Bitcoin casinos offer. Players can gamble without disclosing personal information, which is a major draw for those who value their privacy. The blockchain ledger records every transaction, ensuring accountability and security while maintaining player anonymity. This combination of transparency and privacy is what sets Bitcoin casinos apart from traditional online casinos.

Overall, the operation of Bitcoin casinos in the USA is characterized by enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency. Leveraging blockchain technology, these casinos ensure a secure and fair gaming environment, attracting an increasing number of players. Exploring the world of Bitcoin casinos reveals innovative operations and a unique online gambling experience.

Legal Landscape of Bitcoin Casinos in the US

The legal landscape of Bitcoin casinos in the US is a complex and evolving field. Cryptocurrency gambling is legal in the US, with no laws explicitly banning it. However, the operational legality of Bitcoin casinos remains uncertain due to the lack of specific regulations. This creates a paradox where Bitcoin casinos can legally exist, but their operations are not clearly defined by law.

Currently, only seven states in the USA authorize online casinos, including Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey. Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey are notable states that allow online gambling, making them key locations for legal online casinos. Despite the limited number of states with legal online gambling, offshore online casinos are popular among US players, as there are no laws explicitly prohibiting their use, except in Washington state. Additionally, the rise of the online casino industry has attracted many players seeking entertainment.

Players can access Bitcoin casinos in different parts of the USA, often bypassing geo-blocking restrictions using VPNs. The legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the US remains ambiguous, with different agencies categorizing them variously as securities, commodities, or property. This ambiguity adds to the complexity of the legal landscape, making it essential for players to stay informed about the latest regulations and guidelines.

Navigating the legal landscape of Bitcoin casinos in the USA requires a keen understanding of both state and federal laws. While the lack of explicit bans allows for some flexibility, players must remain cautious and informed to ensure they are gambling legally and responsibly. As the legal environment continues to evolve, staying updated on regulations will be crucial for anyone interested in Bitcoin gambling.

Advantages of Choosing Bitcoin Casinos in the US

Choosing Bitcoin casinos in the USA comes with numerous advantages that traditional online casinos can't offer. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced privacy. Transactions made with Bitcoin are typically completed within minutes, in contrast to traditional methods that can take days. This speed extends to withdrawals as well, allowing players to access their winnings almost instantly.

Another major advantage is the lower transaction fees associated with Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. Unlike traditional banking methods that often come with hefty fees, Bitcoin transactions are generally minimal or nonexistent. This makes Bitcoin casinos a more cost-effective option for players, allowing them to keep more of their winnings.

Bitcoin casinos also offer unique bonuses and promotions specifically for cryptocurrency users. These bonuses often surpass those available at traditional fiat casinos, providing players with better incentives and enhancing the overall gambling experience. Additionally, the global nature of Bitcoin means players can access these casinos from anywhere in the world without worrying about currency restrictions.

Privacy, speed, lower fees, and attractive bonuses make Bitcoin casinos appealing to many USA players. Leveraging cryptocurrency benefits, these casinos offer a superior gambling experience tailored to modern players' needs and preferences, whether seeking instant payouts, enhanced security, or better bonuses.

Selecting a Reliable Bitcoin Casino in the USA

Selecting a reliable Bitcoin casino in the USA requires careful consideration of several factors. Players should prioritize well-established platforms with a solid reputation, robust security measures, and a diverse range of games.

The following subsections cover the importance of reputation and trustworthiness, essential security measures to consider, and the variety of games that enhance the overall gaming experience.

❇️ Reputation and Trustworthiness

When choosing a Bitcoin casino, reputation and trustworthiness are paramount. User feedback is essential in discerning the reliability and transparency of a casino. Positive reviews and a solid reputation indicate that a casino has consistently met the expectations of its players. Good casinos actively learn from past mistakes and improve their services, which is a sign of a trustworthy platform.

Players should also check for trust banners, certificates, or documentation links at the bottom of a casino's webpage as these are indicators of a reliable and transparent operation. It's also wise to look for well-established platforms with a history of positive reviews and minimal justified complaints. This helps ensure that the casino is not only reputable but also responsive to player concerns.

By prioritizing reputation and trustworthiness, players can enjoy a safer and more enjoyable gambling experience.

❇️ Security Measures

Security is critical for safe and anonymous gambling. Top Bitcoin casinos typically implement SSL encryption to safeguard data transmitted between players and their servers, ensuring that all player information remains private and secure. Additionally, most player funds are stored in cold storage, which is offline and thus less vulnerable to cyber threats.

Another key security feature is two-factor authentication, which provides an added layer of security for player accounts. These measures are crucial for creating a secure gaming environment and protecting users from potential threats. By verifying that a casino employs these security mechanisms, players can ensure their data and funds are well-protected.

Overall, selecting a Bitcoin casino with robust security features is essential for a safe and enjoyable gambling experience. From SSL encryption to cold storage and two-factor authentication, these measures help ensure that players can focus on their gaming without worrying about security issues.

Game Variety

A diverse range of games is a key factor in enhancing the overall gaming experience in Bitcoin casinos. Players should look for casinos that offer a wide variety of games, including slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, progressive jackpots, free spins, table games, live dealer games, video poker, dice games, bingo, keno, and lotteries. This variety ensures that players have plenty of options to choose from and can enjoy different types of games based on their preferences.

It's also important that the games play smoothly on all devices and ideally offer demo versions to enhance user engagement. Ensuring a wide variety of game offerings and maintaining high gameplay quality are crucial for an engaging and satisfying gambling experience. By choosing a casino with a diverse game selection, players can enjoy a richer and more varied gaming adventure.

Overall, the variety of games available at a Bitcoin casino is a significant factor in its appeal. Whether you prefer slot games, live dealer games, or classic table games, a diverse game selection ensures that there is something for everyone.

Popular Games at Bitcoin Casinos US

Bitcoin casinos in the US offer a diverse range of gaming experiences that are popular among players. From slots and video poker to live dealer games and provably fair games, there is no shortage of options to choose from in online bitcoin casinos.

The following subsections explore popular game categories like slot games, live dealer games, and provably fair games, highlighting what makes them so appealing.

Slot Games

Slot games are a major draw at Bitcoin casinos, offering a variety of themes and features to keep players entertained. Players can find a range of slot games with themes ranging from adventure to classic fruit machines, ensuring that there is something to suit every taste. The appeal of slot games lies in their simplicity and the thrill of potentially hitting a big win with just a few spins.

Many Bitcoin casinos also offer progressive jackpot slots, where the prize pool increases with each bet placed, creating the opportunity for massive payouts. Additionally, players often enjoy free spins and other bonuses tied to slot games, further enhancing their gaming experience.

With such a wide variety of options, it's no wonder that slot games are among the most popular at Bitcoin casinos.

Live Dealer Games

Live dealer games provide a realistic casino experience, allowing players to interact with real dealers in real-time.

Provably Fair Games

Provably fair games are a cornerstone of Bitcoin casinos, ensuring that players can trust the fairness and transparency of game outcomes. These games use cryptographic algorithms to guarantee unbiased results, allowing players to verify the fairness of each game. This level of transparency is a significant advantage over traditional online casinos, where players must trust that the games are fair without any way to verify it themselves.

Reputable random number generators (RNGs) are utilized in crypto casinos to ensure unbiased game results. The algorithms used in provably fair games allow players to check and confirm that the outcomes have not been manipulated, reinforcing fairness for players. This transparency builds trust and confidence in the gaming experience, making provably fair games a popular choice among Bitcoin casino players.

How to Invest in Crypto Without Buying Coins,https://techbullion.com/how-to-invest-in-crypto-without-buying-coins/,2024-09-23,TechBullion,"Smart ways to invest in crypto without buying coins: diversify your portfolio

Cryptocurrency, since its inception, has rapidly evolved from a niche digital asset to a mainstream financial tool with the potential to revolutionize various industries, particularly finance. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have gained substantial value and attention, attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, investing in crypto isn't limited to purchasing coins directly. In fact, for many people, investing without buying actual cryptocurrencies offers a safer, more regulated, and sometimes more convenient way to gain exposure to this rapidly growing market. In this article, we will explore various strategies and avenues to invest in cryptocurrency without actually buying and holding coins.

Why Invest in Crypto Without Buying Coins?

Before diving into the methods, it's essential to understand why someone might prefer to invest in crypto without directly purchasing the coins:

1. Volatility and Risk:

Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Bitcoin, for example, has seen multiple cycles of meteoric rise followed by sharp crashes. For conservative investors, such volatility may pose too much risk.

2. Regulatory Concerns:

Cryptocurrencies exist in a gray regulatory area in many countries. Directly holding and trading cryptocurrencies can expose investors to uncertainties about future government actions, taxation, and legal frameworks.

3. Security Concerns:

While blockchain technology is highly secure, the same cannot always be said for crypto exchanges or wallets. Numerous high-profile hacks and thefts have occurred over the years, making some investors wary of storing their funds in crypto wallets.

4. Technical Complexity:

Buying, storing, and managing crypto requires technical knowledge, which can be a barrier to entry for some investors. This includes understanding wallets, private keys, public keys, and security protocols.

Given these challenges, alternative methods of gaining exposure to the crypto market can be appealing. Let's explore several ways to invest in cryptocurrency without owning the actual assets.

1. Cryptocurrency Stocks

One of the easiest ways to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market is by investing in companies that are directly or indirectly involved in the crypto space. Many publicly traded companies are tied to the crypto economy, either by holding large amounts of cryptocurrency, developing blockchain technology, or providing infrastructure for crypto operations. Here are some popular categories of crypto-related stocks:

a. Crypto Mining Companies

Cryptocurrency mining involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. Miners are rewarded with newly minted coins. Some companies have built massive operations around mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and they are publicly traded.

Riot Blockchain (RIOT): A company that focuses on Bitcoin mining, utilizing large-scale mining operations. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA): Another major player in the crypto mining sector, focusing on Bitcoin mining with significant investment in mining hardware.

By investing in these companies, you are indirectly investing in cryptocurrency, as their profitability and stock prices are highly correlated with the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

b. Crypto Exchange Companies

Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. These exchanges generate significant revenue through transaction fees, and as the popularity of cryptocurrencies rises, so too does the profitability of exchanges.

Coinbase (COIN): The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase allows users to buy and sell a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Its stock price is closely tied to crypto market activity. Robinhood Markets (HOOD): While Robinhood is primarily known for its stock and options trading, it has also moved into the crypto space, offering trading for various cryptocurrencies. c. Blockchain Technology Companies

Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology has widespread applications across industries like finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. Investing in companies that are developing or utilizing blockchain technology can provide exposure to the crypto space without the direct risk of holding coins.

IBM (IBM): IBM is heavily invested in blockchain solutions for businesses, offering enterprise-grade blockchain platforms and services. Square (now Block, Inc.) (SQ): Square is a payments company that has integrated Bitcoin into its Cash App, and its CEO, Jack Dorsey, is a vocal advocate of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. 2. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Mutual Funds

ETFs and mutual funds provide a diversified way to invest in the crypto space without buying individual coins. These funds pool investors' money and allocate it across various assets related to cryptocurrencies, such as blockchain technology, crypto mining, and companies involved in the crypto economy.

a. Blockchain ETFs

Blockchain ETFs invest in companies that are engaged in blockchain technology development. These ETFs do not directly invest in cryptocurrencies but in businesses that could benefit from the adoption of blockchain technology.

Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK): This ETF holds companies like Nvidia, Square, and other firms involved in blockchain technology. Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN): BLCN invests in companies that are committed to blockchain technology and innovation. b. Bitcoin and Crypto ETFs

Although direct Bitcoin ETFs have been slow to gain approval in some regions, there are futures-based ETFs and some that invest in crypto-related companies.

ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO): This ETF invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without actually holding the digital asset. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): GBTC is a trust that holds Bitcoin, and investors can buy shares in the trust through the stock market. While not a true ETF, it functions similarly by providing exposure to Bitcoin's price fluctuations. 3. Crypto Futures and Options

Futures and options contracts are another way to invest in cryptocurrencies without buying coins directly. These financial instruments allow you to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but without holding the actual asset.

a. Bitcoin Futures

Bitcoin futures are contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price at a specific future date. By trading futures, you can gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movement, whether up or down, without owning the asset itself.

Futures trading is available on platforms like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which offers regulated Bitcoin futures. However, it's essential to understand that futures trading can be risky due to leverage and market volatility.

b. Crypto Options

Options are contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a specified expiration date. Bitcoin options are available on both centralized and decentralized platforms, allowing investors to speculate on price movements.

Some platforms, like Deribit or CME, offer Bitcoin and Ethereum options trading. As with futures, options trading requires a good understanding of derivatives and can involve significant risk.

4. Crypto Lending and Interest Accounts

Crypto lending platforms allow you to earn interest on your funds without directly buying and holding cryptocurrencies. These platforms work by lending your money to cryptocurrency traders or businesses, and in return, you earn interest on your loan. Essentially, this is akin to earning passive income without the need to own or manage cryptocurrencies yourself.

a. Crypto Savings Accounts

Some platforms offer savings accounts where you can deposit traditional currencies (like USD) and earn interest based on cryptocurrency loans or investments. These platforms often offer higher interest rates compared to traditional banks, as the funds are used to provide liquidity to the crypto markets.

BlockFi: BlockFi allows users to earn interest on their deposits in cryptocurrencies or traditional currencies. Nexo: Nexo offers a similar service, allowing users to earn interest on deposited funds without holding cryptocurrencies themselves.

While these platforms offer an easy way to gain exposure to crypto's growth, they also come with risks, including the possibility of defaults on crypto loans and the volatility of crypto-related assets.

5. Crypto Index Funds

Crypto index funds are similar to traditional index funds but focused on cryptocurrencies. These funds pool together multiple cryptocurrencies or crypto-related assets to create a diversified portfolio. Investors in crypto index funds do not need to buy individual cryptocurrencies, as the fund does that for them.

a. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund

The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund holds the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Investors in this fund gain exposure to the broader crypto market, including assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, without directly purchasing any cryptocurrency.

b. Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund

This fund holds a basket of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Grayscale's approach allows investors to gain diversified exposure to major cryptocurrencies, reducing the risk associated with individual assets.

6. Staking and Yield Farming on Traditional Finance Platforms

Staking and yield farming are commonly associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, where users can lock their cryptocurrencies in exchange for rewards or yield. However, some traditional financial platforms are starting to offer similar services, allowing investors to gain exposure to crypto yields without directly buying coins.

a. Staking via Financial Institutions

Traditional financial institutions, like banks or crypto-friendly fintech companies, are beginning to offer staking services for cryptocurrencies. These institutions manage the technical aspects of staking, allowing users to earn rewards without holding or managing the coins themselves.

Swissquote: A Swiss online bank that offers staking services for major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum 2.0 and Tezos. 7. Investing in Crypto Infrastructure

Investing in the infrastructure that supports the crypto ecosystem is another way to gain exposure to the space. Crypto infrastructure includes hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers that facilitate the growth and expansion of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency networks.

a. Hardware Companies

Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) produce the high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) used for cryptocurrency mining. Investing in these companies can give you indirect exposure to the crypto market, as demand for their products is driven by the growth of the crypto industry.

b. Payment Processors

Payment processors like Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL) are beginning to embrace cryptocurrency by allowing users to buy, sell, and use crypto for transactions. As crypto adoption grows, these companies stand to benefit, making them an attractive investment for those looking for crypto exposure without buying coins.

Investing in cryptocurrency without buying coins is not only possible but offers various methods that suit different risk appetites, goals, and preferences. Whether through stocks, ETFs, futures, or interest-bearing accounts, there are plenty of ways to gain exposure to the burgeoning crypto economy while avoiding the direct purchase of digital assets.

Each method comes with its own set of risks and benefits. For example, investing in crypto-related stocks offers regulatory oversight but ties performance to the broader stock market. On the other hand, futures and options trading can provide more direct exposure to crypto prices but with higher complexity and risk.

Ultimately, investors should consider their risk tolerance, investment goals, and familiarity with financial instruments when choosing how to invest in the cryptocurrency space without buying coins. As the market continues to mature, more opportunities will likely emerge, providing even greater flexibility and safety for investors seeking exposure to this exciting and transformative technology.

2. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin (BTC), currently priced at $62,774.42 with a market cap of $1.2 trillion, remains the leading cryptocurrency since its inception in 2009 by the mysterious figure Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin's decentralized, blockchain-based transaction verification system has set a standard for digital security. However, it faces criticism for its energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism, raising environmental concerns. Additionally, Bitcoin's scalability challenges and slower transaction speeds compared to newer cryptocurrencies have led to debates about its long-term utility. Despite these concerns, Bitcoin remains dominant, holding 57.29% of the total crypto market, and continues to be a primary asset in the digital currency world.

3. Ethereum (ETH)

With a price of $2,440.11 and a market cap of $293.7 billion, Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Launched in 2015, Ethereum pioneered the introduction of smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to thrive on its blockchain. Today, Ethereum hosts over 4,400 dApps, making it a critical platform in the blockchain ecosystem. In 2023, Ethereum significantly shifted from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, greatly reducing its energy consumption and making it a greener alternative to Bitcoin. Its blockchain functionality and commitment to innovation continue to set Ethereum apart.

4. Tether (USDT)

With a market capitalization of $118.4 billion, Tether (USDT) is the most widely used stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, pegged to the US dollar. This peg provides stability in a highly volatile market, making USDT a go-to choice for traders seeking a haven during market fluctuations. Tether is primarily used as a medium of exchange, allowing users to move funds between exchanges without being exposed to the price volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Despite its utility, Tether has faced scrutiny over its reserves, with critics questioning whether it holds sufficient assets to back its tokens. Nevertheless, with a market cap exceeding $80 billion, Tether remains a key player in the stablecoin ecosystem, offering liquidity and stability across global markets.

5. Binance Coin (BNB)

BNB, priced at $558.96 with a market cap of $81.6 billion, is the native token of Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Originally launched on the Ethereum network, BNB now operates on its own Binance blockchain. The token offers a variety of use cases, including discounted fees for users on the Binance platform. However, Binance has faced significant regulatory scrutiny, including a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023 for alleged securities violations. Despite these challenges, BNB remains a key player in the crypto world, thanks to its integration with Binance's vast ecosystem.

6. Solana (SOL)

Solana, with a price of $139.64 and a market cap of $65.4 billion, is a rising star in the cryptocurrency world, launching in 2020. Its blockchain is designed to compete with Ethereum by supporting smart contracts, dApps, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). What sets Solana apart is its hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history consensus mechanisms, which make transactions faster and cheaper than Ethereum's. However, Solana has faced multiple network outages since 2022, including a 19-hour downtime in February 2023, raising concerns about its stability. While Solana shows promise, improving network reliability will be crucial to its success.

Final Words

As the cryptocurrency market expands and advances, the right investments can offer both stability and growth potential. Established coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, and Solana have proven their worth, each offering unique scalability, innovation, and market presence advantages. However, Qubetics $(TICS) stands out as a highly promising newcomer for investors seeking the next big opportunity. With its innovative Web3 ecosystem, upcoming presale, and unique features such as gasless transactions, Qubetics presents a compelling reason for those looking to invest in the future of blockchain technology.

In 2008, the first cryptocurrency called bitcoin (BTC) was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in a white paper. Being digital gold, it operates on a decentralized network that doesn't require intermediaries during financial transactions. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $60,920.43 and has hit record highs of over $72,000 thus making it an investment instrument as well as a store of value.

Blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent transactions among peers; this is the same technology that supports bitcoin. It has more sophisticated features than any other cryptos but they still lag behind in terms of wide-spread usage across different networks which may take time before transactions are confirmed.

It's gradually gaining recognition as an inflation hedge.

Created in 2013 as a playful Bitcoin clone, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the brainchild of Billy Markus (IBM) and Jackson Palmer (Adobe). Their mascot is a Shiba inu dog. Such approaches are responsible for the current value of 0.1072 dollars per one unit making it grow its worth over time thus ensuring that it remains relevant within the cryptocurrency industry.

In essence, this digital currency uses the Scrypt algorithm that is based on Litecoin technology which allows for fast and low cost transactions. Additionally, at first Dogecoin was impracticable but now has become famous and also collects big enthusiastic supporters who are sometimes called as ""Doge Army.""

There is no other coin like Dogecoin that can be compared to P2P and open source crypto because they do not usually have end point cases. It is not only technology that positions the firm in the market but also unity of interests, collaborations and alliances. The best examples of such partnerships are found in Mr Beast and Mark Rober's TeamSeas project implemented through DogeCoin Foundation to show their concern for social issues.

Dogecoin might be growing because:

In the year 2024, Dogecoin may lead the next bull market but not just through any other digital currencies rather by combining technology with community support and social media like no other coin does.

In 2016 Gavin Wood, also co-founder of Ethereum created Polkadot for building a decentralized web to own personal data publicly or privately. It went public in August 2020 under DOT as its native currency.

Central relay chains and user-created para chains make up this platform which enables seamless transfer of data as well as assets between different chains without intermediaries.

Polkadot is among the top 20 cryptos with approximately $8.825 billion market cap.

According to future positions made available, Avalanche is the best crypto for bull run 2024. Even now AVAX remains a major force in digital finance owing to solid technology underlying its growth strategies.

To choose which cryptos will be best to invest in during a bull run there are some key factors that need to be taken into consideration so as not only increase potential gains but also manage risks effectively. To make this selection easier following are some important things you should watch out for:

Cryptocurrency can be bought or sold without causing significant changes in prices due to high liquidity levels. A liquid market makes getting into or out of positions easier allowing flexibility and reducing the risk of being trapped in an illiquid asset during downturns.

Appreciating earlier performance of this cryptocurrency could help in determining its volatility as well as potential returns. Find out how it has responded to market trends, previous bull runs, global economic events etc. It may be worth noting that while past performance is not indicative of future results, it is still an important consideration.

Always stay abreast with the information about any new technologies, partnerships or upcoming launches by crypto projects. What they are planning next can drive optimism and attract more buyers during a bullish spike which may result in rocketing prices.

Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile hence evaluate the comfort with risk. How much high-risk assets would one allocate from the portfolio? Diversify by buying different cryptos so as to spread risk around.

The digital coin marketplace can be seriously impacted by regulatory news. Keep track of regulatory changes happening in major markets since favorable or unfavorable regulations may cause giant price swings.

A strong community and development team that are always busy are good signs for a crypto's viability over a long term . Active development coupled with a vibrant community contributes towards continuous improvement and adoption thus increasing the value of an asset over time on this kind of trajectory.

To pick the right cryptocurrencies for a bull run, it is necessary to take a comprehensive view on market dynamics, past performance of assets and prospects as well. In addition to being conversant with cash flows and knowledge of previous performances, one must also be updated about future changes in governance or shifts in it that may affect investor sentiment; this too is important.

To strike a balance between one's risk tolerance and what developers and other cryptocurrency participants can survive during hard times one has to identify investments that can withstand bull runs. Consequently, careful research must be done before committing any funds at such times then making advanced plans for them will lead to success.",https://150601093.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/10-1-scaled.jpg,0.5607843137254902
Ethereum's Future: A Generational Opportunity or Just Another Cycle?,https://marketbusinessnews.com/ethereums-future-generational-opportunity-or-another-cycle/398704/,2024-09-21,Market Business News,"The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with speculation about Ethereum (ETH). With its recent performance lagging behind Bitcoin (BTC) and competitors like Solana, many are wondering if this is the end for Ethereum or a temporary setback before a significant rebound.

While some analysts are cautious, others remain optimistic, pointing to historical trends and the blockchain's continued dominance in decentralized applications (dApps).

According to Steno Research, the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut could significantly benefit Ethereum by boosting onchain activity.

Coindesk.com quotes Mads Eberhardt, an analyst at Steno, who said:

""Ethereum's active addresses remain strong, particularly when factoring in the growing adoption of rollups,"" said Mads Eberhardt, an analyst at Steno.

Eberhardt added that transactional revenue appears to have bottomed out in August, a potential sign of recovery for ETH prices.

This report from Steno suggests Ethereum could regain some of its lost ground against Bitcoin. Ether has been outperformed by Bitcoin this year, with BTC surging 43% compared to Ether's modest 8% gain.

However, history shows that ETH has previously surged rapidly during altcoin seasons, doubling its value relative to Bitcoin in just a few months.

The current market might see a similar trend, as decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoin issuance, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) -- all of which primarily occur on the Ethereum blockchain -- experience growth.

According to Dailyhodl.com, cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen also sees Ethereum nearing a crucial turning point.

In a recent video shared with his 813,000 YouTube subscribers, Cowen predicted that ETH could be close to reaching a bottom against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC). Based on historical precedents from 2016 and 2019, Cowen noted that Ethereum is following a similar price structure, which suggests a bottom may be close.

""It took about seven weeks for Ethereum/Bitcoin to bottom in 2016 and about eight weeks in 2019. We're already eight weeks in, so I think we're close to a bottom,"" Cowen explained.

He further cautioned that while ETH/BTC could dip slightly lower, it's unlikely to go significantly lower from here.

Despite Ethereum's struggles, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, remains confident about its long-term prospects, according to Cointelegraph.com.

Hougan argues that Ethereum's position as the leading blockchain for dApps is unrivaled, drawing a comparison between Ethereum and Microsoft in terms of their dominance in their respective fields.

""Ethereum may be in the doldrums right now, but dismissing it would be shortsighted,"" he said, emphasizing that it remains the blockchain of choice for developers and large companies.

In fact, Ethereum still hosts 50% of all stablecoins and 60% of decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, demonstrating its continuing relevance.

Hougan also pointed to major corporations like BlackRock and Nike, which have chosen to launch blockchain-based products on Ethereum.

""When the next large traditional company wants to do a blockchain product, I bet they'll choose Ethereum too,"" he added.

However, it's not all smooth sailing for Ethereum. The much-anticipated Ethereum ETFs have not delivered the expected price surge, leaving investors disappointed.

Additionally, Ethereum's decision to shift much of its transaction volume to second-layer solutions has led to a drop in transactional revenue.

Nevertheless, Hougan maintains that Ethereum remains a strong contrarian bet through the end of 2024, particularly as the upcoming U.S. presidential election could bring regulatory clarity, potentially boosting Ethereum's value.

""It's cool to hate Ethereum right now. I bet this ends up looking silly,"" Hougan stated in a memo quoted by Tradingview.com.

Ethereum was founded in 2013 by Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin. The platform went live in July 2015, following a successful crowdsale in 2014, which helped raise funds for its development. Initially releasing with 11.9 million Ether (ETH) coins, Ethereum quickly became a cornerstone of the blockchain world.

Since its inception, Ethereum's value has skyrocketed. In 2017, its price surged over 13,000%, and today, it remains the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum continues to shape the blockchain landscape.

Ethereum stands at a pivotal moment. With its dominance in decentralized applications and strong developer activity, it remains a significant player in the blockchain ecosystem.

While short-term challenges persist, many analysts, including Cowen and Hougan, believe that Ethereum could stage a significant comeback. As Matt Hougan pointed out, writing off Ethereum now may seem ""silly"" in hindsight.

The coming months will determine whether Ethereum continues to lead the blockchain space or whether it faces stronger headwinds from its competitors.",https://marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ethereum-and-its-creator.jpg,0.3176470588235294
Cryptocurrency Development: Building and Managing Digital Currencies,https://techbullion.com/cryptocurrency-development-building-and-managing-digital-currencies-2/,2024-09-21,TechBullion,"Cryptocurrency has emerged as one of the most revolutionary innovations in the financial world. As digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and numerous altcoins gain traction, developers, and financial experts are delving deep into the technicalities of creating and managing these decentralized assets. Understanding the process of cryptocurrency development is essential for anyone looking to enter the world of blockchain technology, whether for investment, development, or regulatory purposes.

The Foundations of Cryptocurrency Development What Is Cryptocurrency?

Before diving into the development process, it's crucial to understand what cryptocurrency is. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that utilizes cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by governments and financial institutions, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology. These networks function without a central authority, relying instead on consensus mechanisms like proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS) to validate and secure transactions.

How Cryptocurrencies Are Created

Building a cryptocurrency starts with blockchain development. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Each block in the chain contains a group of transactions, and once a block is added, it cannot be altered or removed. This immutability ensures the integrity of the data and creates trust in the system.

Developers begin by choosing the type of blockchain they want to use. Many digital currencies, like Bitcoin, are built on public blockchains, which anyone can access and participate in. Others, particularly those used in enterprise settings, may be developed on private blockchains that restrict access to certain users.

Once the blockchain framework is selected, the cryptocurrency's unique protocols and algorithms are created. These protocols define the rules of the system, such as how transactions are verified, how new coins are minted, and the maximum supply of the currency. The most common consensus mechanism is proof of work, which involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. However, other mechanisms like proof of stake and delegated proof of stake (DPoS) are also gaining popularity due to their energy efficiency.

The Role of Smart Contracts in Cryptocurrency Development

Smart contracts play an integral role in the creation of many cryptocurrencies. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into the code. They automatically enforce and execute the agreed-upon conditions without needing intermediaries, making transactions faster, more secure, and transparent.

Ethereum, one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, introduced the concept of smart contracts, which has since become a standard feature in cryptocurrency development. When building a cryptocurrency, developers can integrate smart contracts to automate various processes, from token transfers to complex financial agreements.

Managing Digital Currencies: Challenges and Solutions Ensuring Security and Privacy

Security is one of the most critical aspects of managing digital currencies. Since cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, they are often targets for cyberattacks. Hacks and thefts, like the infamous Mt. Gox incident, have raised concerns about the security of digital assets.

To mitigate risks, developers implement advanced cryptographic techniques and security protocols. Multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, and two-factor authentication (2FA) are some of the common security measures used to protect digital assets. In addition, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are gaining popularity as they allow users to trade directly without relying on a central authority, reducing the risk of hacking.

Scalability Issues in Cryptocurrency Networks

One of the main challenges of managing digital currencies is scalability. As more users join the network and transaction volumes increase, the blockchain can become congested, leading to slow transaction times and high fees. Bitcoin, for instance, can handle only about seven transactions per second (TPS), which pales in comparison to traditional payment systems like Visa, which processes thousands of TPS.

To address scalability, developers are exploring solutions like layer 2 protocols (e.g., Lightning Network), sharding, and sidechains. These methods aim to increase transaction throughput without compromising the security and decentralization of the network.

Regulatory Compliance and Legal Challenges

As digital currencies gain mainstream adoption, regulatory scrutiny has intensified. Governments and financial institutions worldwide are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies and ensure they comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations. Developers must ensure that their digital currencies adhere to these regulatory standards, particularly if they are being developed for financial institutions or large-scale enterprise use.

In addition to complying with existing regulations, developers must also be prepared for new legislation as the legal landscape surrounding cryptocurrency is constantly evolving. Ensuring that the currency is legally compliant from the outset can save significant time and resources down the line.

Key Technologies in Cryptocurrency Development Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is the backbone of any cryptocurrency. It ensures transparency, security, and decentralization, which are the core principles of digital currencies. Developers need to decide whether they will use an existing blockchain, such as Ethereum, or develop their own from scratch.

Consensus Mechanisms

As mentioned earlier, consensus mechanisms are crucial for verifying transactions on the blockchain. While proof of work (PoW) remains the most common, newer cryptocurrencies are opting for proof of stake (PoS) or even hybrid mechanisms that combine multiple approaches. The choice of consensus mechanism will impact the speed, security, and scalability of the digital currency.

Cryptocurrency Wallets

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that stores private and public keys and interacts with various blockchain networks to enable users to send and receive digital currency. When managing digital currencies, it is important to offer secure and user-friendly wallet options. There are different types of wallets, including:

Software wallets:

Installed on a computer or mobile device, they allow easy access but are vulnerable to hacking if not properly secured.

Hardware wallets:

Physical devices that store keys offline, providing a higher level of security.

Paper wallets:

A printed version of public and private keys, considered one of the safest methods but less convenient for frequent transactions.

Token Standards

For developers creating new cryptocurrencies on existing blockchains, token standards like ERC-20 (Ethereum) or BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain) are essential. These standards define the rules for how tokens will operate within their respective ecosystems. Using these standards can simplify development and integration with other platforms.

The Future of Cryptocurrency Development The Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are state-issued digital currencies that aim to combine the benefits of cryptocurrencies with the stability of traditional fiat currencies. Many countries are exploring the development of CBDCs to enhance their financial systems, provide more inclusive access to banking, and streamline monetary policy implementation.

While CBDCs operate on similar principles as decentralized cryptocurrencies, they are typically more centralized, giving governments and central banks greater control over their issuance and management. Developers working in this space need to focus on creating secure, scalable, and compliant systems that can integrate with existing financial infrastructures.

Integration with DeFi (Decentralized Finance)

The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) presents another exciting frontier for cryptocurrency development. DeFi refers to a financial ecosystem that operates on blockchain technology without intermediaries like banks or brokers. Developers are building cryptocurrencies that interact seamlessly with DeFi platforms, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade assets in a decentralized manner.

By incorporating DeFi features, developers can create digital currencies with a broader range of applications, from lending protocols to decentralized exchanges and yield farming platforms.

Cross-Chain Compatibility

Another major trend in cryptocurrency development is the focus on cross-chain compatibility. As the number of blockchain networks grows, the need for interoperability between different chains becomes critical. Developers are working on solutions that allow seamless transactions and data sharing across different blockchains, facilitating greater collaboration and innovation in the crypto space.

Conclusion

Building and managing digital currencies is a complex but rewarding endeavor. From choosing the right blockchain and consensus mechanism to ensuring security and regulatory compliance, cryptocurrency development requires a deep understanding of both the technical and financial aspects of blockchain technology. As the world of digital currencies continues to evolve, developers will play a key role in shaping the future of finance by creating secure, scalable, and innovative digital assets. Whether it's developing new cryptocurrencies, improving existing ones, or integrating with emerging technologies like DeFi and CBDCs, the opportunities in cryptocurrency development are vast and ever-growing.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.

As cryptocurrency analysts and researchers are guessing when the ""real"" bull run of 2024 starts, it is crucial for investors to see it locked and loaded. During periods of extreme volatility, increased traffic and rocketing market activity, the problem of choosing a proper exchange is a paramount issue, regardless of background, skills and deposit size of a given user.

ChangeNOW, a veteran global cryptocurrency exchange, ensures a premium swapping experience for various categories of users. In this longread, we are going to review its core features and study the essential elements of its ecosystem.

Launched in 2017 by a heavy-hitting team of crypto professionals, ChangeNOW evolved into one of the most popular crypto exchange solutions on the market.

ChangeNOW is part of the broader ecosystem of Web3 products that includes RPC node service, a custody solution, a payment system and so on.

Crypto exchange is a software service designed to facilitate the exchange of various cryptocurrencies between each other. Simply put, it is a platform where internet users can buy, sell, store and transfer digital currencies, exchange them amongst each other or to fiat currencies from cards, bank accounts and so on.

A cryptocurrency exchange also works like a cryptocurrency wallet in many aspects; holders use them to receive payments in crypto, to authorize purchases in digital assets, etc.

Crypto exchanges represent an inevitable part of global cryptocurrency systems: the first platforms of this type kicked off in the early 2010s, soon after the invention of blockchain.

While modern cryptocurrency exchanges can be characterized and classified in a plethora of ways, centralized and decentralized exchanges remain the largest group of services in this class.

On centralized exchanges, the entity behind the service is responsible for private key management. A user does not have to save their private key to access the wallet on a centralized service.

By contrast, on decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, a user is the only one who is in control of their private keys from their account. If the private keys are lost, no one is able to recover access to the crypto held there.

Both categories have their own pros and cons: while centralized exchanges are more convenient and newbie-friendly, they might be exposed to hacks and manipulations. Also, they can freeze the assets of users by request of law enforcement.

Decentralized exchanges are censorship-resistant but have sophisticated UX/UI designs, low liquidity, a limited number of trading pairs and are too slow and fee-inefficient for periods of increased volatility.

While there are thousands of cryptocurrency exchanges available on the market, these simple tips can save you time choosing the most suitable one for you:

That being said, choosing a cryptocurrency exchange for the upcoming bull run takes basic expertise in crypto and time to research the interfaces, policies, reputation and toolkits of exchanges.

ChangeNOW is a one-stop crypto exchange platform designed for fast transactions and conversions between 1,000+ cryptocurrencies.

Introduced in 2017 amid the first massive cryptocurrency bull run, ChangeNOW is a cryptocurrency exchange focused on bringing the best possible swapping experience to various generations of crypto users.

ChangeNOW merges the benefits of custodial and noncustodial exchanges, offering access to over one million pairs on spot with 1,000+ cryptocurrencies: from crypto behemoths to early-stage altcoins, including memecoins, DeFi coins, LST coins, AI coins and so on.

ChangeNOW works with different blockchains from mainstream (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain) to exotic (like Manta and Base). It also features a secure and fast on- and off-ramp to fiat currencies.

ChangeNOW works with no upper exchange and withdrawal limits, while the majority of its transactions are finalized in less than two minutes. Besides a clear and newcomer-friendly web interface, it released software for iOS- and Android-based smartphones.

ChangeNOW is a part of the large Web3 NOW ecosystem that includes a node management platform, payments processor and crypto custodian for B2B clients.

Primarily, ChangeNOW is a convenient modern instrument for crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat exchanges. Over seven years of operations, it listed all major cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Cardano (ADA), XRP and so on.

However, its listing policy remains flexible: it added a number of trending L2 blockchains like Manta and Base, a couple of red-hot meme coins like DOGE, SHIB and PEPE, as well as the most popular LST and AI altcoins.

Besides that, ChangeNOW offers one of the widest toolkits for crypto-to-fiat purchasing, as it partnered with key on- and off-ramp services like Guardarian, Simplex, and Transak. In total, ChangeNOW processes payments in 60+ of the largest fiat currencies for various regions of the world.

The ChangeNOW team is proud of its super-fast exchange execution system: most operations are finalized in two minutes, with an average exchange time of five minutes. Exchange amounts start with $2 in equivalent only.

The function of a permanent address unlocks the opportunity for even more streamlined crypto exchange thanks to automated money flow and easy wallet management.

The ChangeNOW team is focused on a premium exchange experience for every client. Its responsive customer support unit accomplished a 99% user error resolution milestone.

For maximum safety and accessibility, ChangeNOW added a feature that allows transactions to be completed even if the user selects the wrong network, coin, or amount. As a result, even newcomers are protected from errors and losing funds.

ChangeNOW scored a stellar reputation on independent review platforms like TrustPilot. Its achievements are recognized by dozens of global blockchain media outlets in various languages.

Besides that, ChangeNOW pioneered an instrument for blocking suspicious transactions with its advanced anti-money laundering system.

As covered by U.Today previously, it managed to recover over $19 million in fraud transactions, and counting, all thanks to its proprietary AML scoring tool tracking every listed cryptocurrency coin.

ChangeNOW implemented a number of unique features that make the service look outstanding compared to its closest competitors. For instance, there is no need to pass mandatory registration or KYC checks.

On the platform, verification is only required once the security system detects suspicious activity or hack attempts. Also, despite keeping all the benefits of a centralized exchange (clear interface, fast operations, deep liquidity), the platform never holds users' funds, only adding a layer of security to crypto and fiat assets involved in exchanges.

In order to build transparent service economics in the long run, the exchange introduced NOW, ChangeNOW's internal utility cryptocurrency token. As a multi-chain asset, NOW exists on trending EVM-compatible networks Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Smart Chain.

The issue of NOW Token on more chains, like Polygon and TRON, is expected soon, according to the official website.

Users are able to stake NOW with an amazing 6.25% APY; thanks to the burning schedule, NOW remains a verifiably scarce asset equipped with real utility and strong tokenomic fundamentals.

Besides the benefits of NOW staking, users can optimize their profits on ChangeNOW by joining its affiliate and referral programs with generous rewards.

ChangeNOW is an integral element of the large ecosystem of Web3 products for the digital economy. Some of the products in this ecosystem include:

NOWCustody solution is designed to connect B2B clients with gateways to operations with crypto via API tooling: every e-commerce PoS platform becomes able to manage and convert cryptocurrency.

NOWPayments allows Web3 teams to accelerate the adoption of their coins by integrating them as payment tools, donation methods and so on. Also, a wide range of businesses can accept crypto as payment method thanks to NOWPayments' tools integrated.

One more product is NOWNodes that provides secure and high-performance RPC node services for dApp developers to remove the need for them to run their own full nodes.

ChangeNOW Pro is a version of the ChangeNOW platform equipped with extended functionalities, such as cashback for transactions, AML checks, unlimited cryptocurrency loans on the platform, private web pages for DeFi operations and so on.

Basic packages for ChangeNOW are free, while VIP tariffs start from as low as $15 per month.

ChangeNOW is a modern high-performance cryptocurrency exchange platform with fast transactions and transparent fees. It ensures lightning-fast exchange for 1,000+ cryptocurrencies and 60+ fiat currencies with no KYC and registration.

The exchange has its own core utility token, NOW, while other ChangeNOW ecosystem services address critical needs of modern crypto systems in the B2B and B2C segments.",https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2024-09/52026.jpg,0.003921568627450966
How to Buy Elrond (EGLD) Right Now * Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-elrond-egld,2024-09-20,Benzinga,"Elrond, now known as MultiversX, addresses the critical issue of scalability in blockchain technology by significantly enhancing transaction throughput compared to traditional networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin is limited to just 7 transactions per second and Ethereum handles around 15, the Elrond blockchain is capable of processing an impressive 260,000 transactions per second, which is a staggering five times more than Visa's capabilities. This extraordinary scalability allows Elrond to alleviate issues like backlogged transactions and high fees, providing users with a seamless and efficient experience when engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. By innovatively optimizing its architecture, Elrond not only enhances the usability of blockchain technology but also positions itself as a frontrunner in the quest for high-performance digital networks.

Ready to invest in MultiversX? Learn how to buy Elrond (EGLD) online now.

Here are the essential steps to buying EGLD:

The first step to make your purchase is to create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange that supports EGLD trading. The most well-known crypto exchanges that support MultiversX (EGLD) are Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken. No matter which trading platform you choose to make an account with, you'll need to provide personal information for tax purposes. This may include your full name, address, phone number, birthday and Social Security number.

Once your account is verified, you can start making a deposit. Most trading platforms provide several payment options. These include bank transfers, credit cards, debit cards, and crypto deposits from other exchanges or wallets. Follow the platform's instructions for your chosen payment method. Enter the amount you wish to deposit and review any applicable transaction fees.

Once your account is funded, it's time to make your purchase. Depending on the cryptocurrency exchange you use, you can buy EGLD with either USD or bitcoin. Some traders prefer to purchase altcoins with bitcoin so they can track how their investments compare to Bitcoin's value.

Navigate to the trade section of your chosen platform and search for your preferred trading pair. Place a buy order based on the amount you wish to purchase. Review the details before you execute the order.

Elrond is a smart contract enabled blockchain network. Smart contracts are code that is uploaded to the blockchain. What makes smart contracts unique is their ability to hold cryptocurrency in escrow, enabling automated financial functions such as loans, exchange, and insurance. Ethereum is the most prominent example of a blockchain that supports smart contracts, but it faces scalability issues, processing only about 30 transactions per second and incurring high transaction costs, making it impractical for small-scale use.

Elrond solves the problem of scalability through a process called sharding. Sharding makes it possible to compute multiple transactions at once through splitting the blockchain into shards. This way, computer nodes only have to process a portion of the blockchain's data, making it possible for different computers to process separate transactions synchronously.

Elrond can support smart contracts just like Ethereum, but Elrond has much faster and cheaper transactions. Transactions on Elrond typically cost less than a cent.

eGold (EGLD) is the native cryptocurrency used on Elrond's platform. When the platform launched, the cryptocurrency was an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum.

Recently, the platform has started migrating these ERC-20 tokens to eGold at a conversion rate of 1000:1. In only a few months after December 2020, eGold rose from $9 to $138, an over a 1,500% return in just three months. Even in the volatile cryptocurrency market this is impressive.

eGold is meant to be a store of value on Elrond's network, but it has several features of a utility token as well. eGold is needed to pay for transactions as well as governance on the network.

Since the network is decentralized, eGold is used like a ""voting share"" in the network to vote on upgrade proposals to the network. And eGold can be staked on Elrond to power its network, and you can earn a high annual interest on your eGold through staking.

Elrond was established by three co-founders: Beniamin Mincu, Lucian Mincu and Lucian Todea. These founders have an extensive background in blockchain and cryptocurrency. The Mincu brothers founded Metachain Capital, a cryptocurrency investment fund. Todea has a background in technology and has successfully started several startups in the past.

The platform was conceived in 2017, and its initial exchange offering (IEO) launched in 2017. IEOs are similar to initial coin offerings (ICOs), but the launch operates directly on exchanges. In 2022, Elrond rebranded as MultiversX, shifting from a blockchain platform to an expansive ecosystem for metaverse interactions and digital assets. This rebranding faced challenges like competition and market volatility, as MultiversX aims to adapt to the growing demand for immersive digital experiences while navigating technological and regulatory challenges to become a leader in the metaverse space.

Elrond token was initially put up for sale at $0.00065 (which would be equal to $0.65 of eGold). Since then, the token's price has appreciated about 210 times its initial value.

Take a look at our top picks for crypto platforms to purchase EGLD online.

Now that you know how to buy EGLD, you need to know exactly how to store your cryptocurrencies safely. Here are the best software and hardware wallets to hold Elrond.

Not very many hardware wallets are available to store your eGold on, but thanks to Ledger Live you can store your Elrond on a Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X. Ledger live is like an app store for cryptocurrency wallets -- you're able to download different types of crypto wallets onto your Ledger wallet to store a variety of altcoins.

Elrond Wallet is made by Elrond for its users to securely store their eGold tokens. Since eGold is not an ERC-20 token, you can't store your funds in an Ethereum wallet. Elrond has many great features investors in eGold can take advantage of, such as token staking for interest rates.

You can't directly trade cryptocurrency from your wallet, so if you plan on actively trading your eGold you'll need to store your cryptocurrency on an exchange. An exchange's security should be very important to you if you plan to trade eGold.

The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $2.19 trillion. To get an idea of how the market is moving, check out current cryptocurrency prices of ma below.

On paper, Elrond is a much better solution for a smart contract enabled blockchain than Ethereum. It's cheaper to use and magnitudes more scalable. However, Ethereum has network effect advantages, as most smart contract applications are built on Ethereum, not Elrond. If Elrond can attract developers to its platform before the Ethereum foundation solves Ethereum's scalability problems, then it may be a great investment.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/04105031/elrond.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.3176470588235294

KR1 plc

(""KR1"" or the ""Company"")

Interim Report for the Half Year Ended 30 June 2024

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, today announces its half year results for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (""HY24"").

Financial Highlights

Net assets of £145.2 million, +60.1% on HY23; -25.5% on FY23NAV per share of 82.01p as at 30 June 2024, +60.4% on HY23; -25.4% on FY23Income from digital assets of £8.7 million, +123% on HY23

Investment Highlights

""Greatly boosted by the Company's successful investment in Celestia, the half-year started strongly for the Company's portfolio, even surpassing previous end-of-year highs. However, following Bitcoin's surge up to all-time highs, there has been a lengthy period of consolidation, which is challenging for most of the crypto market and the Company's portfolio.""

Market Outlook

""Looking ahead, key catalysts that will dictate where crypto assets are heading will be the future outlook on interest rates across the globe as well as the US election outcome, resulting in a potentially more favourable regime for crypto in the US.""

Managing Directors' Report

Since Bitcoins' all-time high this Spring, the crypto markets have entered a period of consolidation, once again offering both seasoned and new investors valuable lessons in resilience and long-term thinking. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, it provides an opportunity for market participants to strategise for the next growth phase.

As detailed in our most recent annual report, we continue to work hard with relevant policymakers, strategic partners, and the newly elected government, to support the United Kingdom in realising its ambition to become a global crypto-asset hub and remain competitive in the field. We firmly believe that the UK has the potential to be a leader where digital asset firms have the clarity needed to invest and innovate, while customers receive the necessary protection.

We recently witnessed the most comprehensive overhaul of rules for London-listed companies in over thirty years and the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange Traded Notes for trading on the London Stock Exchange earlier this year. Those reforms present an opportune moment for the new government and the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") to further embrace the potential of blockchain and digital assets, as the world rapidly shifts towards a new digital economy. Despite giant steps in the right direction, these developments merit further review to hopefully loosen the 'blanket ban' on crypto and digital asset firms being admitted to the FCA's official list, which has been in place since the FCA's Cryptoasset Taskforce report was published in October 2018.

In the UK and globally, we have seen the incredible impact of the internet on our daily lives, the economy and society. Tokenisation, blockchain-enabled technologies, and digital assets represent the next frontier of technological innovation, offering greater security, financial inclusion, diversity and competitiveness in consumer services. By streamlining regulations to foster an innovation-friendly environment, the UK can boost its global competitiveness and revitalise its stagnant capital markets by attracting global investment into homegrown talent, enabling significant growth opportunities for the country and the resulting trickle-down effect on its entire economy.

Outside of the UK, crypto and digital assets have become key topics in US politics, particularly among Republicans and their presidential candidate. Even Democrats, who have previously shown hostility towards digital assets, are seemingly changing their stance towards the industry. The shifting political landscape in Washington indicates a growing acceptance and strategic interest in digital assets, highlighting a pivotal moment for the industry, both in the US and globally.

Greatly boosted by the Company's successful investment in Celestia, the half-year started strongly for the Company's portfolio, surpassing previous end-of-year highs. However, following Bitcoin's surge up to all-time highs, there has then been a lengthy period of consolidation, which has affected the crypto market and the Company's portfolio. Fundamentally, the crypto ecosystem keeps pushing forward, with more developers joining and many important growth metrics continuing to improve. Ethereum's roll-up-centric roadmap is playing out, greatly benefiting Celestia's positioning. Celestia itself recently unveiled its updated roadmap, removing additional friction points for developers as well as a massive increase in data throughput. Polkadot, another major investment of the Company, is also continuing to take further steps towards executing on its recently updated technical roadmap with Polkadot 'Plaza', an improved version of Polkadot's 'Asset Hub', and further progress on the 'JAM' protocol, which was unveiled earlier this year by Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot's founder.

We have continued to allocate capital to great teams and projects, having made several investments to complement our portfolio so far this year. We invested in Avail, which is positioning itself as a unifying force for a rollup-centric blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, we supported Mode, which aims to bring decentralised finance on Ethereum to millions of users, through seed and follow-on funding. We also participated in the strategic funding round for Tanssi, a promising project within Polkadot that recently expanded into Ethereum's rollup and restaking ecosystem. These investments reflect our commitment to backing innovative technologies with strong growth potential and our confidence in the teams' abilities to drive the future of decentralised technologies. Further portfolio projects that are yet to be launched are Anoma, pioneering a new generation of blockchains optimised for seamless user experiences, and Redstone, which is seeing great adoption through partnerships and use cases across the entire crypto ecosystem.

The Company's staking activities continued to deliver consistent income, amounting to £8.7 million for the first half of 2024. Through staking, the Company is contributing to the security of decentralised networks and, in return, is earning staking rewards, thereby compounding its holdings. This steady income stream highlights the strength and reliability of our staking strategy, significantly contributing to the Company's overall financial performance and showcasing our ability to generate value for our shareholders.

Looking ahead, key catalysts that will dictate where crypto assets are heading will be the future outlook on interest rates across the globe as well as the US election outcome, resulting in a potentially more favourable regime for crypto in the US.

As we continue into 2024 and beyond, we want to thank our investors for their continued support as we keep building out a high-quality, 'long-only' portfolio of innovative digital assets. As in previous years, KR1 plc remains at the very heart of the thriving crypto ecosystem, fully focused on taking advantage of the disruption that this exciting technology will bring to society.

Interim Report Notes

Interim report

The information relates to the 6-month period from 1 January to 30 June 2024 ""HY 2024"" and is unaudited with comparatives for the 6-month period from 1 January to 30 June 2023 ""HY 2023"" (unaudited) and for the year ended 31 December 2023 ""FY 2023"" (audited).

The interim report was approved by the Directors on 18 September 2024.

The full interim report will be made available on the Company website kr1.io/documents

Basis of accounting

While the financial information included in this interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRSs""), this interim financial information does not itself contain sufficient information to comply fully with IFRSs.These interim financial statements are the financial statements of the Company.The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the modification to a fair value listed financial assets and intangible assets traded in an active market which are carried at fair value as specified in the accounting policies below and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards.Assets

Digital assets and Cryptocurrency assets

The Company holds digital assets and cryptocurrency assets which do not qualify for recognition as cash and cash equivalents or financial assets. The Company does not meet the definition of a broker-trader under IAS 2 ""Inventories"" as the assets are not principally acquired for the purpose of selling in the near future and brokerage in nature. The assets are held with a view to medium to long term capital growth.

Considering this, the digital assets and cryptocurrency assets have been classified as Intangible Assets in accordance with IAS 38. and the revaluation model has been applied as there is an active market for the cryptocurrencies. The assets are identifiable, separable and future economic benefits are expected. Intangible assets held are measured initially at cost and are subsequently carried at a revalued amount based on fair value.

All assets in this class are accounted for using the same model unless there is no active market for those assets. A class of intangible assets is a grouping of assets of a similar nature and use in an entity's operations. The items within a class of intangible assets are revalued simultaneously to avoid selective revaluation of assets and the reporting of amounts in the Financial Statements representing a mixture of costs and values as at different dates.

Revaluation increases in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation surplus within equity. Revaluation decreases which offset previous increases are charged in other comprehensive income and debited to the revaluation surplus directly in equity. All other decreases are charged to the income statement.

The digital assets and cryptocurrency assets have indefinite useful lives and are reviewed at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for that asset.

Digital assets and cryptocurrency assets may be temporarily locked due to participation in activities including, but not limited to staking.

Digital assets and cryptocurrency assets delivered to the Company from early-stage investments for future tokens may be subject to restrictions such as lockups and vesting schedules.

The Company recognises digital assets and cryptocurrency assets as 'locked' when these assets are held in Company owned accounts or blockchain wallets under the Company's control whereby the unlock of these digital assets and cryptocurrency assets is in accordance with certain conditions, including but not limited to, a schedule dependent on time or blockchain block count, which is dictated by computer code, such as a smart contract deployed on a particular blockchain or similar mechanisms. Locked digital assets and cryptocurrency assets may be unlocked in a full tranche or partially over time.

Digital assets and cryptocurrency assets that are legally owned by the Company from early-stage investments for future tokens may be distributed to Company owned accounts or blockchain wallets under the Company's control by the investee team over time in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements between the Company and the investees. The Company recognises these owned but yet-to-be-received digital assets and cryptocurrency assets as Intangible assets receivable.

Whilst, under such circumstances the Company generally forfeits its ability to sell or otherwise transfer its locked digital assets and cryptocurrency assets, no other entity obtains the right to direct their use and the Company is still the primary entity holding the risks and rewards of ownership. Locked digital assets and cryptocurrency assets may be unlocked as a full tranche or may be subject to unlock and vesting schedules.

The Company does not derecognise time locked or vesting digital assets and cryptocurrency assets which are classified and measured in the same manner as non-locked digital assets and cryptocurrency assets.

The Company classifies digital assets and cryptocurrency assets which are due for release no later than one year after the period end as intangible assets held as current assets. Digital assets and cryptocurrency assets, which are due for release more than one year after the period end are classified as intangible assets held as non-current assets.

Digital assets and cryptocurrency assets receivable from third parties subject to unlock and vesting schedules, or as distributions and rewards are classified as intangible assets receivable.

Early-stage investments for future tokens

Unlike the digital asset and cryptocurrencies held, there is no active market for these agreements and hence these are held under the cost model and subsequent to initial recognition will be held at cost less impairment. No amortisation will be charged to the assets as the investment is entered into with the outcome expected that digital assets and cryptocurrency assets will be provided at the end of the agreement following a projects' launch.

Revaluation decreases are charged to the income statement.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Company manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Company's documented risk management or investment strategy. Upon initial recognition attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss.

i. Financial assets are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Foreign denomination loans are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. For those financial assets listed on a recognised market, net realisable value is taken as mid-market price. Where the directors consider the market price of a current asset is likely to irreversibly fall, additional write downs in valuation to below mid-market price are made.

ii. The net realisable value of certain financial assets is not readily determinable by reference to a quoted market price. The directors have therefore made their own assessment of the net realisable value and adjusted the carrying value of the current asset where it is considered less than cost. This estimate requires estimation techniques, which are reliant upon their experience and expertise.

Receivables

Receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

Digital assets and cryptocurrency assets which are legally owned by the Company from early-stage investments for future tokens may be distributed to Company owned accounts or blockchain wallets under the Company's control by the investee team over time in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements between the Company and the investees. The Company recognises these owned but yet-to-be-received digital assets and cryptocurrency assets as Intangible assets receivable.

The Company will report again for the full year to 31 December 2024.

The Directors of KR1 plc accept responsibility for this announcement.

Better Buy: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-bitcoin-vs-ethereum-110700844.html,2024-09-19,Yahoo! Finance,"Cryptocurrency investors can't just invest in crypto. There's no equivalent to the stock market's S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index yet, where you could buy an exchange-traded fund that represents the broad performance of the market. Instead, investors must pick crypto names by hand.

The largest and most popular choices are Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). But which one of these industry-defining pioneers is the better buy right now?

Motley Fool contributors Dominic Basulto and Anders Bylund respectfully disagree on the answer to that question. Read on to see where you stand in this clash of classic cryptocurrency colossi.

Dominic Basulto (Ethereum): For almost its entire existence, Ethereum has played second fiddle to Bitcoin. In the minds of many investors, Bitcoin is ""digital gold,"" and there's no way that Ethereum can ever compete with that.

But there's one major advantage that Ethereum has over Bitcoin. Although the latter is by and large just a digital asset that you buy and hold for the long haul, the former is both a digital asset and a blockchain ecosystem.

That's not to say that developers aren't building on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, but all the real action is happening on smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum.

When it comes to any new blockchain innovation, Ethereum is typically the first to market. For example, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain gaming, decentralized applications, and decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum was the early pioneer. Yes, there have been a few duds along the way (does anyone still remember the first metaverse worlds built on top of Ethereum?), but by and large, new innovations occurring within this blockchain ecosystem have sent the price of Ethereum higher.

When you take into account Ethereum's future growth potential, you have to take into account how fast each of these vastly different areas of the blockchain world is growing.

Consider DeFi, for example. Ethereum's unique smart contract platform has resulted in tremendous value already being created.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest thinks the real value-creation process is just getting started. She estimates that smart contract platforms, led by Ethereum, will create more than $5 trillion in market value during the next five years as they fundamentally reshape the face of modern finance. If you're keeping score at home, that's nearly five times the current market cap of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin might be the future of money, but Ethereum is the future of finance. While Bitcoin might be ""digital gold,"" Ethereum is the ""digital oil"" that powers the blockchain world. Both are fantastic long-term investments, but there's a case to be made for Ethereum eventually surpassing Bitcoin in value to become the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.

Anders Bylund (Bitcoin): Don't get me wrong -- there's certainly a place for Ethereum in any serious crypto investor's portfolio. But the smart contracts pioneer is surrounded by hungry rivals, some of which come with clear technical advantages.

Meanwhile, I don't see a serious alternative to Bitcoin's value-storing (and building) function. A handful of challengers have come along, but none had any real staying power.

Given the network effect of Bitcoin's $1 trillion market value, it will be difficult for newcomers to steal market share from this proven platform. That's true even if someone comes up with a superior technical solution at this point.

It's too late to dethrone the king of digital currencies. Bitcoin is almost guaranteed to deliver tremendous investor returns in the years and decades ahead. Million-dollar price targets are common, and for good reason. Bitcoin is an inflation-proof digital currency that may disrupt financial markets over time, and these are the early days of that long-term revolution.

I'm not saying that all your cash should be converted into Bitcoin, of course. I won't go any further than ""almost guaranteed"" on its long-term return prospects. The digital currency may be safe from rival value-storage solutions such as Kaspa and Bitcoin Cash, but it faces other risks.

For instance, the blockchain has been safe and secure so far, but future technologies -- like a mature quantum computing system -- might break that security. Governments and regulators around the world have the power to help or hurt Bitcoin in the long run.

And what happens if Bitcoin prices don't rise in line with the halving-cycle history? The transaction-approval system could break down in that scenario. I'm just scratching the surface of a long list of real Bitcoin risks.

That's why I can't match the Bitcoin bullishness of maximalists like MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. Under his lead, MicroStrategy is buying Bitcoin with cash reserves, borrowed money, incoming cash flow from the company's software business, and the occasional stock sale.

It's a great idea, as long as Bitcoin doesn't run into any of the potentially game-changing challenges I mentioned or new ones I haven't thought of yet. But Saylor's company could lose it all if something goes wrong. That's a risky example I don't want to follow.

There has to be some room for error here, and Bitcoin should represent a modest portion of your overall investment portfolio. But if I had to choose just one cryptocurrency to buy today and hold for the long haul, Bitcoin would be it. This cryptocurrency should be a healthy part of every balanced investment portfolio, especially in low-priced periods like today when the crypto is setting up for the next halving-based price jump.

Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $708,348!*

"Ethereum price today: ETH is down 0.36% today, trading at $2,299.44",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-19-2024/,2024-09-19,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, was $2,299.44 as of 8 a.m. ET. The crypto's highest intraday price in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Ethereum launched in 2015 and is the most popular altcoin. Along with bitcoin, it has become one of the most recognizable forms of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum reached a 52-week intraday high of $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024, and a 52-week intraday low of $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has a global market capitalization of $293.24 billion. Year over year, ETH has increased 41%.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $293.24 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $301 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 71% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based platform. It facilitates secure financial transactions. The network's native token is ether.

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,299.44.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 131% and ETH is up 41% year over year.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.09019607843137245

Riswap.com: The Fastest and Most Reliable Platform for Crypto Swaps · Cardano Feed,https://cardanofeed.com/riswap-com-the-fastest-and-most-reliable-platform-for-crypto-swaps-621,2024-09-19,cardanofeed.com,"🚀 Stay Ahead with AltcoinDaily.co! 🌐 In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, efficiency, security, and ease of use are essential factors that traders and investors look for in an exchange platform....

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, efficiency, security, and ease of use are essential factors that traders and investors look for in an exchange platform. Riswap has emerged as one of the most user-friendly and fastest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering seamless swaps for over 164 digital assets, including popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA).

Designed with both casual and experienced traders in mind, Riswap has quickly become a go-to platform for those seeking instant, high-limit swaps, secure transactions, and robust customer support. This article delves into why Riswap is gaining rapid popularity and how it stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency exchange market.

Riswap is an instant cryptocurrency exchange that provides users with a platform to swap digital currencies quickly and efficiently. The exchange offers Web3 connectivity, allowing users to connect their wallets securely while executing trades without the need for an intermediary.

Unlike traditional exchanges that require users to deposit funds before trading, Riswap enables instant swaps, meaning users can exchange their cryptocurrencies directly without any delays, making the process more efficient. This convenience, combined with the ability to trade 164+ cryptocurrencies, positions Riswap as an attractive option for anyone looking to manage their crypto assets easily.

One of Riswap's standout features is its impressive speed. While many exchanges can take hours, or even days, to process transactions, Riswap completes swaps in as little as 2-10 minutes. This makes it one of the fastest platforms for crypto trading, offering traders a reliable way to execute quick transactions, even during high-traffic times.

This fast turnaround time is crucial for traders who need to react quickly to market changes. In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, every second can count. Riswap's ability to facilitate rapid swaps ensures users can seize market opportunities without delay.

When trading cryptocurrencies, finding the best exchange rates can make a significant difference, especially when trading in large volumes. Riswap offers some of the most competitive exchange rates on the market for popular digital currencies, including BTC, ETH, XRP, and ADA.

This rate advantage is a major draw for seasoned traders who need to maximize their returns on trades. By offering top-tier rates, Riswap positions itself as not just a fast exchange but also an economical one, helping users save money on their swaps.

Another feature that sets Riswap apart is its high exchange limits. Many platforms cap the amount users can trade at a time, especially when it comes to large transactions. This limitation can be frustrating for users who need to move significant amounts of cryptocurrency quickly.

Riswap solves this problem by offering extremely high swap limits, making it an ideal platform for high-volume traders and institutional investors. In fact, it's hard to hit the maximum trading limits on Riswap, ensuring that users with significant assets can trade without restrictions.

Security is a critical consideration when choosing a cryptocurrency exchange, and Riswap takes security seriously. The platform integrates Web3 connectivity, which allows users to interact with the exchange directly through their wallets, reducing the risk associated with storing assets on a centralized platform.

In addition to its secure connection, Riswap does not require users to sign up for an account to trade, offering a level of privacy that is increasingly rare in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. This privacy-first approach appeals to users who want to maintain control over their personal information while still taking advantage of instant trades.

Riswap also regularly audits its security protocols to ensure the safety of user assets, adding an additional layer of protection for traders.

In the world of cryptocurrency, markets are open 24/7, and issues can arise at any time. Riswap provides around-the-clock customer support, ensuring that users can get help whenever they need it.

Whether you are encountering technical issues, need clarification on a transaction, or require assistance with navigating the platform, Riswap's team of experts is available via multiple support channels. This level of service ensures that users, regardless of their time zone or experience level, can get real-time assistance and resolve any issues without delays.

How This AI Play-to-Date Token Has Arisen As the Markets Most Favorable Cryptocurrency Since Bitcoin and Ethereum,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/how-this-ai-play-to-date-token-has-arisen-as-the-markets-most-favorable-cryptocurrency-since-bitcoin-and-ethereum/,2024-09-18,NewsBTC,"The cryptocurrency market has long been dominated by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two titans of the digital asset world. Bitcoin (BTC), as the pioneer, has served as a store of value, while Ethereum (ETH) has redefined blockchain utility with its smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). However, a new challenger has emerged in 2024 -- GoodEgg (GEGG). This AI-driven Play-to-Date token has quickly gained momentum, positioning itself as the market's most favorable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

For years, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the gold standard in the crypto market. Despite its volatile nature, Bitcoin (BTC) has maintained its dominance due to its limited supply and recognition as a decentralized store of value. However, recent market developments have shown that even Bitcoin (BTC) is not immune to the uncertainties of the global economy.

As of September 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) struggles to stay above the $60K mark. The Federal Reserve's impending decision to lower interest rates has created uncertainty around Bitcoin (BTC), leading many investors to reconsider their positions. Moreover, concerns about upcoming U.S. elections and global economic conditions have contributed to Bitcoin's (BTC) price fluctuations, making it less appealing for risk-averse investors.

In contrast to Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility, Ethereum (ETH) has offered more stability and consistent growth. Ethereum (ETH) continues to attract developers and investors due to its unmatched capabilities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). The recent upgrades to Ethereum 2.0, which aim to improve scalability and energy efficiency, have further strengthened Ethereum's (ETH) position as the go-to platform for innovation in the blockchain space.

Ethereum's (ETH) price has held steady around the $2,300 mark, even as Bitcoin (BTC) has faced declines. Many investors view Ethereum (ETH) as a more secure long-term investment due to its utility and growing ecosystem. The ongoing development of Ethereum's (ETH) Layer 2 solutions, such as rollups, has increased its scalability and transaction throughput, attracting more users and projects to the network.

While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain strong pillars of the cryptocurrency world, GoodEgg (GEGG) has rapidly become the market's new favorite. As an AI-driven Play-to-Date token, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers something unique in the crypto space -- a blend of entertainment, social engagement, and financial rewards. GoodEgg (GEGG)'s 'Social Scoring' system allows users to earn tokens through virtual dating experiences, adding a layer of interactivity that both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) lack.

GoodEgg (GEGG) has gained significant attention during its presale phase, with its price recently reaching $0.00021. Investors are drawn to its innovative approach, which integrates AI technology with blockchain, creating a unique ecosystem where users can both socialize and earn. This hybrid utility model has made GoodEgg (GEGG) stand out in a market crowded with speculative tokens.

Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), which primarily functions as a store of value, or Ethereum (ETH), which is centered around DeFi and dApps, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a more engaging and interactive experience. Its Play-to-Date model taps into the growing trend of gamification in the crypto space, allowing users to actively participate in earning rewards while enjoying social interactions.

Moreover, the utility of GoodEgg (GEGG) goes beyond mere speculation. As more people recognize the value of combining social engagement with financial incentives, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioned to become a key player in the Social-Fi space. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have solidified their places in the crypto world, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a fresh alternative that appeals to younger, tech-savvy investors.

As Bitcoin (BTC) faces increased volatility and Ethereum (ETH) continues to develop its ecosystem, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly carving out its own niche. Analysts predict that GoodEgg (GEGG) could see substantial price appreciation in the coming months, particularly as it prepares for Tier-1 exchange listings. Its innovative use of AI, combined with its strong community engagement, makes it one of the most promising tokens on the market today.

In conclusion, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain dominant forces in the cryptocurrency world, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a formidable competitor. With its unique Play-to-Date model, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a refreshing approach to blockchain and social interaction, making it one of the most favorable cryptocurrencies since the rise of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

Ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,307.70 as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price the cryptocurrency reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Ethereum launched in 2015 and is the most popular altcoin. Along with bitcoin, it has become one of the most recognizable forms of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $276.83 billion. It's up 40% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $276.83 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 71% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $75.67 billion, XRP at $57.32 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.65 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $276.83 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $300 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based platform. It facilitates secure financial transactions. The network's native token is ether.

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,307.70.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 40% year over year, compared to a 120% gain for bitcoin.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to safely store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.0980392156862746

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $277.83 billion. It's up 39% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $277.83 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $308 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $294 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 70% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,307.67.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 117% year over year, compared to a 39% gain for ethereum.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The Ethereum Bulls Come Out To Support New ETH Gambling ICO Mpeppe Currently at $0.0021 | Altcoin | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/760c2-the-ethereum-bulls-come-out-to-support-new-eth-gambling-ico-mpeppe-currently-at-0-0021,2024-09-17,CryptoRank,"The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic space, where new projects with high potential emerge constantly. As seasoned investors seek fresh opportunities, it appears that the latest buzz is surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new decentralized gambling token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. With a current price of $0.0021, this ICO has piqued the interest of Ethereum bulls who are backing Mpeppe for its promising future.

Despite its historic dominance in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has recently faced significant challenges. As of September 16, 2024, Ethereum (ETH) saw a price dip of nearly 6% in 24 hours, dropping to $2,272. This decline mirrors the broader market's bearish movement, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). ETH investors have been closely monitoring the situation as Ethereum (ETH)'s price slid from a high of $2,424.43 to a low of $2,253.71 in a single day.

Much of this movement has been attributed to a range of factors, including $12.92 million outflows from Ethereum-focused ETFs and general market jitters ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy meeting (FOMC). Nevertheless, Ethereum (ETH)'s bulls remain hopeful for a recovery, with some optimistic projections suggesting that ETH could surge to $10,000 by the end of 2024. In the meantime, savvy Ethereum (ETH) holders are turning their attention to other high-potential assets like Mpeppe (MPEPE), eager to capitalize on the upside while Ethereum (ETH) navigates turbulent waters.

Mpeppe (MPEPE) has rapidly gained attention as a promising new ICO in the decentralized gambling sector. Built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to revolutionize the online gambling industry by offering provably fair gaming and leveraging smart contracts for transparency. The token's unique proposition has attracted Ethereum (ETH) investors, who are always on the lookout for projects with solid growth potential.

At a current price of $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents an early-stage opportunity for investors. As the ICO progresses, many Ethereum (ETH) holders have doubled their Mpeppe (MPEPE) holdings, confident that this project will experience exponential growth in the coming months. With Ethereum (ETH) bulls backing Mpeppe (MPEPE), the token is poised for a major breakout, particularly as it draws from Ethereum (ETH)'s robust network and liquidity.

Ethereum (ETH) holders are known for being early adopters of promising blockchain projects. Their involvement in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and now decentralized gambling has helped foster the growth of numerous successful ventures. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is no exception. As Ethereum struggles to regain its momentum in the short term, ETH holders are diversifying their portfolios by backing Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its high-growth potential.

The decentralized gambling market is estimated to grow significantly in the next few years, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a key player in this sector. With Ethereum (ETH)'s smart contract capabilities and the trust that the ETH blockchain provides, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers investors the chance to participate in an emerging market that could rival traditional online casinos. By doubling their Mpeppe (MPEPE) holdings, Ethereum (ETH) investors are positioning themselves for potential gains while the broader cryptocurrency market continues to evolve.

Despite Ethereum's current struggles, many investors remain confident in the long-term potential of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum's robust ecosystem, including decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects, and its transition to Ethereum 2.0, has cemented its role as a foundational layer for blockchain innovation. As of now, Ethereum's market cap stands at $273.94 billion, and though its price has dipped below $2,300, the long-term outlook for ETH remains optimistic.

Some analysts are projecting that Ethereum could break through the $10,000 mark by the end of 2024, contingent on Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new highs and the overall crypto market seeing renewed bullish sentiment. Factors such as Ethereum-focused ETFs, increased institutional adoption, and continued growth in the DeFi space could all serve as catalysts for this price increase.

However, in the short term, Ethereum's price is likely to remain volatile. Many ETH whales have been moving their holdings to exchanges like Coinbase, reflecting a bearish sentiment in the market. Yet, even amid these challenges, Ethereum's resilience as a leading blockchain network gives it a strong foundation for recovery.

For Ethereum holders, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a balanced strategy. By maintaining core holdings in Ethereum, which is a more established asset, while allocating capital to a high-potential ICO like Mpeppe, investors can mitigate risk while positioning themselves for substantial gains. Mpeppe's innovative approach to decentralized gambling, combined with its Ethereum-based infrastructure, offers a unique value proposition that traditional gambling platforms cannot match.

As the ICO continues and Mpeppe's price moves closer to its projected target of $0.00235, Ethereum investors who have already backed the token are likely to see significant returns. The combination of Ethereum's stability and Mpeppe's growth potential makes this a winning strategy for those looking to navigate the current market turbulence.

Ethereum (ETH) may be facing short-term challenges, but its community of investors continues to seek out innovative projects that offer higher returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its current price of $0.0021, is one such project that has garnered the support of Ethereum bulls. As the decentralized gambling sector grows and Mpeppe gains traction, ETH holders are doubling down on this promising ICO. With Ethereum's long-term prospects still strong and Mpeppe's growth potential clear, the combination of these two assets could yield impressive returns for investors in the months to come.

Ian:

Hey everyone. Welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today I'm joined by David Tse, who is a co-founder of BabylonChain and also a professor at Stanford University. David, welcome to the program.

David:

Hey, Ian. Very nice meeting you, and thanks for having me here.

Ian:

David, it is my pleasure to have someone with your story career in research. We'll come to that in a moment, but maybe we can start with BabylonChain. I was introduced by a former colleague, sent me the white paper a few weeks back, and I have to say this idea of being able to use Bitcoin to power proof-of-stake networks was a little bit mind-bending at first. Can we talk about maybe a quick overview of the concept? We'll dive into the details as we go into the show, but a quick overview of the concept and where the idea came from that led you to build Babylon.

David:

Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain in the whole Web3 ecosystem. So the idea of sharing the security of Bitcoin with other blockchains is actually not a new idea. In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, came up with this idea called merged mining in 2010-2011 timeframe when he was still around. The merged mining idea was to share security between Bitcoin and another proof-of-work chain. So as everyone knows, Bitcoin is a proof-of-work chain. And so Satoshi Nakamoto had this idea of sharing the work that is done by the miners with another proof-of-work chain as a means of sharing security.

What we came up with is this idea that, hey, new blockchains that are coming up in the past five years, they're almost all proof-of-stake. So therefore, this mining concept is not very useful for those proof-of-stake chains. You need security from Bitcoin. And then we came to the observation that although Bitcoin is a proof-of-work chain, that proof-of-work is securing an asset, which is worth today about $1.2, $1.3 trillion. So that asset itself could be a staking asset to secure all these proof-of-stake. That was sort of a re-come moment. Instead of thinking along the lines of Satoshi Nakamoto focusing on the work, we focus on the fruit of the work, which is the Bitcoin asset itself, and use that to secure the proof-of-stake chain.

Now, this concept is actually quite loaded because most proof-of-stake chains, the current ones, are actually secured by their own asset. And what we're saying here is a broader point, which is actually you don't need necessarily your own asset or only your own asset to secure your chain. You can bring in a much bigger asset and that asset can provide collateral to ensure good behavior and to secure your chain. And so what we're saying is that that big asset, a natural one, will be Bitcoin. And so a protocol at a high level enables any Bitcoin holders to stake that Bitcoin and to use it to secure a proof-of-stake chain choice when our protocol is fully built out.

Ian:

I've got so many questions about how this works in practice, which we'll dive into. But I was going through some of your publications research that you've published on Google Scholar, and I noticed that there's quite a bit of research being done into the mechanisms of compromise or potential weak points in the Ethereum chain architecture and other networks as well. I'm curious what led you to that particular vein of research. And does that relate to eventual development of BabylonChain? A better way to secure some of these networks seems connected in my mind.

David:

So maybe a broader context of my background is that I entered the crypto space five years ago. I'm primarily a researcher. In my past life, I've been doing a lot of research on wireless infrastructure. So I started doing that almost decades ago. So a lot of the technology that you use in your cell phone, actually, some of them are due to my invention. But five years ago, I decided that this new blockchain area is really a super cool research area. So I started a research group at Stanford to do research in this area. Now, actually, our beginning research point was how to scale up Bitcoin, how to design a better protocol to scale Bitcoin. That was our first paper in the area, actually. Now, after we wrote that paper, we thought, ""We hit it big. Guys, we solved the problem, we scaled Bitcoin. What else is there to solve?"" And then we made a point that the rest of the world went a different direction. The rest of the world went to the proof-of-stake direction.

And we were obsessed about Bitcoin because that's how we entered the space.

Ian:

I am curious if you recall, what were the recommendations to scale Bitcoin in that first research paper that you produced?

David:

So Bitcoin is very slow because every block is produced once every 10 minutes. And so you think of blockchain as a voting mechanism as though you're saying, ""We're gating and we only allow one voter to come into the voting booth every 10 minutes."" Imagine now in a country like United States, how long would that take to elect the president? One voter every 10 minutes. And that's why Bitcoin is so slow. You only have one voter every 10 minutes.

So [inaudible 00:05:32] a way to parallelize Bitcoin to many parallel chains so that many people can simultaneously vote on a Bitcoin block so that you can finalize, you can confirm it very fast. So that was the main innovation.

Ian:

And so back to the story, so that wasn't picked up. The world said, ""Hey, instead of taking that approach, we're heading off down the proof-of-stake."" And so what did that mean for your next research effort?

David:

So I told my students, I said, ""We should probably do some research on proof-of-stake because nobody cares about proof-of-work on anymore."" All right. So the first paper, one of the early papers we looked at, was a paper by Vitalik. So at that time, it was around 2020. COVID was hitting us. And we had nothing to do, we were sitting around. But then Vitalik published a paper on a protocol called Gasper, and that was the protocol for Ethereum proof-of-stake. So that was still one year before the merge. He published his paper to get some of the community input on the proof-of-stake Ethereum based on this protocol.

Well, lo and behold, me and my students find a few attacks on this protocol. It's not secure. So we go and contact Vitalik, and we realized that he was actually trying to fix the protocol. After six months, we came up with even more attacks. And then he realized that maybe it's not a good idea for him to go and not communicate with us and just fix the protocol by himself. And so we started one year long collaboration on how to improve the Ethereum proof-of-stake protocol. In that process though, since we engaged with the Ethereum Foundation very closely, Vitalik and his team, we learn a lot about how to build good proof-of-stake protocol and also the security vulnerability of proof-of-stake protocol. Babylon [inaudible 00:07:24] is like a combination of our first love, which is Bitcoin, and our understanding of the limitation and the advantages of proof-of-stake protocols, and sort of marry the two together to build better and more secure protocols.

Ian:

Amazing. What were some of the vulnerabilities in the protocol that you discovered in your work with Vitalik?

David:

So there are two vulnerabilities that we discovered. One is that in a proof-of-stake protocol, typically you want to... It goes back to the theme of this idea of Bitcoin is very slow. Proof-of-stake protocol tries to be fast. You want to confirm like a few seconds. And to confirm fast, you have to have a lot of people voting. But if you design a protocol incorrectly, then when a lot of people are voting, it is easy to have a deadlock because half the people think, ""We should go this way,"" the other half thinks you should go that way, and now you're stuck. The protocol is not moving forward. And the attacks we find are basically these kind of attacks where we can stall the Ethereum protocol. And this attack does not happen in Bitcoin precisely because you only have one vote every 10 minutes.

And so therefore, this stalling is very hard to do because the voting is so slow.

Ian:

That is fascinating. So now maybe diving into BabylonChain a little bit, I think most people listening to this podcast are familiar at least with the basic idea that the Ethereum network, when we talk about staking, there's network staking where you're depositing 32 ETH to actually operate a validator node, and that in turn secures the network. You have people who have a financial incentive to not produce illegitimate blocks on the chain because it will risk their deposited assets. They're held in the validator node. So when we talk about being able to support proof-of-stake with a non-native asset like Bitcoin, the first question that came to my mind was, well, how do I get Bitcoin from the Bitcoin network over onto this other network so that I can deposit into a node for a validator? But I think you've proposed a different style of architecture here.

David:

So people's mind, they try to fit into an existing model. So as you-

... just said, the existing model is that the ETH is sitting on the Ethereum and they're providing security to Ethereum. Now I want Bitcoin to secure Ethereum or secure any proof-of-stake chain. So the natural idea would be to move the Bitcoin onto Ethereum in order to provide a security. But the moving-

... of the Bitcoin is through a technology called bridge. This would be a Bitcoin bridge. Now, once you [inaudible 00:10:22] bridge to Bitcoin holders, then you lose like 95% of the people already.

Bitcoin holders do not want to bridge. And that's one reason why Bitcoin, the asset, is kind of have a very low utilization because there's nothing much happening on Bitcoin. People don't want to move the Bitcoin to other chains. So they're stuck. They say, ""It's fine. We just wait for the Bitcoin value to keep on going up."" People, when you ask them, ""What do you do with Bitcoin?"" They say, ""It's just in my cold wallet.""

So therefore, our solution, when we think about this problem, we don't want to bridge the Bitcoin. So the Bitcoin actually remains to be on the Bitcoin chain. Now, to achieve that, we need to have two properties for the Bitcoin. So we are thinking about the staking process at a more abstract level than the mechanics of where to put the Bitcoin, who to validate, who to hold that Bitcoin, right? At a high level, what do you want? Right? At a high level, what we want is two things. One is that the staker should need to lock the Bitcoin or log the stake so that they can't take it out arbitrarily. And that locking can then provide the security, number one. Number two is that that asset should be a true collateral in a sense that if the validator that the staking is supporting is doing bad behavior, that fraction of that Bitcoin should be sent to, say, some burn address to punish the staker. And that provides the collateralization of the security. So those are two abstract properties.

So we find that we can achieve properties by keeping the Bitcoin on the Bitcoin chain. The first property is through a Bitcoin opcode called timelock. So in Bitcoin, you can lock your Bitcoin. So if you're bored, you can actually lock your Bitcoin for one year, and then only after one year you can take the money out. No else can take it in the meantime though. So you can use this lock to implement the first objective.

... had to implement or introduce. You're just leveraging a feature that's always been-

David:

Yeah. So a little bit of technical jargon in the Bitcoin world called Bitcoin scripting language, it's like a smart contract language analog from Ethereum. The thing is it's not very smart, but limited language. Now, in this scripting language, there are certain opcodes, operation codes, that allows people to program in an efficient manner. And one of the opcodes is this notion of timelock. So if we use this opcode, we lock for a certain amount and we release only after this amount of time. So this is already there in the Bitcoin scripting language.

However, the challenge is actually not the timelock which Bitcoin has, but how do you achieve this collateralization property, this slashing? Because this property on the proof-of-stake chain, which is the outside world, and we need to reflect what happens in the outside world, what happens on the Bitcoin proof-of-work chain, which is to slash the Bitcoin. And that is the core of our innovation to do that, and we do that in cryptography to turn this bad events signal from the proof-of-stake chain into something that leads to expanding of a [inaudible 00:13:34]. So that is the secret. It's not a secret, but it's the magical source of our technology.

Ian:

And this leads me to my next question. So if you've got this financial incentive, I want to be able to take my Bitcoin and do something with it. So presumably, by supplying it to secure another network, I'm going to earn some rewards similar to how people staking on Ethereum earn staking rewards. You also want to have a financial penalty for people who are not operating honestly. So trying to produce a fake block or perhaps just operating casually. They don't respond to block creation requests or to validation requests effectively. You want to be able to take some or all of the financial asset that they've locked into the chain from them.

So you've got this incentive penalty structure laid out. I, as a user with Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network, can then use Babylon to enter into this contract. With my assets are timelocked, so I'm committing to a particular period of time the asset's available. How though am I doing validations of blocks being created on another network? Is there a piece of infrastructure that I have to run as a user? Do I end up running a validator node on one of these other networks?

This is fascinating. So much like in the world of Ethereum where many people don't actually operate their own node. They delegate. You have the same delegator architecture here. Explain what is actually the architecture of BabylonChain then. And where do those interactions between both the Bitcoin network and off to a network that's using this staked Bitcoin in order to secure itself... How did those happen? Can you describe what BabylonChain actually is? How does the BabylonChain ultimately interface to another network that it's securing in order to provide that security? What does the mechanism of communication and how do those interactions occur?

Thank you. That clarifies a misunderstanding that I had, for sure. So the Bitcoin staking protocol actually runs entirely on the network using the Bitcoin scripting layer?

BabylonChain today is almost a proof of concept implementation so that you can go demonstrate to other chains, ""Hey, look how you can use Bitcoin to secure a proof-of-stake network."" Got it. That's really fascinating. So what has been the reception since you've launched? I think right now, you're kind of in the testnet phase of availability. Are people clamoring for the opportunity to start using Bitcoin to secure other networks?

David:

I should separate [inaudible 00:21:13] into two parts, right? One is if you think about Babylon the protocol, it's like a marketplace and there's a supplier in this house who is Bitcoin, and they're the consumers. The consumers [inaudible 00:21:27] that will receive the security. In the first instance, the suppliers, we find a lot of interest of people with a lot of Bitcoin to gain some sort of... Whenever we talk to people with a lot of Bitcoin, we first ask, ""What do you do with the Bitcoin right now?"" And inadvertently, the answer is nothing.

We've been talking to Bitcoin holders for a year now or nine months, and I would say 99%, the answer is no. They used to be putting in lending protocols, some CS and so forth, and you know what happened to those. So it's after those, all right? So nothing. Find a way to make Bitcoin work for them. However, they're very conservative with the Bitcoin. They don't want to put it in some lending protocol where they lose the Bitcoin or put in some bridge where the bridge is a hack and they lose the Bitcoin. [inaudible 00:22:31] way of earning huge amount of yield, but reasonable, in my view. I think that's sort of what it seems that a lot people are interested in.

So Babylon protocol provide that. And when we launched our testnet, we could encourage people to stake on our testnet, and 100,000 people staked in the first two days. We know because we have an NFT campaign where the first 100,000 stakers can claim an NFT. So I think there's a lot of interest from the supply side. Now, from the demand side, which is the blockchains, there, we have a project. And one particular area that receive a lot of interest is this so-called Bitcoin L2. So Bitcoin is undergoing a certain revival. With the Bitcoin ETF, there's a renewed interest. When we started doing research five years ago, people thought we were stupid working on Bitcoin as everyone moved on. But you know what happened was that Bitcoin is back.

And there are a lot of new projects building on Bitcoin. And so we become like a go-to marketplace for all these new projects to get security, Bitcoin staking. And so we receive a lot of attention there. On the other side, we have a collaboration with the Cosmos Hub, which is the main Cosmos chain, and they want to share the security of Bitcoin so that they also use that to secure other Cosmos chain. And so I think there are a lot of... In fact, we are really limited right now in terms of team members. So the way anyone listen to this and they're interested in participating in Babylon, come and talk to me.

Ian:

That's exciting. It's nice to hear people having the we're hiring advertisement on this program again. It'd slowed down there for a little while. So anybody out there looking for a new role in Web3, it sounds like BabylonChain needs engineers. I saw a press release from a few weeks back where you partnered with Nubit to support their technology layer. And I gather that Nubit is a data availability layer, so related to some of the NFT ordinal type work on Bitcoin. Can you talk a bit more about what that integration actually enables?

David:

Nubit is a good example. So Nubit is a new project that is building on Bitcoin. And basically, Bitcoin itself, the [inaudible 00:25:01] space is very limited. So now imagine you want to build new projects and new applications on top of Bitcoin. You are using that space that is extremely crowded. And so Nubit builds a so-called data availability layer where projects can use Bitcoin asset, but at the same time use Nubit to store data onto the Bitcoin chain directly. So that Nubit is so-called data availability layer.

Now, this is part of this whole idea of so-called modular design of consensus protocol where you separate out different funds for different projects to do. Now, data availability layer itself needs security. Every essentially modular component needs security. Otherwise, people who are doing data availability would do weird things. And the Babylon integration is that Babylon would take big Bitcoin staking to secure the Nubit data availability layer. I'm just saying that this is a good example of a naturally used staking as a security mechanism.

Ian:

Now, you're still in the testnet phase right now. What's the plan to get from here to mainnet? When should we expect to see the start being available in production?

David:

So the testnet has the dog food chain, BabylonChain, it has the Bitcoin scripting staking. So it's a full system. Now, we want to move this to the mainnet. So mainnet means what? Mainnet means real Bitcoin. Now, real Bitcoin and test Bitcoin is quite different. Real Bitcoin is gold and test Bitcoin is like... I guess this is a... We should know the language.

Yes. Whenever they were real Bitcoin, we would be very careful. So therefore-

... we decided to launch the mainnet in two phases. So in the first phase, we take only the scripting part, the staking part, and launch it as mainnet.... Bitcoin holders can come in and they'll stake their Bitcoin and they'll launch through our contract. This phase one. This phase one will be around a short time, maybe three months. And then once we get people used to locking real Bitcoin into this contract, then we'll launch the Babylon first chain, and then the validators will start validating.

Ian:

So we're talking before the end of the year, we should have this both phases live, it sounds like, from what-

David:

Yeah. So mainnet phase one, we're shooting for June right now.

We'll be having four security auditors look at this code in different ways, some white hats, some gray box analysis, some code by-line biases. Very important because we don't want to lose people's Bitcoin. So this will be done probably near the second half of May timeframe, and then we'll launch in June the mainnet phase.

Ian:

That's exciting. A question that just occurred to me is, so once I've locked my Bitcoin, I'm now earning rewards. What are the rewards paid in? What asset do I actually get rewarded with?

David:

So it depends on now the chain that you secure. So in the BabylonChain... So let's think about Bitcoin staking to secure or improve the security of the Cosmos Hub. Now, the Cosmos Hub have a native token already called ATOM. And every year, they're inflating ATOM by about 10%. That's the inflation rate of ATOM. And most of that 10% goes to the ATOM stakers right now. So when we have Bitcoin staking integrated with them in production, then the proposal right now is 1% of this 10%. So one versus nine. The 1% of the ATOM inflation will go and reward the Bitcoin stakers. The reward will come in terms of tokens.

A different application though, for example, you may have a chain running a stable coin. Then the reward could be different in terms of the stable coin itself. So they reward you very much on the application and the economy that you're securing on that chain.

Ian:

And how does one choose which application or ecosystem they're staking? When I enter into that locking contract, am I making a conscious decision or does this happen automatically where my assets are just distributed across anywhere there's demand for security?

David:

So you are typically delegating to a validator. And the validator will be securing certain number of chains. And so in some sense, you're picking the chain and picking the validator that you like to secure. I want to secure-

... the Cosmos Hub and I want to use the Figment validator, for example.

Ian:

So you have to know a bit about the ecosystem that you're planning to support, right? Because you could have potentially an asset that's not really worth anything, has no exchangeable value, I guess I could say.

Which may be less economically interesting to somebody looking to earn an interest return on the staked asset, if I'm following correctly. You need to do some research, it sounds like.

David:

Yeah. It could be a blue chip token like ATOM, which people are familiar with, or-

... it could be a new and hottest project you want to get reward in the new token because you think that that token is going to be valuable.

Ian:

And is the project open source? Or if someone wants to adopt, support for this, what is the process? If I'm building a new project, I listen to the podcast, I say, ""This sounds great."" How does one go about getting started?

David:

I mean, eventually, you want the complete open source and where you can integrate this. But right now, we are working with projects to help them to do the integration. So I think the first step is probably approach us because of open source. Yes.

Ian:

Amazing. And what's the best way to get in touch with you or the broader team? Just babylonchain.io?

David:

You can also send us a contact message through the babylonchain.io website.

Ian:

Amazing. David, this has been a fantastic conversation. My last question, what are you excited about as you look across the ecosystem? You're so deep into this entire world. What should we be paying attention to over the rest of 2024?

David:

2024 is, I think, the year of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is back. So we see a lot of-

... interesting new projects building on Bitcoin right now, and it's still a huge number of projects. So I think there'll be a lot of excitement about new protocols of Bitcoin, perhaps even some upgrade on the Bitcoin chain to enable even more new building of Bitcoin. So I think there'll be a lot of activities around Bitcoin.

How to Buy Stacks (STX) * Step-by-step Guide * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-stacks-stx,2024-09-17,Benzinga,"Stacks has ignited excitement among Bitcoin maximalists due to its potential to deliver smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain while preserving the integrity and performance of the Bitcoin mainnet. Unlike Ethereum, where smart contracts directly on the mainnet have led to network congestion and spiraling fees, Stacks operates as a second layer, allowing for efficient execution of smart contracts without overwhelming Bitcoin's core system.

This innovative approach not only enhances scalability but also opens the door to decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions on Bitcoin. Learn more about Stacks and how to buy STX below.

If you're interested in purchasing Stacks coin, you can follow these easy steps.

Opening a crypto account is the first step to acquiring STX tokens. As a U.S. resident, you'll have to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) know your customer (KYC) regulations. For tax purposes, you'll need to supply the cryptocurrency exchange with your Social Security number, address and a photo of your driver's license. The verification process usually takes a few days.

Before you can start buying cryptocurrency, you'll need to fund your trading account. Most platforms offer a variety of payment methods to facilitate this process. You can choose from funding options such as wire transfer, credit card, debit card, or even crypto deposits.

It's important to follow the platform's specific instructions for your chosen payment method. After entering the amount you wish to deposit, take a moment to review any transaction fees that may apply, as these can vary depending on the payment method and the platform. Once you've ensured that everything is correct, you can complete the transaction and begin your journey into the world of cryptocurrency trading.

Now that you have funded your account, you're ready to make your purchase. Access the trade section of the platform. Search for Stacks or STX. Place a buy order for your desired amount. Carefully review all details before finalizing the transaction.

Stacks is a Layer 1 blockchain that leverages the security of the Bitcoin blockchain using a novel consensus mechanism called Proof of Transaction (PoX). Essentially, the Stacks blockchain acts as a computation layer while using Bitcoin's blockchain as a settlement layer.

STX is the native asset of the Stacks blockchain. The Stacks blockchain is unique -- it has both miners and stakers, or at least a version of both.

In the Stacks ecosystem, you have two options that let you earn interest on your digital assets:

Mining: Stacks' miners incorporate BTC into the ecosystem for the purpose of leveraging Bitcoin's proof of work (PoW) security. You can commit Bitcoin to the chain for the chance to earn the Stacks block reward, known as mining. This Bitcoin will be given to stackers as a reward for achieving consensus.

Stacking: You can stake STX and earn BTC provided by miners, known as ""stacking."" Similar to most proof of stake (PoS) blockchains, stacking allows holders to provide security and earn interest. Unlike most PoS chains, STX stakers earn BTC as a reward.

Stacks was founded as ""Blockstacks"" at Princeton in 2013 by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea. Blockstacks received seed funding from Y Combinator in 2014, and completed a $4 million Series A capital raise in 2016. A year later in 2017, Blockstacks raised $50 million via a private token sale.

In 2018, Stacks launched its testnet and integrated with Gaia, the decentralized storage platform, for data management. Later that year, the Stacks blockchain went live.

Stacks's 2019 public token sale was the first ever ICO commissioned by the SEC. The token became officially recognized as a security and therefore unable to be traded on U.S. based cryptocurrency exchanges.

As of writing, the token is trading for around $1.53 and has market capitalization of over $2.2 billion. STX is currently ranking 35th among the top cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.

Consider below options for some of the best crypto exchanges that support Stacks coin.

While most crypto exchanges are happy to take custody of your assets for you, best practice is purchasing your own cryptocurrency wallet. A cold storage wallet should be used for large amounts of money, while hot wallets work great for smaller amounts dedicated to trading or earning interest.

Ledger is a well-known hardware wallet that primarily operates offline but also offers Bluetooth and USB connectivity for computer or mobile use. Its application simplifies the security, storage, and management of assets.

Coinbase Wallet is a user-friendly app that allows users to store cryptocurrencies in their own custody, separate from the Coinbase platform. It enables easy management of digital assets, including DeFi and NFTs, all from one location.

If you want to exit your STX position, you can follow the purchasing process in reverse order. First, transfer your STX from your wallet back to your exchange wallet, then place a sell order. Now that you're back in USD, you can transfer your funds back to your bank account.

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, with daily price fluctuations, especially among smaller coins. This can result in significant gains or losses quickly, making real-time data essential for investors. Today's price changes reflect this volatility, influenced by market sentiment, regulations, and technology. Investors need to stay alert and continuously track live updates to make informed decisions and protect their portfolios.

Stacks promises to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin. If they're at all successful in achieving their goal, the network could grow exponentially in the coming years. If Ethereum's success is any indication of the potential of blockchain smart contracts, then Stacks could be the most lucrative investment of the next decade.

That being said, Ethereum's comparatively mature DeFi ecosystem and loyal community will be hard to displace. Stacks is a high-risk investment, so only invest money you're okay with losing.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/03114206/Stacks.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.3490196078431373

Looking to add Compound (COMP) to your portfolio? Our guide simplifies the process of buying Compound, ensuring you make informed decisions in your investment journey.

Ready to invest in Compound? Follow these simple steps to get started.

Before you can invest in Compound, you'll typically want to open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that supports COMP trading. Go to the website or download the mobile app of your chosen platform. You must provide an email address and password. In the United States, regulations require cryptocurrency exchanges to verify user identities before trading. This process typically involves submitting your address, Social Security number and a photo of your driver's license or another valid ID. After you submit the required documents, the platform will review your account. Once verification is complete, you will be able to start trading.

You will need to fund your account before you can start buying your desired crypto. Most trading platforms offer various payment methods, including bank transfers, credit cards, debit cards and crypto deposits from external exchanges or wallets.

Choose your preferred payment method. Carefully follow the platform's instructions for the deposit process. Enter the desired amount and review any transaction fees before completing the transaction. Be aware that fees may vary based on your selected payment method and the platform's policies.

After your account has been set up and funded, go to the trade section of the platform. Search for Compound or COMP and place a buy order depending on your desired amount. Make sure to review all the details before finalizing your transaction.

When most people think of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, their minds immediately go to anonymous payment methods. For example, you can send Bitcoin to your friend using the Bitcoin network instead of a centralized payment system. However, financial institutions do much more than only facilitate payments between two parties -- they also provide checking and savings account services, loans and more.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) sphere intends to use blockchain technology and the Ethereum network to provide a full range of decentralized services that would typically be provided by a bank or other central service. Compound is a lending platform built on the Ethereum network that provides peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan services. Compound users can lock in collateral and provide loans to other users in exchange for a predetermined interest rate based on market demand. The Compound token (COMP) acts as a governance token that provides owners with voting rights. COMP is an ERC-20 token, and is currently the 138th largest cryptocurrency project when measured by total market capitalization. The token is trading for around $42.84 and has market capitalization of over $376 million.

The Ethereum Bulls Come Out To Support New ETH Gambling ICO Mpeppe Currently at $0.0021 | Bitcoinist.com,https://bitcoinist.com/the-ethereum-bulls-come-out-to-support-new-eth-gambling-ico-mpeppe-currently-at-0-0021/,2024-09-17,Bitcoinist.com,"The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic space, where new projects with high potential emerge constantly. As seasoned investors seek fresh opportunities, it appears that the latest buzz is surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new decentralized gambling token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. With a current price of $0.0021, this ICO has piqued the interest of Ethereum bulls who are backing Mpeppe for its promising future.

Despite its historic dominance in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has recently faced significant challenges. As of September 16, 2024, Ethereum (ETH) saw a price dip of nearly 6% in 24 hours, dropping to $2,272. This decline mirrors the broader market's bearish movement, which has impacted major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). ETH investors have been closely monitoring the situation as Ethereum (ETH)'s price slid from a high of $2,424.43 to a low of $2,253.71 in a single day.

Much of this movement has been attributed to a range of factors, including $12.92 million outflows from Ethereum-focused ETFs and general market jitters ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy meeting (FOMC). Nevertheless, Ethereum (ETH)'s bulls remain hopeful for a recovery, with some optimistic projections suggesting that ETH could surge to $10,000 by the end of 2024. In the meantime, savvy Ethereum (ETH) holders are turning their attention to other high-potential assets like Mpeppe (MPEPE), eager to capitalize on the upside while Ethereum (ETH) navigates turbulent waters.

Mpeppe (MPEPE) has rapidly gained attention as a promising new ICO in the decentralized gambling sector. Built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to revolutionize the online gambling industry by offering provably fair gaming and leveraging smart contracts for transparency. The token's unique proposition has attracted Ethereum (ETH) investors, who are always on the lookout for projects with solid growth potential.

At a current price of $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents an early-stage opportunity for investors. As the ICO progresses, many Ethereum (ETH) holders have doubled their Mpeppe (MPEPE) holdings, confident that this project will experience exponential growth in the coming months. With Ethereum (ETH) bulls backing Mpeppe (MPEPE), the token is poised for a major breakout, particularly as it draws from Ethereum (ETH)'s robust network and liquidity.

Ethereum (ETH) holders are known for being early adopters of promising blockchain projects. Their involvement in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and now decentralized gambling has helped foster the growth of numerous successful ventures. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is no exception. As Ethereum struggles to regain its momentum in the short term, ETH holders are diversifying their portfolios by backing Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its high-growth potential.

The decentralized gambling market is estimated to grow significantly in the next few years, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a key player in this sector. With Ethereum (ETH)'s smart contract capabilities and the trust that the ETH blockchain provides, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers investors the chance to participate in an emerging market that could rival traditional online casinos. By doubling their Mpeppe (MPEPE) holdings, Ethereum (ETH) investors are positioning themselves for potential gains while the broader cryptocurrency market continues to evolve.

Despite Ethereum's current struggles, many investors remain confident in the long-term potential of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum's robust ecosystem, including decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects, and its transition to Ethereum 2.0, has cemented its role as a foundational layer for blockchain innovation. As of now, Ethereum's market cap stands at $273.94 billion, and though its price has dipped below $2,300, the long-term outlook for ETH remains optimistic.

Some analysts are projecting that Ethereum could break through the $10,000 mark by the end of 2024, contingent on Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new highs and the overall crypto market seeing renewed bullish sentiment. Factors such as Ethereum-focused ETFs, increased institutional adoption, and continued growth in the DeFi space could all serve as catalysts for this price increase.

However, in the short term, Ethereum's price is likely to remain volatile. Many ETH whales have been moving their holdings to exchanges like Coinbase, reflecting a bearish sentiment in the market. Yet, even amid these challenges, Ethereum's resilience as a leading blockchain network gives it a strong foundation for recovery.

For Ethereum holders, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a balanced strategy. By maintaining core holdings in Ethereum, which is a more established asset, while allocating capital to a high-potential ICO like Mpeppe, investors can mitigate risk while positioning themselves for substantial gains. Mpeppe's innovative approach to decentralized gambling, combined with its Ethereum-based infrastructure, offers a unique value proposition that traditional gambling platforms cannot match.

As the ICO continues and Mpeppe's price moves closer to its projected target of $0.00235, Ethereum investors who have already backed the token are likely to see significant returns. The combination of Ethereum's stability and Mpeppe's growth potential makes this a winning strategy for those looking to navigate the current market turbulence.

Ethereum (ETH) may be facing short-term challenges, but its community of investors continues to seek out innovative projects that offer higher returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its current price of $0.0021, is one such project that has garnered the support of Ethereum bulls. As the decentralized gambling sector grows and Mpeppe gains traction, ETH holders are doubling down on this promising ICO. With Ethereum's long-term prospects still strong and Mpeppe's growth potential clear, the combination of these two assets could yield impressive returns for investors in the months to come.

A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Investment in 2024,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/09/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-investment-in-2024,2024-09-17,cryptodaily.co.uk,"Feeling overwhelmed by cryptocurrency investing in 2024? You're not alone. With over 2.4 million cryptocurrencies now available, it's enough to make anyone's head spin. I remember how confusing it all seemed when I first started out.

But don't worry - I'm here to help guide you through the crypto landscape. In this article, I'll share my personal experiences and research to help you start your crypto journey. We'll cover the basics, talk about the risks involved, and walk through the steps to make informed decisions.

So, are you ready to explore the exciting (and sometimes perplexing) world of crypto investing?

Before you invest in crypto, you need to know some key things. I'll share two vital points to think about as you start your crypto journey.

Understanding Blockchain Technology

I want to explain blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies. It's a distributed ledger system that records all transactions across a network of computers. This tech ensures secure, transparent, and unchangeable records without a central authority.

Blockchain powers Bitcoin, the first crypto created in 2009, and enables cheap, global payments with high security.

Blockchain's key features make it ideal for more than just digital money. It supports decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts, as seen with Ethereum. These expand blockchain's use beyond finance.

But it's important to note that blockchain transactions can't be reversed and lack buyer protection. This makes understanding the tech crucial before investing.

Blockchain is to Bitcoin, what the internet is to email. A big electronic system, on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one. - Sally Davies, FT Technology Reporter

Evaluating Cryptocurrency Market Trends

Moving from blockchain basics, I'll now focus on evaluating cryptocurrency market trends. This skill is crucial for any crypto trader in 2024.

I've seen the crypto market change a lot since I started trading. Right now, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether lead the pack in market cap. But things can shift fast. Last year, I watched values drop sharply after big gains.

It's a young market, full of surprises. That's why I always check the top 10 cryptos and their recent performance before making moves. I also keep an eye on regulations. The lack of rules makes the future unclear, which affects prices.

For new traders, I suggest sticking to big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum at first. They're more stable in this wild market.

How to Start Investing in Cryptocurrency

Starting to invest in cryptocurrency is easier than you might think. I'll show you how to pick a good crypto exchange and decide how much to invest.

Choosing the Right Crypto Exchange

I've found that choosing the right crypto exchange is crucial for a smooth investment journey. My go-to options include Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. These platforms are regulated and reputable, which gives me peace of mind about the safety of my funds.

I always make sure to use strong passwords and enable two-factor verification for extra security.

Security is paramount when selecting a crypto exchange.

For those who prefer more control, decentralized exchanges (DEX) offer an alternative to centralized platforms. However, I stick to centralized exchanges (CEX) like Coinbase or Binance for their user-friendly interfaces and better liquidity.

After trading, I transfer my assets to a self-custody wallet for long-term storage, adding an extra layer of protection to my investments.

Deciding on Investment Amounts

After selecting a crypto exchange, I needed to decide how much to invest. My first rule: never put in more than I can afford to lose. I've learned that experts suggest allocating 1% to 5% of net worth to crypto.

For me, this meant starting small and growing my investment over time.

I factor in my budget, risk tolerance, and strategy when deciding amounts. Transaction costs and minimum thresholds also play a role. Many platforms let me buy fractional amounts, which is great for testing the waters.

I aim to keep any single crypto at 2% or less of my total portfolio. This approach helps me manage risk while exploring the potential of digital assets.

Maintaining and Securing Your Investment

I keep my crypto investments safe by using secure wallets. I also track how well my investments are doing to make smart choices.

Using Secure Wallets

I use secure wallets to protect my cryptocurrency investments. These wallets come in two main types: hot wallets connected to the internet and cold wallets stored offline. For everyday trading, I opt for software wallets on my devices.

But for larger holdings, I prefer hardware wallets that offer extra security. I often combine both methods to balance ease of use and safety.

Keeping my digital assets safe is crucial. I never leave large amounts on exchanges. Instead, I transfer them to self-custody wallets where I control the private keys. I always use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for added protection.

By following these steps, I ensure my cryptocurrencies stay secure and under my control.

Monitoring Investment Performance

After securing my crypto assets in a safe wallet, I focus on monitoring my investment performance. I track my portfolio's value daily and compare it to market trends. This helps me spot any sudden changes or potential issues quickly.

I use tools to analyze my investments' returns and adjust my strategy as needed. The crypto market's high volatility means I must stay alert and ready to adapt. I set clear goals and regularly check if I'm meeting them.

By keeping a close eye on my investments, I can make smart choices for long-term growth in this fast-paced market.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrency investment presents promising opportunities for growth in 2024. I've outlined essential steps to begin your path into this digital landscape. It's crucial to educate yourself, prioritize security, and make informed decisions.

With caution and insight, you can participate in the cryptocurrency market. Continuously learn and adjust as the market shifts to maximize your investment potential.

Increasing Need to Prevent Data Tampering Driving the Adoption of Blockchain Technology in the Healthcare Sector

The growing popularity of cryptocurrency and the need to prevent data tampering in the healthcare sector are key factors increasing the adoption of blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have gained traction in recent years, showcasing the potential of decentralized digital currencies that rely on blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions. Data integrity and security are of paramount importance in the healthcare sector. Medical records, clinical trial data, and patient information must be protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or alteration. With blockchain technology, healthcare organizations can securely store and share patient records, ensuring the security and integrity of sensitive information. The distributed nature of blockchain technology eliminates the reliance on a single centralized authority, reducing the risk of data manipulation or tampering. The players in this market are focused on launching new offerings for healthcare applications. For instance, in October 2020, IBM Watson Health (U.S.) launched a blockchain-powered digital health pass. This digital health initiative was aimed at allowing users to share their verified health status without exposing the data used to generate it.

Is Bitcoin Going To Be The Only Trustless Digital Store Of Value?,https://www.benzinga.com/partner/cryptocurrency/24/09/40876645/is-bitcoin-going-to-be-the-only-trustless-digital-store-of-value,2024-09-16,Benzinga,"As the world's first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has captured much of the digital asset spotlight since its inception in 2008, serving as a digital store of value and inflationary hedge. The leading cryptocurrency by size has seen its market capitalization balloon as high as $1.44 trillion at its peak earlier in 2024. The price has since retreated from those high levels, and the value of the broader crypto market now hovers at approximately $2 trillion as of Sep. 12, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

With a dominance between 40%-50% as of the time of writing, Bitcoin is still the most widely held cryptocurrency in the world. However, Bitcoin is not the only horse in the digital asset race. Instead, it shares the stage with thousands of other cryptocurrencies that were developed in its wake, known as altcoins. Yet another segment of cryptocurrencies consists of what are called stablecoins, which are backed by fiat money and tend to exhibit less volatility than Bitcoin and other digital assets. Not to be outdone, Seasonal Tokens arrived on the scene, which are intended to be ethical tools for wealth building through trading in digital assets.

Some BTC maximalists, as they're known, are convinced there's only room for one leader over the long haul, and that's Bitcoin, while all other coins will eventually fall by the wayside. With the cryptocurrency markets clearly evolving, now is a good time to explore whether Bitcoin will reign as the only trustless digital store of value or if there's room for other tokens to exist alongside it.

Multiple factors support the assertion that Bitcoin's dominance isn't likely to threaten the existence or success of altcoins.

Cryptocurrency Market Share Pie

It's undeniable that Bitcoin has played a major role in the growth of the cryptocurrency market. As the Bitcoin price has risen over the years, so too has the size of the broader digital asset market, fueled by Bitcoin on one hand and the performance of other tokens on the other. However, it's important to note that as of Sep. 12, 2024, Bitcoin's dominance hovers at less than 50% compared with 85% five years ago. As Bitcoin's dominance has been slipping, that of the altcoin market has been rising, a trend that is reflected in the below chart.

Image source: CoinGecko

Take Bitcoin's halving events, a supply phenomenon that occurs every four years and tends to be bullish for the Bitcoin price. Leading up to and after the Bitcoin halving events of 2017 and 2021, the altcoin market cap expanded alongside a rising Bitcoin price. This suggests that investors were also looking for cheaper alternatives to the pricey leading crypto.

Based on this trend, it's also possible that the altcoin share of the broader cryptocurrency market could be poised to continue rising going forward. Consider the total crypto market share pie witnessed in Q3 2024 in which Bitcoin holds roughly half, while the seven leading altcoins control a combined 25% and the remaining cryptocurrencies hold the other 25%.

What sets Bitcoin apart from the pack is its inherent use case as a payment method. A common thread among seven of the top eight cryptocurrencies is that they each operate on their own unique blockchains. Other major blockchains more closely resemble Ethereum, the number two cryptocurrency by market cap that also serves as a decentralized virtual computer. This differentiator is a major driver of price for the underlying tokens.

However, these alone may not be enough to form a full picture of the altcoin market's expected growth pattern. Therefore, let's explore some reasons to support this likely scenario.

Reasons The Altcoin Market Can Be Expected To Expand

Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency whose transactions underpin the Bitcoin blockchain. However, with the combination of block-size limitations and a mandated supply cap of 21 million coins ever to be minted, Bitcoin soon evolved as a store of value as well, competing with conventional assets like gold.

Meanwhile, Ethereum, the number two cryptocurrency, was created with a different use case - as a decentralized virtual computer. Most other blockchains followed in Ethereum's footsteps, completing decentralized transactions using products known as smart contracts. Smart contracts became commoditized over time, growing in influence but declining in price. It's a similar phenomenon with other technologies like cars and cell phones, whose use case and price have gone in opposite directions.

Among the leading eight cryptocurrencies, one outlier is Tether (USDT), as unlike the others it is not a blockchain. One of the industry's first stablecoins, Tether was created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain with the primary purpose of payment and acting as a stable digital asset so investors can sidestep volatility. Its existence is a testament to the fact that decentralized virtual computer technology permits the separation of blockchain infrastructure from the underlying cryptocurrencies, the latter of which can perform independently.

This brings us to the Seasonal Tokens project, comprising four proof-of-work tokens - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter - that operate on the Ethereum network. Their relative prices take cues from one another over time. While Bitcoin's primary use case is money, and Ethereum's is a decentralized virtual machine, Seasonal Tokens aim to take the role of more of a trading instrument.

Bitcoin has often been compared with gold. However, Seasonal Tokens also share some similarities with commodities, operating in cryptocurrency similar to how other products like agricultural produce function in the physical world.

In the agricultural industry, farmers rely on the changing of the seasons to inform their growing and harvesting decisions as well as risk taking. Similarly, the nature of changing cycles in the relative prices of Seasonal Tokens guides traders in their decision-making process. One key difference between Seasonal Tokens and nature's seasons is that the crypto cycle unfolds for nine months at a time.

Bitcoin has already succeeded as the most trusted store of value cryptocurrency, earning the nickname of ""digital gold."" However, that is just fine with the altcoin market, as they are not vying for this title. Rather, they serve as a complement to Bitcoin by offering their own value and opportunities to traders.

Seasonal Tokens Built To Create Wealth

As Bitcoin's total supply shrinks every four years like clockwork, the economic incentives for stakeholders will pivot from mining to other things. For example, Bitcoin miners may shift their attention from mining new coins - their primary means of getting paid -- to generating blockchain transaction fees for income. Given the blockchain's limitations on transaction speed, Bitcoin will likely be favored among major industry players, but potentially not for small transactions.

As for Seasonal Tokens, price swings serve as demand drivers for the foreseeable future until the mining supply is less influential. By this time, traders are expected to be incentivized to provide liquidity to decentralized markets as they profit from various blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon while opportunistically trading price changes among the four Seasonal Tokens - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.

In early September, Seasonal Tokens had a major event when the mining supply of the Winter token was halved. This event was a milestone for the project, ushering in the end of the first full period of halvings. Based on historical data, the project's leaders report that the mechanics of Seasonal Tokens are performing like clockwork: the Winter Token shows signs of transforming from the cheapest of the project's four tokens to the most expensive.

Traders may want to stay tuned if they'd like to participate in the synchronized Seasonal Tokens cycles.

How to Buy Neo (NEO) * Step-by-step Guide * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-neo-neo,2024-09-16,Benzinga,"Our team is diligently working to keep up with trends in the crypto markets. Keep up to date on the latest news and up-and-coming coins.

Neo is a direct competitor to Ethereum for creating financial products on a blockchain. It is often referred to as the ""Chinese Ethereum"" due to the Neo Foundation's base in China. Neo offers cheaper transaction costs compared to Ethereum. The platform also has a fund to support ongoing development. As a result, Neo presents an appealing investment opportunity for those who believe another cryptocurrency may eventually surpass Ethereum as the primary platform for decentralized applications (dApps).

Discover the world of NEO with our beginner-friendly guide! Learn how to buy NEO and make informed investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.

Ready to invest in NEO? Follow this step-by-step guide on how to buy NEO safely and effectively.

In order to purchase NEO tokens, you'll need to make an account with a crypto trading platform that supports the trading of the asset. Unfortunately, some major crypto exchanges like Coinbase don't support the trading of NEO, but you can watch the price movements of the token on the Coinbase app. The most popular cryptocurrency exchanges that support NEO are eToro and Binance.

To create an account, you'll need to provide the website or mobile app with information about yourself. The information you provide is for tax purposes, and it's very similar to making an account with a stock brokerage. Some information you'll need to is your Social Security number, address, email address and birthday. You need to verify your account by submitting identification documents to comply with the Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

Now that your account is ready for trading, you'll need to fund it by depositing fiat money or a supported cryptocurrency. Most trading platforms offer a variety of payment methods to facilitate this process, including transferring funds from your bank account, credit card, debit card and cryptocurrency deposits from external exchanges or crypto wallets.

To get started, choose your preferred payment method and carefully follow the platform's instructions for depositing funds. Make sure to enter the desired deposit amount and check for any applicable transaction fees before confirming the transaction, as these fees can vary based on the chosen payment method and platform policies.

With a funded account, you can now start buying crypto. Go to the trade section of your selected platform. Search for NEO and select the option to buy. Enter the amount you wish to purchase. Review the transaction details carefully before executing the order. Once confirmed, NEO will be added to your portfolio. A confirmation email will be sent to you.

In a similar way to stocks, you can buy NEO as a limit order or a market order. Market orders purchase your NEO tokens at the market price which is determined by the highest bid and lowest ask in an exchange's order book. Alternatively, you can buy your NEO using a limit order. Limit orders purchase NEO at a specified price you set when placing your order. If the market price dips to the price you've specified, the order will automatically purchase NEO at that price.

Neo is a blockchain network that competes with Ethereum to provide a platform to build financial infrastructure on. Unlike Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Neo let developers build financial products directly on the blockchain. This eliminates the need for a centralized third party, making a financial ecosystem that is both trustless and permissionless.

A trustless system means that there is no need to trust a third party to operate on your behalf. For example, you need to rely on a cryptocurrency exchange to hold your assets securely and continue supporting the cryptocurrency tokens you're invested in. Instead of a third party controlling your assets, you control your funds with your crypto wallet and transact using code on Neo's blockchain. This code is referred to as smart contracts, as they're capable of handling assets on the blockchain.

Neo's network provides a permissionless financial system for anyone who can access the platform's smart contracts. Unlike an exchange or bank, you can use a smart contract without having to gain ""permission"" by making an account or submitting paperwork.

NEO was initially released as Antshares back in 2014. The blockchain company is based out of China and is believed to be the first public blockchain to be developed in the country. In 2017, Antshares rebranded to Neo and quickly appreciated from sub $1 prices to almost $200 at its peak.

Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang are the co-founders of Neo. They operate the Neo Foundation, which is used to facilitate upgrades to Neo and aid in the adoption of Neo's network. Currently, NEO is trading for around $9.28 and has a market capitalization of about $654 million, placing it at 88th spot in the top cryptocurrencies based on market cap.

The second token on Neo's network is NeoGAS. NeoGAS is similar to Ethereum's gas, but it's not directly linked to the NEO token. NeoGAS is used to purchase computational power for transactions and smart contracts, ""fueling"" the network.

Here are some platforms to consider for your NEO crypto investment. These platforms offer various features to help you get started. Make sure to evaluate each option based on your investment goals and preferences. Consider factors such as fees, user interface, and support services when making your choice.

If you don't plan on actively trading your cryptocurrency, you should store your crypto assets on a dedicated crypto wallet. Storing your funds on a cryptocurrency exchange puts your digital assets at risk of being stolen, as hackers may be able to breach the exchange's security. The two main types of cryptocurrency wallets are hardware and software wallets.

Software wallets are programs for storing funds on devices and offer more security than exchanges. Hardware wallets, which are physical devices that store crypto offline, provide the highest level of security for NEO tokens. Check out a few of our recommended wallets for Neo.

Ledger is an affordable hardware wallet that supports a variety of altcoins. Its Ledger Live platform allows you to download applications for lesser-known crypto assets. Ledger offers two models of cryptocurrency wallets: the Nano S, which is the basic model focusing on security and simplicity, and the Nano X, which includes Bluetooth and a larger screen at a higher price. Both models support major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.

Binance Wallet is an exchange wallet that holds your crypto assets off the cryptocurrency exchange. If you choose to use Binance to buy and sell NEO, it's a great option to store your cryptocurrency since it's so convenient. Also, Binance is one of the few wallets that lets you earn NEOgas, which is deposited to your wallet on the second day of each month.

If you plan on day trading your NEO, then you'll need to keep your crypto on an exchange. You can't trade cryptocurrencies from most crypto wallets, but some high-tech wallets let you exchange crypto using smart contracts. If you're holding your NEO in a crypto wallet, you'll need to send it back to an exchange in order to sell it. To transfer your NEO tokens from your crypto wallet, just enter your exchange's NEO address in your crypto wallet and send it on its way.

To get an idea of how cryptocurrency prices are moving, check out some of the major cryptocurrency prices below.

If you don't think Ethereum will be able to scale in a timely manner, then Neo may be a good investment for you. Right now, Ethereum's market capitalization is over 400 times more than NEO's, and most blockchain developers use Ethereum to build smart contracts. Network effects are an important part of the blockchain industry, and it will be hard for any smart contract-enabled blockchain to replace Ethereum as a decentralized financial service provider.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17110250/neo.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.1450980392156862
Bitcoin vs Ethereum in 2024: Which is the Better Investment?,https://blockchainreporter.net/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-in-2024/,2024-09-16,blockchainreporter,"Bitcoin and Ethereum hold a significant share of the crypto market. While Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency, initiated the crypto trend, Ethereum competes closely with

Bitcoin was launched in January 2009, based on a new idea outlined in a white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. It introduced Bitcoin as an online currency without a central authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Instead of physical coins, all transactions are recorded on a secure public ledger.

While Bitcoin wasn't the first attempt at creating an online currency of this kind, it was the most successful. It has since become the foundation for almost all other cryptocurrencies.

Over time, the idea of a virtual, decentralized currency has gained acceptance among regulators and governments. In January, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading, widening the exposure to big institutional investors.

Bitcoin is protected by cryptography, and transactions are verified through a process called mining. In mining, users compete to solve complex math puzzles using powerful computers to verify transactions. This method of verification is known as proof-of-work (PoW). Once a Bitcoin transaction is recorded on the public ledger, it is permanent and cannot be altered or tampered with in any way.

When a Bitcoin miner successfully adds a block of verified transactions to the blockchain, they earn a reward of newly created Bitcoins. Currently, that reward is 3.125 BTC per block, but it gets cut in half every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin has a fixed limit of 21 million BTC that can never be exceeded. This cap on supply helps prevent inflation, and many Bitcoin investors believe these features will make it a valuable store of wealth over the long term.

Ethereum is a blockchain platform designed to enable smart contracts and secure financial transactions. Its native cryptocurrency is called Ether.

Smart contracts are programs that allow decentralized applications (dApps) to run automatically on a blockchain when specific conditions are met.

The Ethereum network hosts various dApps, including those for gaming, gambling, socializing, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Most non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also built on Ethereum.

Ethereum operates on a global network of thousands of computers, making it decentralized. In 2022, Ethereum switched from a power-hungry proof-of-work (PoW) system to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. In PoS, validators are selected by an algorithm instead of miners solving puzzles. To become a validator, traders must stake some of their cryptocurrency as collateral. The more they stake, the higher their chances of being chosen to validate a block and earn rewards.

In July, the SEC finally approved spot Ethereum ETF trading.

Ether's supply isn't capped, but it's managed through a process called burning. Each time a transaction occurs on Ethereum, users pay a transaction fee, or ""gas."" A portion of this fee is burned, effectively reducing the total supply of ETH. This has sometimes made Ether deflationary, meaning more

Bitcoin's design has some key features that have made it popular as the first digital currency without a central authority.

Blockchain Technology: Bitcoin uses a system called blockchain, which is like a public record book that tracks all transactions. Every time someone makes a transaction, it's added to this record, and everyone can see it. Because it's shared across many computers, it's very hard to change, making it secure. This system allows Bitcoin to work without needing a bank or any central authority, which helps prevent fraud.

Mining Process: Bitcoin works through a process called mining, where people (called miners) use their computers to solve difficult puzzles. When they solve these puzzles, they help verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. In return, they earn new bitcoins as a reward.

Transaction Speed and Scalability: Bitcoin is designed to process a group of transactions every 10 minutes, which limits how many transactions it can handle at once. This has led to discussions about how to make it faster and more efficient. To improve this, solutions like SegWit and the Lightning Network have been introduced.

Scalability Solutions: To handle more transactions more quickly, Bitcoin has introduced tools like the Lightning Network, which allows some transactions to happen outside the main blockchain, making them faster and easier to manage.

Ethereum's design adds several new features that make blockchain technology useful for more than just transactions.

Smart Contracts: One of Ethereum's biggest innovations is smart contracts. These are self-operating contracts where the terms of the agreement are written into the code. They automatically enforce and carry out the terms without needing a middleman, allowing for secure and decentralized transactions.

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM is the environment where smart contracts run on Ethereum. It's like a virtual computer that's built into each Ethereum node and can run contract code. The EVM allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum platform, making it a powerful tool for building various blockchain-based projects.

Shift to Ethereum 2.0: Ethereum has been upgraded to Ethereum 2.0, moving from a Proof of Work (PoW) system to a Proof of Stake (PoS) system. This change is meant to solve issues like scalability, security, and sustainability. Ethereum 2.0 also introduces a technique called sharding, which increases the network's capacity and lowers transaction costs, making the platform more efficient for a wider range of uses.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both well-known cryptocurrencies that run on decentralized blockchain networks, but they have some key differences. Here's how they differ:

The market performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum offers an interesting look into how cryptocurrency markets work, with both experiencing big price changes over time due to various factors.

Bitcoin: Since it started in 2009, Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed, though not without major ups and downs. Its price stayed low until late 2013 when it saw its first big surge. The most notable peak was in late 2017 when Bitcoin's price almost hit $20,000, followed by a steep drop.

In the years that followed, Bitcoin's price continued to fluctuate, reaching record highs above $60,000 in 2021 and again in 2024, showing how volatile but generally upward its market performance has been.

Ethereum: Launched in 2015, Ethereum has also seen a lot of price swings. Its first major rise happened in 2017 during a broader cryptocurrency boom, peaking at around $1,400 in early 2018.

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum's price has had big movements, especially with significant growth in 2020 and 2021, hitting new highs above $4,000, reflecting its increasing use, particularly in the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.

Several key factors drive the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, including market demand, technological upgrades, and investor sentiment.

Market Demand: The demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum is shaped by their perceived value and usefulness. Bitcoin is often viewed as digital gold, a hedge against inflation, and a store of value, leading to higher demand during times of economic uncertainty. Ethereum's demand is boosted by its role in the DeFi and NFT sectors, where it serves as the foundation for many applications and platforms.

Technological Upgrades: Advances and upgrades in technology also impact prices. For Bitcoin, improvements in scalability and security through updates like SegWit and the Lightning Network have positively influenced its price. Ethereum's ongoing upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, efficiency, and sustainability by shifting to Proof of Stake, has been a major factor in its price trends.

Investor Sentiment: How investors feel about the market, influenced by news, regulatory changes, and the economy, greatly affects the prices of both cryptocurrencies. Positive news, such as big institutions adopting the currencies, endorsements from well-known figures, or favorable regulations, can drive prices up. On the other hand, negative news or uncertain regulations can lead to sharp price drops.

As we enter 2024, many crypto enthusiasts and investors are wondering: Should they sell Ethereum for Bitcoin? Has Bitcoin now surpassed Ethereum in long-term growth potential? With Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum by over 44% since the Ethereum Merge, the market is feeling the pressure. Let's take a closer look at the current ETH vs. BTC situation, the potential risks, and what might be ahead for these two leading cryptocurrencies.

A key point is that Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum since the Ethereum Merge nearly two years ago. Data from ultrasound.money shows Bitcoin has gained 44% more than Ethereum since then, raising concerns about Ethereum losing its edge. The main reason for this difference lies in their supply dynamics.

Bitcoin's 2024 halving event cut the creation of new coins in half, making Bitcoin increasingly scarce. Meanwhile, Ethereum's supply has grown, especially after its recent ""Denon"" upgrade. Although Ethereum has burned more ETH than it has issued over time (a deflationary effect), its supply has increased in the short term, which some believe has led to its recent underperformance.

Recent data shows that Ethereum's supply has increased by nearly 1 million ETH in the past year, which is about 1% inflation. While this might seem worrying, it's important to note that since the Ethereum Merge, the total ETH supply has actually decreased by 0.08%. This paints a mixed picture: short-term supply increases may be causing recent underperformance, but the long-term outlook remains deflationary due to the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.

Another factor is the impact of institutional investors and Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum ETFs have seen significant outflows, with over half a billion dollars leaving since their launch. Major institutions like Grayscale have also sold off a large amount of Ethereum, totaling $2.6 billion in outflows since the ETF launch, which has hurt ETH's performance.

However, there's some positive news: BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has brought in about $1 billion in Ethereum ETF inflows, showing that there's still strong interest from major players. While Grayscale is still selling, we might see a shift back to net buying once these sell-offs settle down.

Understanding the difference between short-term inflationary pressures and long-term deflationary trends is crucial to see why Ethereum has struggled recently but could still bounce back in 2024.

Ether has dropped 35% in the last 90 days, while Bitcoin has only fallen by 15% during the same period.

The ETH/BTC ratio has also decreased by about 22% over the past three months, hitting a multi-year low of 0.0405 recently. The drop in the ETH/BTC ratio shows that investors are favoring Bitcoin over Ether, leading to lower demand for Ether. For context, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have been more successful since the SEC approved them on January 10, compared to spot Ethereum ETFs.

According to onchain data provider Glassnode, these ETFs have had a bigger impact on Bitcoin's price (8% of the spot volume) than on Ether's price (only 1% of the spot volume).

""This indicates that interest in the Bitcoin ETF is significantly higher than in the Ethereum ETF.""

Ether's weak performance against Bitcoin has also been affected by Bitcoin's growing dominance in the market.

In 2024, Bitcoin's market dominance increased, hitting a 40-month high of 58% on August 5. This means Bitcoin is gaining strength compared to other cryptocurrencies, including Ether. Bitcoin dominance measures BTC's market cap compared to the total crypto market and is often used by investors to understand market sentiment.

As Bitcoin's dominance continues to rise, ETH's value against Bitcoin is likely to keep dropping, suggesting that investors are more optimistic about Bitcoin and may be investing less in Ether.

Tracking the number of active addresses on a network is a quick and reliable way to see how much the blockchain is being used and how much demand there is for the token.

Currently, the 30-day average of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network is 430K, which is a 7.7% drop from 90 days ago and much lower than the 686K seen in May 2021. This decrease in active addresses suggests that fewer people are using the Ethereum blockchain, leading to fewer Ether transactions. Looking at the number of unique active wallets (UAWs) on Ethereum provides a broader picture of how many decentralized apps (DApps) are being used on the network.

According to DAppRadar, active addresses for Ethereum DApps have fallen by 19% in the past 30 days. This decline is concerning, especially since other blockchains like Solana and Tron saw increases of 257% and 343% in UAWs over the same period. For ETH to rise above $2,400, the network needs to see more growth, more Ether transactions, and increased DApp usage.

So, the big question is: Can Ethereum bounce back and outperform Bitcoin next year? Historically, Ethereum has done better than Bitcoin during bull markets, especially in the years after Bitcoin halving events. The idea is that Ethereum's large ecosystem, which includes decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts, could fuel its growth. However, it's worth noting that Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin for the past three years, which has some investors concerned.

Looking ahead, technical analysis shows that Ethereum is close to a key support level. If it holds, we might see a major price surge, following a pattern seen in previous cycles where Ethereum tests support before jumping in price. Some analysts believe Ethereum could experience another price spike before the end of Q4 2024, assuming favorable macroeconomic conditions.

Looking ahead, many are making bold predictions about the future. The general belief is that Bitcoin could triple or even quadruple in this cycle, possibly reaching as high as $165,000. If Bitcoin hits these levels, Ethereum could be expected to reach about 8% of Bitcoin's value, which would put ETH at around $13,200. However, breaking through the psychological barrier of $10,000 might be tough, meaning Ethereum would need a very strong market to go higher.

While $13,000 for Ethereum might seem unlikely, history shows that ETH has seen huge gains during bull markets, especially after Bitcoin halvings. In the last bull run, Ethereum reached nearly 9% of Bitcoin's value, and in earlier cycles, it hit as high as 15%. While those highs might not repeat, an 8% ETH-BTC ratio is definitely possible, especially given Ethereum's ongoing importance in DeFi and NFTs.

Of course, the biggest risk is the unpredictable nature of crypto markets. While many analysts are optimistic about both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potential challenges like regulatory changes, economic shifts, or unexpected technological developments could impact their performance. Anyone investing in ETH or BTC should be aware of these risks.

Investors can easily buy Bitcoin and Ether on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and eToro. They can also purchase these cryptocurrencies through a brokerage account with platforms like Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, TradeStation, or even through PayPal or Venmo.

Both Bitcoin and Ether have futures contracts available for trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. While futures trading can be complex, there are several Bitcoin and Ether ETFs that hold these futures contracts. Examples include the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH).

As of January 2024, Bitcoin investors can also buy spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold the actual cryptocurrency instead of futures contracts. The SEC has approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading on major U.S. exchanges, including:

For investment in Ethereum ETFs, here are some top funds:

Experts are generally optimistic about Bitcoin and Ethereum, although they recognize that these cryptocurrencies could experience price fluctuations due to changes in regulations, technological progress, and how widely they are adopted.

At Blockchain Reporter, we believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and Ethereum as investments. In its early days, Bitcoin was mainly used by a small group of tech enthusiasts. It was hard to get, had limited uses, and only a few merchants accepted it as payment. However, by 2023, Bitcoin has become much more mainstream. More businesses now accept Bitcoin as payment, and there are better tools, like user-friendly wallets and exchanges, making it easier for the average person to use.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin has also grown. Hedge funds, asset management firms, and endowments are starting to see Bitcoin as a valuable asset that can help diversify their portfolios and protect against inflation.

We are also bullish on decentralized software protocols, which offer an alternative to current intermediaries. Among these, Ethereum stands out as a likely leader in capturing significant economic value. We believe that by 2030, Ethereum could become a major force in digital assets, with its token potentially reaching a value of $11.8k.",https://blockchainreporter.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-ethereum6.webp,0.388235294117647

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,307.67, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Although ethereum is not the first altcoin, it's the most popular and successful. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Its blockchain has generated tremendous growth and returns over the past nine years.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $277.70 billion. It's up 42% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $277.70 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $77.12 billion, XRP at $57.10 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.84 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $277.70 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $308 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $294 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,307.67.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 42% year over year, compared to a 121% gain for bitcoin.

You might be more comfortable using online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Interactive Brokers, Webull, and Robinhood.

Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal have options for buying ETH. Cryptocurrency ATMs also allow for direct purchases.

How to store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1764705882352942

Leading Indonesian crypto exchange Indodax experienced a security breach, causing it to lose approximately $22 million. In response, the platform has disabled its mobile and web applications to investigate the incident and secure its systems.

T blockchain security firms PeckShield, Cyvers, and SlowMist raised alarms about suspicious activity involving Indodax's hot wallets. The hacker successfully drained large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC), Tron (TRX), Ether (ETH), and Polygon (MATIC), among other tokens.

Following the hack, SlowMist conducted an independent investigation and suggested that the breach may have originated from Indodax's withdrawal system. This vulnerability likely enabled the hacker to withdraw funds directly from the exchange's hot wallet.

According to SlowMist, the hacker stole substantial amounts from various blockchains. The stolen funds include over $1.42 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $2.4 million from Tron blockchain tokens, and over $14.6 million in ErC-20 tokens.

The criminal also stole $2.58 million in POL tokens from the Polygon network and approximately $0.9 million in Ethereum (ETH) from the Optimism blockchain.

However, Cyvers speculated that different systems were compromised, specifically pointing to the ""signature machine"" used in authorizing secure transactions.

Cyvers also flagged suspicious activity involving the exchange's wallets across multiple blockchain networks. It noted that the suspicious address already held $14.4 million and was in the process of converting the stolen tokens to Ethereum (ETH).

Once the hackers convert the stolen funds to ETH, they would likely use cryptocurrency mixing services like Tornado Cash to launder the assets anonymously.

Meanwhile, Peckshield reported on X that it detected significant cryptocurrency outflows from Indodax amounting to $15.7 million.

PeckShield further detailed that the funds were distributed across several blockchains. The criminals stored 5,204 ETH on an Ethereum address, 6.8 million POL on the Polygon network, and 380 ETH on the Optimism network.

In response, Indodax posted on X, acknowledging its security team had identified potential vulnerabilities on the platform. It has initiated full maintenance to ensure its system's integrity.

Due to the maintenance, Indodax temporarily shut down its website and app while assuring clients that their funds were 100% safe.

Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data shows that Indodax holds a reserve balance of approximately $369 million. This could potentially be used to compensate investors for losses incurred from the recent breach.

The head of AI at Cyvers, Yosi Hammer, has expressed suspicions that the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus may have attacked Indodax. In an interview with BSCN, Hammer noted that the hacker's tactics and methods were similar to those of the Lazarus group.

In a broader context, North Korea's Lazarus Group has been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency hacks in history. For example, in July, the Lazarus Group was also suspected of orchestrating a $235 million attack on the WazirX exchange. Cyvers and blockchain forensics firm Elliptic flagged the attack.",https://techreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/burglar-2615320_1280.png,0.05098039215686279
"LATAM Crypto Roundup: Argentina Protects Scam Victims, Bancolombia's Wenia Integrates Solana, and More",https://beincrypto.com/beincrypto-com-latam-crypto-news-september-15/,2024-09-15,BeInCrypto,"As the Latin American crypto scene grows, these stories highlight the region's rising influence in the global market.

BeInCrypto comprehensive Latam Crypto Roundup brings Latin America's most important news and trends. With reporters in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and more, we cover the latest updates and insights from the region's crypto scene.

This week's roundup highlights Argentina's efforts to protect cryptocurrency scam victims, Bancolombia's integration of the Solana and Arbitrum networks, along with other key stories.

Bancolombia's crypto platform, Wenia, has expanded its offerings by integrating the Solana and Arbitrum networks, allowing users to transfer Ethereum (ETH) via Arbitrum. This update aims to enhance user experience with lower transaction fees and faster processing times.

The inclusion of Solana and Arbitrum positions Wenia as a competitive force in the region, particularly with Arbitrum's scalability advantages over Ethereum. Wenia noted that this move aligns the platform with a global trend favoring more efficient blockchain networks.

""We have an invitation you're going to love! Arbitrum and Solana networks are now available on Wenia App, and our crypto specialist Rafael Santamaría will tell you everything in a takeover this Friday, September 13, on our Telegram channel. Don't miss it!"" the platform announced via its X account.

This expansion comes amid a surge in cryptocurrency activity in Latam, with Bitcoin (BTC) representing 53% of crypto wallets in the region, and Colombia accounting for 19% of all BTC purchases, according to Bitso. Earlier this year, Wenia introduced Chainlink's Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) services to enhance transparency in its holdings.

""On-chain Proof of Reserve data is a critical component for digital asset adoption and serves as a springboard toward increasing consumer confidence in the use of stablecoins and other tokenized assets. We chose Chainlink for its industry-leading platform,"" said Pablo Arboleda, CEO of Wenia.

Since its launch, Wenia has offered a variety of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, MATIC, and the COPW stablecoin. The platform also allows users to view detailed reports on the reserves backing the COPW stablecoin through its Reserve Test feature.

Enegix Global has announced plans to use isolated natural gas as the energy source for its upcoming cryptocurrency mining data center in Brazil. Set to launch this November, the facility will initially have a 25-megawatt (MW) capacity, with plans to expand to 80 MW.

The isolated natural gas, found in areas with limited infrastructure, offers a cleaner energy alternative for mining operations, particularly in regions rich in gas reserves. This move aligns with Brazil's growing reputation for both cryptocurrency adoption and renewable energy innovation.

""In addition to being considered one of the largest cryptocurrency adoption markets in the world, Brazil has ideal conditions to attract the digital mining industry as well. With clean energy sources, such as isolated natural gas and hydroelectric power plants, the country favors the promotion of sustainability in the sector and at the same time presents favorable conditions for operating costs and electricity generation,"" Enegix CEO Yerbolsyn Sarsenov stated.

The project aims to support the mining of Bitcoin and altcoins while enhancing Enegix's power management capabilities by over 30%.

According to the latest report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Argentina are among the top 20 countries globally with the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates. These Latin American nations join others like India, Nigeria, and the United States in leading the world in crypto usage and transfers.

Chainalysis' global adoption index highlights the role of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in driving BTC activity in North America and Western Europe. In contrast, stablecoins have had a more significant impact in regions such as Africa and Latin America.

""Between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, the total value of global crypto activity increased substantially, reaching higher levels than 2021 during the cryptocurrency bull market. This year, cryptocurrency activity increased in countries at all income levels, with a pullback in high-income countries from early 2024,"" the report noted.

In Latin America, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Argentina are leading the charge. The report also notes a significant increase in global cryptocurrency activity between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, surpassing the levels seen during the 2021 bull market. Cryptocurrency usage grew across all income levels, although high-income countries saw a slight decline in early 2024.

Fundación Blockchain Argentina has launched a new initiative aimed at protecting cryptocurrency users by offering free legal advice to victims of scams. Led by Dr. Sabrina Scavone, the program aims to provide guidance to individuals who have fallen prey to cryptocurrency-related fraud. As investments in digital assets, such as Bitcoin, continue to rise, so too have incidents of scams, creating concern within the crypto community.

The service focuses on offering specialized legal advice to those who have suffered financial losses from Ponzi schemes, fraudulent investments, or phishing attacks. The Foundation's move follows a significant increase in such crimes, with reports indicating millions of dollars lost to hacks and scams. The service will provide victims with a thorough analysis of their legal options and clear steps for pursuing their cases.

Guido Zatloukal, president of Fundación Blockchain Argentina, highlighted that this initiative reflects the organization's commitment to the safety and well-being of the country's crypto community.

Sabrina Scavone also stressed the importance of creating a more secure and transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem, noting that legal tools can be crucial for those affected by such crimes. With the rise of fraud, Fundación Blockchain Argentina strengthens its role in promoting blockchain education and development, now extending its efforts to include legal support.

On September 6, 2024, Venezuelan authorities, led by the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) and the Public Prosecutor's Office, seized 35 Bitcoin mining machines in the state of Guárico. The operation, sanctioned by the 3rd Control Court of San Juan de los Morros, also resulted in the confiscation of 30 extractors, several industrial fans, and two vehicles. The raid occurred due to the lack of necessary permits for operating the mining farm.

In Venezuela, cryptocurrency mining is heavily regulated, requiring authorization from the National Superintendence of Cryptoassets (Sunacrip). However, since Sunacrip was suspended in 2023 amid a corruption scandal involving state oil company PDVSA, the crypto industry has been left without a clear regulatory framework.

This regulatory void has created challenges for miners. Many argue that they lack the guidance to operate legally, resulting in interventions like the one in Guárico. High energy consumption from Bitcoin mining, particularly from ASIC machines, has been a key issue, exacerbating Venezuela's ongoing energy crisis. Frequent blackouts have prompted the government to disconnect mining farms from the National Electric System (SEN), aiming to stabilize power for citizens.

President Nicolás Maduro recently stated that cryptocurrencies would become a priority on his political agenda, but details on restoring Sunacrip or clarifying regulations remain vague. Until then, the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin mining in Venezuela continues, with miners left exposed to legal action and sanctions. Similar crackdowns have been reported in Paraguay, where protecting the electricity grid is also cited as the primary reason for such interventions.

As the Latam crypto scene grows, these stories highlight the region's increasing influence in the global market. Stay tuned for more updates and insights in next week's roundup.",https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BIC_Latin_America-covers.png,0.1843137254901961

Crypto ETFs are safer than owning cryptocurrencies outright - but you're still in unknown territory,https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240914266/crypto-etfs-are-safer-than-owning-cryptocurrencies-outright-but-youre-still-in-unknown-territory,2024-09-14,Morningstar,"How to buy bitcoin, ether and other crypto ETFs with more security and less risk

With the rise of cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds, many investors believe they've found a safer way to dip into the volatile world of bitcoin (BTCUSD), ether (ETHUSD) and other digital assets. While crypto ETFs offer a layer of protection direct crypto investment lacks, they're not without their own set of risks. Here's what you need to know to protect your crypto holdings:

1. Keep it real: Investing in crypto through ETFs is generally safer than holding cryptocurrencies directly. You're not dealing with digital wallets, private keys or the risk of crypto-exchange hacks. Yet this apparent safety net can lull investors into a false sense of security. Remember, the underlying assets are still highly volatile, and this volatility will be reflected in the ETF's value.

During the bitcoin price crash of 2022, for example, when the popular crypto's value plunged more than 60% from its all-time high, ETFs tracking bitcoin's price saw similar declines. While ETFs protect you from some crypto-specific risks, they don't insulate you from market volatility.

2. Understand what you're buying: When you buy a crypto ETF, you're not getting a standard financial product. You're investing in a fund that holds or tracks cryptocurrencies or blockchain-related companies. You need to know how crypto trading operates. For instance, if your ETF is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, a sudden regulatory crackdown on bitcoin mining could significantly impact your investment. Similarly, a major security flaw discovered in Ethereum could tank the value of ETFs with large ether holdings.

Some crypto ETFs include stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology - ranging from crypto exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN) and mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), to Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants investing in blockchain. Publicly traded companies come with their own risks and potential rewards.

Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto ETFs face unique challenges when it comes to asset custody. The companies holding the actual cryptocurrencies for the ETF (known as custodians) are a potential point of failure. If a custodian's security is breached, it could lead to significant losses for the ETF and, by extension, your investment.

3. Custody matters: Always research the custodial arrangements of any crypto ETF you're considering. Look for ETFs that use reputable custodians with a track record of strong security measures, including cold storage for assets and comprehensive insurance policies.

Here's what to ask about an ETF's custodian:

What security measures are in place? Have they ever experienced a security breach? If so, how was it handled?Are multisignature wallets in use? What portion of assets is held in cold storage versus hot wallets? What insurance policies do they have, and what exactly do these policies cover?

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still in development, and this uncertainty extends to crypto ETFs. A sudden regulatory change could force an ETF to quickly sell off assets, potentially at unfavorable prices. In extreme cases, regulatory shifts could even lead to the delisting of an ETF.

Stay informed about the regulatory environment in the countries where your ETF operates. Be prepared for the possibility that rules could change rapidly, affecting your investment.

Consider these scenarios:

A country bans cryptocurrency mining, affecting the profitability of mining companies in your ETF's portfolio.New tax regulations are introduced, impacting the ETF's returns or reporting requirements.Stricter know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules are implemented, potentially limiting the ETF's ability to trade certain assets.

4. Liquidity trap: Crypto ETFs can face liquidity issues, especially during times of market stress. If a large number of investors try to sell their ETF shares simultaneously, the fund might struggle to sell its crypto holdings fast enough to meet redemption demands. This could lead to the ETF trading at a significant discount to its net asset value. Before investing, check the liquidity of the ETF and its underlying assets. Larger, more established funds tend to have better liquidity.

Here are some factors that can affect an ETF's liquidity:

Trading volume: Higher daily trading volumes generally indicate better liquidity.Assets under management: Larger funds usually have better liquidity.Spread: A narrow bid-ask spread often indicates good liquidity.Creation/redemption process: Understand how the ETF creates and redeems shares, as this can impact liquidity.

5. New scams: While crypto ETFs protect you from many traditional cryptocurrency scams, they've given rise to a new breed of fraudulent activities. Watch out for:

Fake ETFs: Scammers create fraudulent ETFs that mimic legitimate ones. Always verify an ETF's legitimacy through official channels like the SEC's EDGAR database.

Sophisticated phishing: Instead of trying to steal your crypto wallet keys, scammers might impersonate your broker or the ETF company to gain access to your investment account. These attacks can be highly targeted. For example, a scammer might use information from your social-media profiles to craft a convincing impersonation of your financial adviser, then try to persuade you to transfer funds or share account details.

Deepfake dangers: Some scammers use deepfake technology to impersonate financial advisers or ETF executives. Always verify the identity of anyone asking you to make investment decisions, especially if they're pressuring you to act quickly.

Pump-and-dump schemes: While not exclusive to ETFs, pump-and-dump schemes can target smaller or newer crypto ETFs. Scammers might spread false information to inflate the price of an ETF or its underlying assets, then sell their holdings once the price has risen.

Front-running: This is when someone with advance knowledge of a large pending transaction uses that information for their own profit. In the context of ETFs, an unethical insider might use knowledge of the ETF's rebalancing schedule to trade the underlying assets beforehand.

Tracking error

Crypto ETFs, especially those using futures contracts rather than holding cryptocurrencies directly, can suffer from tracking error. This means the ETF's performance may not perfectly mirror the performance of the underlying assets it's meant to track.

Factors contributing to tracking error include:

Management fees Transaction costsDifferences between spot and futures prices (for futures-based ETFs)Rebalancing frequency

Protecting your portfolio

How can you safeguard your investments? Here are some key steps:

1. Do your homework: Thoroughly research any ETF before investing. Understand its holdings, management team and track record. Look into the fund's prospectus, which will detail its investment strategy, risks and fees. Pay attention to the expense ratio; while crypto ETFs tend to have higher fees than traditional ETFs, excessive fees can eat into your returns.

2. Secure your brokerage account: Use strong, unique passwords and hardware-based two-factor authentication. Be wary of using public wifi for accessing your investment accounts.

3. Stay informed: Keep up with news about the cryptocurrencies your ETF holds and any regulatory developments. Follow reputable financial news sources and consider setting up alerts for news related to your investments.

4. Diversify: Don't concentrate your portfolio. Crypto ETFs should be part of a diversified portfolio, not your main investment strategy. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when deciding what portion of your portfolio to allocate to crypto ETFs.

5. Be skeptical: If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be especially wary of unsolicited investment advice or pressure to act quickly. Take the time to verify information independently before making any investment decisions.

6. Understand the tax implications: Crypto ETF investments can have complex tax implications. Consult with a tax professional to understand how your investments might affect your tax situation.

7. Use reputable brokers: Only invest through well-known, regulated brokers. Check their credentials and read reviews from other users.

8. Monitor investments regularly: Keep an eye on your ETF's performance and any changes in its underlying assets or management strategy. However, avoid the temptation to make knee-jerk reactions to short-term market movements.

By understanding these unique challenges and taking proactive steps, you can navigate the crypto ETF landscape safely and confidently. Remember, in the world of investing, knowledge isn't just power - it's protection.

Most Downloaded Crypto Wallets in 2024 | Bitcoinist.com,https://bitcoinist.com/most-downloaded-crypto-wallets-in-2024/,2024-09-13,Bitcoinist.com,"The global cryptocurrency wallet market was valued at $10.28 billion in 2023, and it is expected to surpass $94.45 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.83% from 2024 to 2033. Currently, cryptocurrency wallets account for nearly 25% of sales in the overall cryptocurrency market. According to Statista, in March 2024 alone, downloads of the largest cryptocurrency storage apps worldwide exceeded 23 million.

One of the key advantages of cryptocurrency wallets is their capacity to securely store users' private keys or passwords, making their cryptocurrencies safe and accessible. This allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Crypto wallets are often the first point of contact with blockchain for most novice users as they begin exploring the world of cryptocurrency, making the quality of these wallets a crucial factor in determining whether a user continues their crypto journey. This article will review the latest and most popular crypto wallets on the market and explain why they deserve their place in our rankings.

Bitget Wallet has recently reported reaching 12 million monthly active users -- a record metric in the market. It is now the top Web3 wallet by app downloads, surpassing MetaMask and hitting the milestone of 30 million users, making it the largest Web3 wallet on the market.

The key to its popularity lies in its multifunctionality and advanced user experience. Bitget Wallet was the first to achieve multi-chain aggregation, allowing users to interact with decentralized apps across various blockchains -- all within a single app. This gives Bitget Wallet an edge over MetaMask, which has traditionally focused on the Ethereum ecosystem.

Additionally, Bitget Wallet offers on-chain token charts and cross-chain transactions and integrates NFT markets and launchpads on multiple chains. It has integrated with over 100 major public and EVM-compatible blockchain networks, making it the best all-in-one entry point for crypto users.

Bitget Wallet's security is backed by cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, a leader in spot and derivatives trading. It boasts a unique DESM encryption algorithm and a $300 million User Protection Fund, providing a strong security track record.

Being the longest-tenured and most well-known crypto wallet in the market, MetaMask is probably an app that started it all for many crypto enthusiasts years ago.

MetaMask's feature set has significantly expanded over the years. Originally designed for Ethereum tokens, it now includes an NFT gallery, a token bridge, Ethereum staking capabilities, and the MetaMask Portfolio, a suite of tools that offers experienced users more control over their digital assets.

In August, MetaMask launched the world's first crypto payment card in partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. This launch will likely have a significant impact on the industry as a whole as it will contribute to the global mass adoption of crypto into everyday casual use.

However, its market-leading status comes with both advantages and challenges. As the most popular software wallet, MetaMask has become a target for hackers and has sparked debates about its decentralization, with some users concerned about the level of authority it holds in the Web3 space.

Tangem stands out in the 2024 crypto wallet landscape with its blend of security, simplicity, and versatility. Available in two forms -- a plastic card and a zirconia ceramic ring -- Tangem emphasizes top-tier protection with its EAL6+ certified hardware, safeguarding against both invasive and non-invasive attacks.

The wallet's firmware has undergone independent audits by Kudelski Security and Riscure, ensuring the absence of backdoors and maintaining firmware integrity with no updates allowed post-installation. Tangem supports over 6,000 cryptocurrencies across 65+ blockchain networks, providing users with robust management capabilities including buying, selling, and swapping assets. Its IP68-rated durability ensures resistance to dust, water, EMP, ESD, and X-rays, while NFC connectivity simplifies asset management through the Tangem mobile app without needing additional power sources.

Additionally, Tangem Express offers secure, competitive token swaps. This combination of advanced security features, extensive cryptocurrency support, and durable design makes Tangem a compelling choice for crypto enthusiasts.

Coin Wallet was founded by CoinSpace LLC in 2015, starting with both mobile and browser versions. Initially focused solely on Bitcoin, the wallet evolved over the years, reflecting the growing diversity of the cryptocurrency landscape. By 2021, Coin Wallet launched its desktop application, expanding its user base by offering more flexibility across devices.

In response to market demand, the wallet's supported assets grew steadily. By 2021, Binance Smart Chain tokens and Dogecoin were integrated, with further additions in 2022, including Cardano, Ethereum Classic, Solana, and Tron. A significant milestone came later that year when Coin Wallet became one of the first platforms to support the Monero hard fork, solidifying its position as a forward-thinking and adaptable platform.

By 2024, Coin Wallet had introduced support for Toncoin, Fantom, Optimism, and their respective tokens, bringing the total to 21 supported currencies, not counting the hundreds of tokens available. Today, Coin Wallet is used by over 24 million wallets across 190 countries, making it the most popular and secure non-custodial multicurrency wallet.

Not only does this wallet have the most desirable name and URL on the market, but it has deservingly earned its spot as one of the safest and most secure wallets in the sector.

Crypto.com has a stellar reputation with regulation compliance, and though it did face an exploit back in 2022, since then the wallet has incorporated top-notch encryption technology, and biometric and multi-factor authentication to protect its users.

What sets it apart is its seamless integration with the entire Crypto.com ecosystem, allowing users to trade, earn, and even spend crypto with the Crypto.com Visa card.

In August, Crypto.com announced that its US users can now purchase cryptocurrencies with PayPal, allowing people to seamlessly buy crypto in a much faster and more convenient manner. This feature is set to attract many new US-based users to the wallet given that PayPal is a well-established and trusted payment option with a good history in the region.",https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17437.jpeg,0.2705882352941176
Best Ethereum ETFs: Top funds for buying Ethereum,https://www.kansas.com/living/personal-finance/article292421484.html,2024-09-13,The Wichita Eagle,"Traders who want to buy and sell the cryptocurrency Ethereum can now use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to do so. The best Ethereum ETFs make it easy to trade the second-most-popular cryptocurrency through a traditional broker rather than more complex cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024, following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. Ethereum ETFs began trading in July, and by using an Ethereum ETF, traders can purchase the cryptocurrency without taking custody of the coin or working with cryptocurrency exchanges with sometimes dubious security.

Here are some of the best Ethereum ETFs, including their performance and annual fees.

Top Ethereum ETFs

Source: ETF.com. Data as of Sept. 11, 2024.

*On Jan. 1, 2026, this fund will start charging 0.25 percent annually.

**On Feb. 1, 2025, this fund will start charging 0.19 percent annually.

These spot EThereum ETFs track the price of the cryptocurrency on the same percentage basis, if they trade at different fund prices. If Ethereum rises 2 percent, these funds should rise a similar amount. So these ETFs have all performed comparably since approval.

So which is the best fund for you? Since their performance is largely the same and they own the same underlying asset, the best ETF is one that offers you the lowest expense ratio. It's a similar situation with index funds that track major indexes such as the S&P 500. If the funds track the same index, then your best pick is the fund that charges the lower costs.

Much like when new Bitcoin funds were offered, a few of these new Ethereum funds are offering no expense ratio for a limited period. A few fund managers may be trying to build up assets and investors quickly, but those fees will eventually revert after an initial period of low fees expires.

The ETFs' fees are more than competitive with trading Ethereum directly at most brokerages and crypto exchanges, meaning it's easier and cheaper to buy your cryptocurrency through a fund. You'll be able to trade with an existing broker without the hassle of a new crypto account.

Should you invest in Ethereum ETFs?

The advent of Ethereum ETFs doesn't mean that the popular cryptocurrency is a buy, of course, just that it's now easier and cheaper to do so. But the funds do offer a good way for traders to wager on the digital currency if they were already planning to do that, while avoiding some of the security headache of safeguarding and securing cryptocurrency.

Those thinking of investing in Ethereum should consider what SEC chief Gary Gensler said in January when his agency approved Bitcoin ETFs. He warned: ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.""

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has been tremendously volatile since it debuted, making it an attractive trading vehicle for skilled traders. It's even done well for those who have bought and held a stake. But volatility can be rough on inexperienced traders, leading them to buy high and sell low, as the volatility scares them and then saps their resolve to continue holding when the coin hits a low.

Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not backed by the hard assets or cash flow of an underlying entity. The only thing that supports its price is the sentiment of traders, who believe they can sell it to another trader for more money later. This type of strategy is what investing experts call the ""greater fool theory of investing,"" as traders only make money selling an asset to someone else who is more optimistic about its prospects and price potential than they are.

For this reason and others, legendary investor Warren Buffett has stayed clear of cryptocurrency, and has warned about others such as Bitcoin, which he called ""probably rat poison squared.""

Where can you buy the best Ethereum ETFs?

Ethereum ETFs are typically available at any broker that allows customers to buy stocks or funds on a major U.S. exchange. The best brokers for stock trading let investors buy any available ETF with no commission, so you can trade in and out of a position at a low cost.

Bottom line

The ability to trade spot Ethereum ETFs makes it easy and cheap for traders to take a stake in the digital currency at their usual broker without needing a specialized account at a crypto exchange. These funds may make Ethereum a more attractive option for traders, perhaps leading to greater liquidity and acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fcgqcu/picture292421039/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/36b4c38a-6fc0-438d-a5ce-447253ac414a,0.3176470588235294

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,354.33, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Although ethereum is not the first altcoin, it's the most popular and successful. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Its blockchain has generated tremendous growth and returns over the past nine years.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $283.55 billion. It's up 45% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 70% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $77.55 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $307 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $292 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,354.33.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 45% year over year, compared to a 119% gain for bitcoin.

How to buy ethereum

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to safely store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1764705882352942
Innovating Finance: Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Insights | Technology Org,https://moguldom.com/459157/the-evolution-and-impact-of-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology/,2024-09-13,Moguldom,"Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary digital currency secured through cryptography, operating independently of central authorities. Enabled by blockchain technology, a decentralized ledger system, guarantees transparent, secure, and immutable transactions. This system records transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency and preventing you from fraud or manipulation.

Historical Background (Origins of Bitcoin)

Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by the mysterious figure Satoshi Nakamoto, marked the start of cryptocurrencies. Designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin aimed to provide an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply captivated early adopters, laying the groundwork for a new era of digital finance.

Bitcoin's early adoption included instances like the purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC by Laszlo Hanyecz on May 22, 2010, now valued at millions of dollars, illustrating both its early adoption and the substantial appreciation in value over time and is now celebrated annually by the cryptocurrency community as ""Bitcoin Pizza Day.""

Importance and Relevance in Today's Digital Economy

In today's digital economy, cryptocurrencies offer several advantages over traditional banking systems. They facilitate decentralized transactions, promoting financial inclusion and reducing dependence on intermediaries. Elon Musk's endorsement and involvement in cryptocurrency markets, particularly with Tesla's acceptance of Bitcoin for vehicle purchases (though later withdrawn due to environmental issues), highlighted its growing mainstream appeal and volatility.

Understanding Blockchain Technology

Blockchain serves as the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, revolutionizing the way transactions are verified and stored. It operates as a distributed ledger where data is grouped into blocks, each linked cryptographically to the previous one, forming a chain.

Definition and Fundamental Principles

Blockchain ensures transactional integrity through decentralization, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms. Decentralization means transactions are verified by a network of nodes rather than a central authority, ensuring transparency and resilience against fraud. Cryptography secures data through encryption techniques, while consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) validate transactions and maintain the blockchain's integrity.

Types of Blockchains

Key Components of Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency relies on cryptographic principles and secure wallet management for transactions. Public and private keys authenticate transactions, with public keys serving as addresses for receiving funds and private keys ensuring secure access. Hash functions maintain blockchain integrity by uniquely identifying each block. CryptoWallets like Ledger Nano and software options such as MetaMask manage these keys, enabling secure storage and transaction capabilities. Cryptocurrency addresses derived from public keys facilitate safe fund transfers, each address generated through cryptographic processes to ensure security and uniqueness.

Major Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin and Ethereum stand as crucial cryptocurrencies in the digital realm that have significantly shaped the digital economy and technological landscape.

Bitcoin, introduced as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, marked a breakthrough in financial innovation. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins and status as digital cash has made it a deflationary asset, subject to dramatic market fluctuations influenced in part by Elon Musk's public statements. Despite regulatory hurdles and environmental concerns regarding its energy-intensive mining, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum, building on Bitcoin's foundations, introduced smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), revolutionizing digital transactions. Smart contracts automate agreements, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications for lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Ethereum 2.0 addresses scalability through a transition to the energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and innovations like sharding, aiming to enhance transaction speed and accommodate increased demand for decentralized applications.

Applications of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency

Blockchain technology expands beyond cryptocurrency, offering transparency, efficiency, and security across various sectors. In supply chain management, blockchain ensures traceability and authenticity, reducing fraud and enhancing ethical sourcing practices.

In financial services, blockchain powers decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Smart contracts automate lending, borrowing, and trading, granting users greater control over their assets. Stablecoins, like Tether and USD Coin, mitigate cryptocurrency volatility, providing stable transaction mediums and hedging tools. These applications highlight blockchain's ability to revolutionize financial systems and ensure stability in digital economies.

Challenges and Concerns

Despite its potential benefits, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies face several challenges that hinder widespread adoption and integration into mainstream industries.

Blockchain scalability remains a significant challenge, limiting transaction throughput and speed across networks. High transaction fees and network congestion during peak periods pose usability challenges for users and developers alike.

Blockchain's security vulnerabilities, including 51% attacks and double-spending, pose risks to network integrity and user trust. Regulatory uncertainties and varying legal frameworks globally impact cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain applications, hindering market growth and innovation.

How to Buy Tron (TRX) * A Step-by-Step Guide * Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-tron-coin,2024-09-12,Benzinga,"Our team is diligently working to keep up with trends in the crypto markets. Keep up to date on the latest news and up-and-coming coins.

Tron is a decentralized blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate the creation and sharing of digital content using peer-to-peer technology. Its native token, Tron's Tronix (TRX) is listed on more than 130 exchanges and has the distinction of offering its own world-class wallet. The TRX cryptocurrency also acts as the basic unit of account for the Tron blockchain.

Tron has garnered attention for its ambitious vision of disrupting the entertainment industry and enabling a more open and decentralized internet. This allows users to directly interact with content and creators while retaining control over their data. If you want to know how to buy Tron (TRX) and add it to your crypto portfolio, use our step-by-step guide to get started today.

Follow these simple and easy steps to purchase Tron and begin your TRX crypto investment.

Before you can buy cryptocurrencies, you'll need to open an online account with a crypto broker or cryptocurrency exchange. Most platforms require an email address and password for account creation. You must also submit identification to verify your account. This is necessary for compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

Once your account is verified, you can transfer funds and make deposits using multiple payment methods. Many platforms accept credit card and debit card, wire transfer, and cryptocurrency deposit from external crypto exchanges and wallets.

To deposit, select your preferred payment method. Then, follow the platform's instructions. Enter the desired deposit amount and review any transaction fees before confirming the transaction.

Once you've opened and funded an account, you can now make your first TRX purchase. Navigate to the trade section and select TRON or TRX. Enter the amount of cryptocurrency you wish to purchase and place the buy order. Make sure to review the details before confirming the transaction. After purchasing, your TRX coins will appear on the hosted wallet on the platform, which you can then transfer to your chosen cryptocurrency wallet.

Founded in 2017 by Justin Sun and the non-profit Tron Foundation, Tron is a decentralized blockchain platform specializing in entertainment and content sharing. The Singapore-based company has one of the world's fastest growing public blockchains that uses peer-to-peer (P2P) technology boasting over 8.4 billion transactions and 257 million accounts.

Tron has even been likened to a next generation social media outlet since the Tron crypto ecosystem lets you create and share content with anyone, anywhere. Unlike social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, the Tron cryptocurrency ecosystem compensates you for the data and content you create.

In addition, Tron's decentralized distributed storage technology gives you the freedom of creating and uploading content directly into the Tron network without the concern of being censored by big tech companies like Google, Spotify or YouTube.

The platform utilizes smart contracts and has its own token, TRX, which is used to facilitate transactions and incentivize participation within the network. It uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to improve transaction speed and reduce fees compared to Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin. While PoW relies on miners to solve complex problems for transaction validation, DPoS allows token holders to vote for a limited number of validators, making transaction processing faster and more efficient. DPoS builds on the earlier Proof of Stake (PoS) method, where validators are selected based on their token stake, reducing the energy and computational power needed for blockchain validation.

TRON (TRX) has experienced a volatile price history since its launch in September 2017. Initially, it saw rapid appreciation, reaching an all-time high of around $0.3004 in Jan. 5, 2018, fueled by speculative interest during the cryptocurrency boom. However, like many cryptocurrencies, TRX faced volatility, leading to declines in subsequent years. With the resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies in 2020-2021, TRX again faced fluctuations, peaking at about $0.16 in April 2021. Following this peak, TRX's price has continued to experience ups and downs, reflecting broader market trends and developments in the TRON ecosystem, with its community and use cases evolving over time.

As of writing, TRX's price remains subject to market volatility, but it continues to maintain a significant presence in the cryptocurrency space. The token is currently trading for around $0.1519, with market capitalization of $13.17 billion. This places Tron in the top 10 leading cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap.

Here are some platforms to help you get started on your TRX crypto investment.

There are many different kinds of crypto wallets that support the Tron network. Although some exchanges and brokers allow you to store your coins in their wallet, your investment may not be as secure as holding your coins in your own digital wallet.

A cryptocurrency wallet provides enhanced control and security for storing your tokens. There are two primary types of crypto wallets: software wallets and hardware wallets. A software wallet requires an internet connection to access your tokens. In contrast, a hardware wallet stores your tokens offline on a physical device.

The Ledger ecosystem is a clean and beginner-friendly way to access your Tron wallet. It is a widely used hardware wallet known for its excellent cold-storage security. It supports various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ledger offers Bluetooth compatibility for accessing decentralized applications through the Ledger Live app on smartphones.

Exodus Wallet is a user-friendly software wallet that allows users to store, manage and exchange various cryptocurrencies. It caters to beginners with features like a built-in exchange, portfolio tracking and support for over 100 cryptocurrencies. By storing private keys locally for enhanced security, Exodus offers a seamless experience for both mobile and desktop users, appealing to novice and experienced crypto enthusiasts alike.

Once you have gone ahead and purchased your TRX cryptocurrency, you will have established a long position in it that will appreciate in value if the digital currency's price rises. Next you need to watch the market and decide whether to hold or sell your TRX cryptocurrency as its value shifts. Your trading or investment style, your risk tolerance and your overall plan will generally determine when to sell the cryptocurrency you purchased.

With TRX trading around $0.15, you may just want to purchase a block of this inexpensive cryptocurrency as an investment to put into a wallet where you can forget about it for a few years. This strategy has worked out well for many cryptocurrency investors, most notably those who purchased Bitcoin in its infancy.

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, with significant daily price fluctuations, particularly in smaller altcoins. It is essential to monitor market movements each morning before investing.

As one of the prominent cryptocurrencies, Tron has made headlines for its ambitions in the decentralized content sharing space and its partnership with various platforms. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it is subject to high volatility and market speculation.

The digital currency market is still growing, so investing in TRX sooner rather than later would probably be a prudent move if you think long term appreciation seems likely. Tron's platform and ecosystem also show considerable promise as the next step in social media, and its native TRX digital coin looks like a viable and inexpensive cryptocurrency.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/11162327/tron.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.192156862745098
How to Buy Quant (QNT) Guide * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-quant-qnt,2024-09-12,Benzinga,"Large corporations, banks and governments are utilizing distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to enhance their cloud-based services. Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum are among the most popular options, but the market is still fractured between more than 10 major DLT providers.

Before the introduction of Quant Network's Overledger, there were challenges in enabling applications to interact with multiple DLTs. The Quant token's value surged to eight times its initial worth in early 2021 but fell during the 2022 cryptocurrency market crash. Despite not reaching previous highs, it remained a trading price between $60 and $100 in 2024.

With so many cryptocurrencies on the market, it can be hard to know what's legit and what's a cash grab. Learn more about what Quant is and how you can start investing today.

Ready to get started investing in Quant? Here's a step by step guide on how to buy Quant today!

Quant is supported by several cryptocurrency trading platforms, including Coinbase and Uphold. Visit the website or download the mobile app of your chosen exchange. Navigate to the Sign Up or Register option. You'll need to provide an email address and password for account creation. In the United States, regulations force cryptocurrency exchanges to verify user identities before they can trade. This usually entails providing your address, Social Security number and a picture of your driver's license (or other valid ID). Once you set up your exchange account and enter in the required verification information, you will be ready to start trading crypto.

Now that your account is ready for trading, you'll need to deposit fiat currency or another supported cryptocurrency to fund your account. Many platforms accept various payment methods. These include credit and debit cards, wire transfers, and cryptocurrency deposits from external exchanges and crypto wallets.

Choose your preferred payment method and follow the platform's instructions. Enter the amount you wish to deposit and review any applicable transaction fees before confirming the transaction.

Now that your account is funded, you are ready to place a buy order. Navigate to the trade section of your chosen platform and search for Quant or QNT. Click the option to buy and enter your desired amount. Review the details before executing the order. Once confirmed, your QNT will be credited to your portfolio and you will receive a confirmation email.

If you deposit a different crypto, you will have to sell it for U.S. dollars (USD) before you can purchase Quant. Once you have your USD ready in your exchange account, look for the QNT/USD pair and make your purchase.

Quant is the payment and validator token of the Overledger operating system, Quant Network's flagship product. It is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that is used to pay for Quant's services and validate, sign and encrypt transactions sent on Overledger. Quant Network's ultimate goal is to provide seamless interoperability to the fractured world of distributed ledger technologies.

DLTs are databases spread among multiple physical locations and network participants. They remove the need for a central intermediary to process and validate transactions on it. It's important to understand that DLTs and blockchains are not the same. In fact, blockchains are just a subset of distributed ledgers. Blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are decentralized ledgers in which each new transaction is verified via cryptographic signatures (known as hash functions) that build off of previous transactions.

Quant Network's Overledger aims to be both regulator and developer-friendly. The company already works with multiple government agencies to improve their cloud frameworks including the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) of the United Kingdom. Developers can build simple applications on Overledger that can interact with multiple DLTs and other applications on the same DLT. They must pay for Quant Network's platform and annual license fees with the Quant token, possibly driving its price up whenever more applications are built on Overledger.

Quant Network Ltd was founded by Gilbert Verdian in 2015, years before its flagship product Overledger and the Quant token were launched. Verdian saw an enormous problem that needed solving when he was working at Her Majesty's Treasury and later in the Department of Health in Australia. He saw how impactful DLTs would be in the future and sought to fix the largest issues in modern global information exchange. He also understood that no one DLT would take over the market, and thus improvements in interoperability would be vital. So far he has been right, and Quant Network has performed incredibly well this year.

The 1.5 update to the Overledger OS in January 2021 opened Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple ledgers to its applications. Quant's price almost immediately exploded to over $40 from about $11 earlier that month. The price continued to rise after further updates this June giving apps even more functionality. It skyrocketed to above $400 at its all-time high in September. At the time of writing, the token is hovering around $75. It has a market capitalization of around $915, ranking QNT as the 69th largest crypto in terms of market cap. The company plans on releasing further updates to add access to more DLTs and to further expand app functionality and ease of use.

Check out some of the best crypto exchanges that support Quant token below. Coinbase is a great option for new investors, and they have a Coinbase Learn program that will deposit free crypto to your account for learning about the technology.

There are two options for storing QNT: hardware wallets, which are physical devices that keep cryptocurrency private keys offline, and software wallets, which are digital applications that store private keys online or on devices like smartphones or computers.

Ledger is a leading cryptocurrency wallet brand. The Nano S is Ledger's basic model with all the security and simplicity a hardware wallet needs. The Nano X model adds Bluetooth functionality and a larger screen for about twice the price of the basic model. Both Ledgers support most major cryptos including Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and all ERC-20 tokens (including Quant).

Coinbase Wallet is a secure software wallet available as a browser extension and mobile app. It features crypto trading, storage for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, while supporting major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and LTC.

Altcoins like Quant can be extremely volatile and you should know how to sell or convert your tokens. It's incredibly easy to close your Quant position. You can either sell your Quant on the exchange you purchased it from or you can use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap it for another token. If you want to sell it for USD just send it back to your exchange account, find the QNT/USD pair and sell. You could also go to Uniswap, a (DEX) on Ethereum, and use a software wallet to swap it for another cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Daily price fluctuations are typical, especially with smaller cryptocurrencies. Real-time data is essential for investors in a dynamic market. Here's a quick look at how some of the top coins are performing today.

Quant has been a fantastic investment for anyone that bought and held before Overledger 1.5 was released. However, those who purchased the token at its peak may be down more than 80% on their investment. This is the reality for altcoins in general, not just Quant. They are volatile and risky investments that may see massive returns or destructive losses.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/08110237/quant.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.04313725490196085
What is Bitcoin And How Does It Work,https://techbullion.com/what-is-bitcoin-and-how-bitcoin-works/,2024-09-12,TechBullion,"Bitcoin has become a household name, often considered the gold standard of digital currency. But despite its popularity, many people are still unclear about what Bitcoin really is and how it works. In this article, we will explore what Bitcoin is, how it operates, how Bitcoin mining works, how you can buy and store Bitcoin, and its practical uses. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to deepen your understanding of Bitcoin, this guide is designed to provide clear insights into the world's first cryptocurrency.

What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies like the US dollar or the euro, Bitcoin does not rely on a central authority, such as a government or bank, to issue or regulate it. Instead, Bitcoin is powered by a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions happen directly between users, without an intermediary.

One of the core principles behind Bitcoin is the idea of decentralization. This is made possible by blockchain technology, which ensures that all transactions are recorded on a public ledger that everyone can access but no one can alter. Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and a way to achieve financial independence from traditional banking systems.

How Bitcoin Works

At its most basic level, Bitcoin is a form of digital money. But what sets it apart from traditional currency is the technology that makes it work. Bitcoin operates on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records every transaction made with Bitcoin. These transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography, ensuring that they are secure and irreversible.

Bitcoin can be sent from one person to another anywhere in the world without going through a middleman, such as a bank. This not only reduces fees but also makes Bitcoin transactions incredibly fast and efficient. Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in the process.

In addition to being used for transactions, Bitcoin is often viewed as a store of value, much like gold. As more people buy and hold Bitcoin, its price can increase, making it a potentially lucrative investment for the future.

How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?

Bitcoin mining is the process by which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are added to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. When these problems are solved, a new block is added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with newly created Bitcoin. This process is critical for securing the network and maintaining its decentralized nature.

Mining requires a significant amount of computational power and energy, which is why many miners join ""mining pools"" to combine resources and increase their chances of successfully mining a block. Over time, as more Bitcoins are mined, the reward for mining becomes smaller, making Bitcoin scarcer and, in theory, more valuable.

How to Buy Bitcoin

If you're interested in acquiring Bitcoin, there are several ways to do so. One of the most common methods is purchasing it through a cryptocurrency exchange. To buy Bitcoin, follow these steps:

Choose a reputable exchange - Select a trusted cryptocurrency exchange platform where Bitcoin is available. Create an account - Register on the exchange, providing necessary identification and verification as required by the platform. Deposit funds - Once your account is verified, deposit fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) into your account. Buy Bitcoin - With your deposited funds, navigate to the Bitcoin market, place an order, and purchase the amount of Bitcoin you want.

You can also buy Bitcoin directly from individuals through peer-to-peer platforms or Bitcoin ATMs. However, regardless of how you buy Bitcoin, securing it is of the utmost importance, which brings us to the next section -- how to store Bitcoin securely.

How to Store Bitcoin

Storing Bitcoin safely is a crucial step after purchase, and choosing the right type of wallet plays a significant role in ensuring your cryptocurrency's security. A wallet Bitcoin is essentially a tool that allows you to store, send, and receive Bitcoin. However, not all wallets offer the same level of security or features.

When it comes to securing your Bitcoin, self-custody is key. This means taking full control of your private keys -- the cryptographic keys that allow you to access your Bitcoin. Without control over your private keys, you are relying on third parties to safeguard your assets, which may expose you to potential risks such as hacking or mismanagement.

The Ledger Bitcoin wallet is an excellent solution for those who want the highest level of security and control. As a market leader in cryptocurrency wallets, Ledger has sold over 7 million devices globally. But why is the Ledger Bitcoin wallet trusted by so many?

Self-Custody of Private Keys

With a Ledger Bitcoin wallet, you are in full control of your private keys. This means that you, and only you, can access and manage your Bitcoin. Unlike storing your cryptocurrency on an exchange, where the exchange holds the private keys, self-custody ensures that you are the sole owner of your assets.

Security: Private Key Generated and Stored Offline

One of the most significant advantages of the Ledger Bitcoin wallet is its security. Your private keys are generated and stored offline, making it impossible for hackers to access them remotely. This feature provides an added layer of protection compared to online wallets or exchanges, which are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. This type of offline storage is often referred to as ""cold storage,"" and it's one of the safest methods for storing Bitcoin.

Ledger's Reputation as a Market Leader

With over 7 million devices sold, Ledger has established itself as a trusted name in the cryptocurrency industry. The company has a long-standing reputation for delivering high-quality, secure products that help users protect their digital assets. If you're serious about Bitcoin, using a Ledger Bitcoin wallet offers you peace of mind knowing that your investment is in good hands.

User-Friendly Ledger Live Bitcoin Wallet App

In addition to hardware security, Ledger offers the Ledger Live app, a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily manage your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The app enables you to check your balance, send and receive funds, and monitor the market, all from one convenient platform. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned Bitcoin user, the Ledger Live app makes managing your Bitcoin simple and intuitive.

If you're looking for a secure and trusted way to store your Bitcoin, we recommend using the Ledger Bitcoin wallet.

How To Use Bitcoin

Once you have stored your Bitcoin securely, you may wonder how to use it. Bitcoin can be used in a variety of ways, including:

Making purchases - More and more businesses, both online and offline, are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From e-commerce sites to coffee shops, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular payment method. Sending money internationally - Bitcoin allows for easy cross-border transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. This can be faster and cheaper than traditional wire transfers. Investing and trading - Many people hold onto Bitcoin as a long-term investment, while others actively trade it for profit. The volatility of Bitcoin's price makes it attractive for both short-term traders and long-term investors. FAQ about Bitcoin

Who created Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was created by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. To this day, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown. Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and mined the first block (called the ""genesis block"") in 2009.

Is Bitcoin a good investment?

Bitcoin's value has seen significant growth since its inception, and many view it as a good investment due to its potential for high returns. However, it's important to remember that Bitcoin is highly volatile. Its price can experience drastic fluctuations in short periods. While Bitcoin has been called ""digital gold"" by some, it's essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks before investing.

In conclusion, Bitcoin is more than just digital money -- it represents a revolutionary change in how we perceive and use currency. Whether you're buying, storing, or using Bitcoin, it's crucial to stay informed and take steps to protect your assets, and the Ledger Bitcoin wallet offers a secure and reliable way to store your Bitcoin and take full control of your financial future.

Ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,326.58 as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price the cryptocurrency reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $282.71 billion. It's up 45% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $282.71 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $78.80 billion, XRP at $53.74 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.88 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $282.71 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $306 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $291 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,326.58.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 122% year over year, compared to a 45% gain for ethereum.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

5 Next Cryptos to Explode Reviewed

In this section, we reviewed each crypto with high potential growth to help you make the right decision when choosing the next crypto to explode.

Crypto All-Stars - World's First-Ever Meme Vault

One of the next cryptocurrencies expected to explode in the near future is Crypto All-Stars. This unique meme project has the potential for massive growth because it combines all popular meme coins into one unified staking platform called the Meme Vault that brings together meme coin traders and investors in one location. Users can stake their favorite meme coins, such as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe, Bonk, and others, and get $STARS tokens in exchange.

Generally, Crypto All-Stars is designed for a specific community of crypto enthusiasts who want to combine gaming, trading, and earning into one fun platform. Its launch has attracted attention from gamers and collectors due to its creative rewards system and community-driven features. The more $STARS tokens an investor holds, the more staking rewards they can earn. This makes it a smart move to buy $STARS tokens now while they are still sold at a discount before the presale ends and the token potentially takes off.

According to many crypto analysts, there are several reasons why Crypto All-Stars could be one of the next cryptos to explode. One key reason is the growing interest in gaming ecosystems, which continue to be among the most lucrative and highly growing businesses in the world. The project taps into this thriving market, and its roadmap shows plans for even more innovations, like cross-platform utilities and partnerships with well-known gaming brands. These moves could help bring in even more users and drive up the value of $STARS tokens.

Crypto All Stars tokens are currently sold in a presale, which already has raised over $1.1 million only a few weeks after its launch, indicating investors' trust and excitement in this cryptocurrency. For more info regarding the token's price, you can watch the Crypto All-Stars price prediction below:

Currently, early investors can buy $STARS tokens for just $0.0014305 each and stake their tokens for an impressive 1,200% annual percentage yield (APY). However, this high yield is dynamic and will decrease as more tokens are staked, meaning early stakers get the best rewards.

Bitcoin - Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization

There's no need to introduce Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is frequently referred to as a ""safe haven"" in the crypto and the financial world. As a matter of fact, many people refer to Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" because it's seen as a reliable store of value over the long term. In recent years, it is also widely used as an alternative to currencies with high inflation. In short, Bitcoin could be the currency of the future.

But despite the fact that it's the most established digital currency, Bitcoin still has plenty of room for growth due to factors like institutional adoption, its limited supply, and increasing use around the world. More than anything else, its limited number of 21 million coins makes it an attractive option for those seeking security in an unpredictable market. Moreover, because Bitcoin is decentralized, it is less affected by external forces; therefore, its value is frequently kept even when other assets fall in value.

Recently, following a price drop, $23 billion worth of Bitcoin has been moved into addresses held by long-term investors, showing institutional involvement in the Bitcoin market. The Bitcoin halving event that recently happened in April 2024 could also potentially drive Bitcoin's next bull run, with several experts predicting that Bitcoin could hit $85,000 by 2025, an increase of around 55% from Bitcoin's current price of $55,300.

Moreover, Bitcoin is no longer an anti-government currency used on the sidelines of the economy. Bitcoin is now recognized by many governments, including the United States, and is used as legal tender in countries like El Salvador.

Most importantly, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the US stock market in 2024 brought in large amounts of capital. Events like these, along with Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the highly anticipated US elections, can greatly affect Bitcoin's price, making it a key asset in the crypto space.

Mega Dice Token - The #1 GameFi On SOL

Next on our list is Mega Dice Token, one of the most promising GameFi tokens out there. Built on the Solana blockchain, Mega Dice Token ($DICE) powers a gaming ecosystem that includes a casino and sportsbook, offering bonuses and rewards to players and making it a potential breakout token.

The Mega Dice Casino, which was founded in 2023 and is licensed by Curacao, is also expected to deliver one of the best crypto casino experiences available, with $DICE tokens at the center of everything. Surely, if the casino gains more popularity, the value of $DICE could soar, much like how BNB grew alongside Binance's success.

By using blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent gaming experience, Mega Dice Token is transforming the online casino world. Unlike many other online casinos, Mega Dice ensures verifiable fairness and decentralized gaming, giving players more trust in the platform. As a result, Mega Dice has managed to build a platform with 10,000 users, and its user base is growing exponentially.

Furthermore, Mega Dice stands out from other online casinos by offering a unique gaming experience, which includes limited edition NFTs, referral bonuses, and airdrop rewards. Some key features of the platform include staking options, daily rewards, and exclusive NFTs. On its platform, users can stake $DICE in one of three pools to earn regular annual yields and daily rewards based on their gaming performance. All of the above has led some analysts to predict up to a 1000x potential growth for the Mega Dice token's price.

Mega Dice also plans to buy back and burn tokens using a portion of its profits, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The total supply of $DICE is fixed at 420 million tokens, with 35% available during the presale at $0.116056 per token, which can be purchased in exchange for SOL, BNB, and ETH. Additionally, 10% of the tokens are reserved for staking rewards.

Investors who want to learn more about the MegaDice Token can stay updated with recent information by following them on X and visiting the presale page.

Ethereum - Second Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization

Another crypto coin that has the potential to explode is Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world and the most popular blockchain for smart contracts. Ethereum has been the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts for many years. And, with the recent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network now has better scalability, security, and sustainability. These improvements make Ethereum a very important investment for any serious crypto portfolio as they set the stage for future growth.

One of the reasons why Ethereum could explode soon is the shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), as it has significantly reduced Ethereum's environmental impact.

Moreover, earlier this year, the first Ethereum ETFs were approved and began trading on July 23. Although initial trading saw some outflows, analysts believe this could be a significant catalyst for Ethereum's future price growth. In the first five months, these ETFs might generate capital inflows ranging from $3 to $4.6 billion. This would lead to the purchase of 850,000 to 1.25 million ETH, potentially creating a supply shortage and driving prices higher.

In terms of price performance, Ethereum has been on a downtrend lately, currently trading around $2300. However, analysts still have a bullish outlook on Ethereum, especially when taking into account the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which is expected in Q4 2024.

All in all, Ethereum remains the most popular blockchain for developers, with most of the action in the crypto world, such as new crypto projects, play-to-earn games, and DeFi advances, happening on its platform. As Ethereum continues to grow, more developers will build on it, attracting even more users and increasing demand for ETH. Currently, Ethereum is priced at $2,324.8; however, some experts predict it could surpass $6,000 by 2025.

Shiba Shootout - The #1 Shiba Meme Coin

Another excellent altcoin worth watching in the upcoming months is Shiba Shootout, which is a fun, meme-based cryptocurrency that's gaining popularity thanks to its gamified features.

The $SHIBASHOOT token essentially allows holders to vote on project decisions and participate in features like the Lucky Lasso Lottery, where users can win crypto prizes and Savings Saddlebags. On its platform, users can earn Shiba tokens by taking part in interactive games and challenges, making it a fresh and exciting addition to the meme coin world.

One of the reasons why Shiba Shootout could explode is because Shiba Shootout combines entertainment with a reward system, making it stand out in the crowded meme coin space. Its growing community and unique approach to gamified rewards are likely to attract attention, especially as meme coins continue to capture investors' interest. With all of these features and the buzz around this token in the crypto community, analysts have set high expectations for the Shiba Shootout token.

So far, Shiba Shootout's presale has raised over $1 million in just a few months, indicating a strong demand for this crypto. One $SHIBASHOOT is currently trading for $0.0202, which, according to many analysts, is a discount price to what the coin might be traded when the presale ends. Also, if Shiba Inu continues to perform well, Shiba Shootout could benefit from the meme coin wave, delivering impressive gains to early investors. Its deflationary token burn also gives it a strong outlook, as reducing the supply could increase demand.

Overall, with its unique theme, strong community support, and long-term potential, Shiba Shootout could certainly be the next crypto to explode. For more information, check out the Shiba Shootout presale page below.

What is the Correlation Between the Crypto Market and the Stock Market?

Over the past few years, many analysts and crypto investors have wondered about the correlation between the stock and the crypto market.

Well, generally, the correlation between the stock market and the cryptocurrency market is complex and multi-faceted. While the two markets have distinct characteristics, they often move in tandem, especially during significant economic events. This is largely due to overlapping investor sentiment and the increasing institutional participation in both markets. When traditional markets are bullish, investors tend to have more risk appetite, prompting them to explore alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, which have historically offered higher returns despite their volatility.

For instance, one key reason for the correlation is the influence of global liquidity. When central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, implement policies that inject liquidity into the economy, both stocks and cryptocurrencies often benefit. Evidently, during periods of quantitative easing or low interest rates, investors seek to put their capital into assets with higher yield potential. Stocks and cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, often become attractive in such environments.

Another factor contributing to the correlation is the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios. Many institutional investors now view digital assets like Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio alongside stocks and bonds. This means that macroeconomic factors affecting stock market sentiment, such as changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, or geopolitical events, can also affect crypto markets.

Additionally, as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, they are increasingly subject to similar market forces that affect traditional financial assets, such as regulatory changes and shifts in global economic policy.

In short, cryptocurrency prices and stock prices indeed tend to move in parallel. However, it's important to note that while the correlation exists, cryptocurrencies remain far more volatile than stocks. This heightened volatility means that while they may follow stock market trends, their price movements can be significantly more exaggerated, both on the upside and downside.

When Will the Crypto Market Explode?

Predicting when the next major surge in the crypto market will occur is a bit challenging, but there are a few important factors and events that could trigger significant growth. When looking ahead, these events and trends are worth paying attention to, as they may play a crucial role in the next big price increase.

US Elections (2024)

The upcoming U.S. presidential elections in 2024 could have a major impact on the crypto market. If a candidate with a strong pro-crypto stance, like Donald Trump, wins the election, this could greatly boost confidence among investors as a government that supports cryptocurrencies might lead to more favorable regulations, less scrutiny, and increased adoption of digital assets.

This potential shift in policy could spark an influx of institutional money into the market and help push crypto prices higher. Investors often react positively when they believe political leaders will create a supportive environment for emerging technologies, so the election results could be a big catalyst for the market.

Federal Reserve Rate Cuts

The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions is another important factor to watch. When interest rates are high, investors tend to move their money into safer assets such as bonds, but when the Fed lowers interest rates, borrowing money becomes less expensive, and people are more inclined to invest in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.

Lower interest rates also make it easier for businesses to expand, which boosts the economy and stock markets and, by extension, can positively affect crypto markets. If the Fed cuts rates shortly, it could lead to a surge of capital into cryptocurrencies as investors look for higher returns. Also, historically, low interest rates have been linked to strong bull runs in the cryptocurrency market.

Technological Upgrades

Blockchain technology continuously evolves, and key upgrades could be a big driver of the next crypto boom. Ethereum, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, is constantly working on improving its network. For example, the move to Ethereum 2.0 and the integration of Layer 2 scaling solutions aim to make the network faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

These upgrades will not only improve Ethereum's performance but also attract more developers and users to the network. And as the technology behind major cryptocurrencies improves, it could lead to increased adoption and drive up prices. In addition, advances in other blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could further fuel interest in the market.

Institutional Adoption

Perhaps one of the most significant factors that could cause the crypto market to explode is the continued entry of institutional investors. When big players like hedge funds, banks, and corporations invest in crypto, it creates a wave of confidence in the market. We've already seen companies like BlackRock, PayPal, and Tesla getting involved in cryptocurrencies, whether through investments, partnerships, or enabling crypto payments. As more institutions adopt digital assets, the market becomes more legitimized and stable, which attracts even more investors. The growing interest from traditional financial firms signals that the future of cryptocurrencies is being taken seriously, and as institutional money flows in, it could lead to major price increases.

These factors, combined with a general increase in public awareness and interest in cryptocurrencies, make the market ripe for a potential explosion, and while it's impossible to pinpoint an exact date, keeping an eye on these key developments can give investors valuable insights into when the next big wave might hit.

"SafeWallet: A Comprehensive Exploration of Its Design, Functionality, and Security",https://techbullion.com/safewallet-a-comprehensive-exploration-of-its-design-functionality-and-security/,2024-09-12,TechBullion,"As cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular, the need for reliable and secure tools to manage digital assets has become more critical than ever. SafeWallet, a secure and versatile crypto wallet developed by SafeCryptoWallet.io, aims to provide users with an innovative solution for storing, managing, and transacting cryptocurrencies. This article offers a detailed overview of SafeWallet, focusing on the process of generating unique wallet addresses, its design and functionality, password management, and more.

In this article, we will look into the concepts surrounding cryptocurrency wallets in general, how SafeWallet fits into the crypto ecosystem, and examine the functionality of SafeWallet's core features.

Definition: What Is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet, also known as a crypto wallet, is a digital tool that allows users to securely store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. These wallets can be used for a wide variety of purposes, from managing large amounts of cryptocurrency for long-term storage to executing regular transactions or interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Crypto wallets do not store cryptocurrencies in a traditional sense; instead, they store private keys, which grant users access to their assets recorded on a blockchain. These keys are essential for validating and securing transactions, ensuring that only the rightful owner has access to their crypto assets.

Types of Crypto Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets come in different types, each designed to balance convenience, functionality, and security. The two primary categories of wallets are hot wallets and cold wallets.

Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are those connected to the internet, making them convenient for frequent transactions. Because of their connectivity, they are more susceptible to cyberattacks and hacks. Hot wallets are ideal for users who need quick access to their funds but also come with higher security risks. Examples include mobile wallets, web wallets, and some desktop wallets.

Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are offline and are therefore considered far more secure. They are typically used for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies. Examples of cold wallets include hardware wallets and paper wallets, which store private keys offline, away from potential online vulnerabilities.

SafeWallet: An Overview

SafeWallet stands out among crypto wallets for its robust security features and user-friendly design. Built by SafeCryptoWallet.io, SafeWallet has been carefully designed to cater to both beginners and advanced crypto users, making it easy to store, manage, and transact digital assets while offering top-tier security measures. The platform strikes an optimal balance between convenience and security.

SafeWallet Address Generation

One of the most critical components of SafeWallet's functionality is the process of generating unique wallet addresses. When a user creates a new wallet in SafeWallet, the app generates a unique cryptographic key pair. This key pair consists of a public key and a private key.

Public Key: Functions like an account number that can be shared with others to receive payments. It is mathematically linked to the private key and is used to derive the wallet address. Users can freely share their public keys without compromising the security of their funds. Private Key: Acts as the password or secret key to the user's wallet. This key must never be shared, as it grants full control over the wallet's funds. The private key is required for signing transactions and proving ownership of the associated funds.

The wallet address is generated by running the public key through a hashing algorithm, ensuring that each wallet is uniquely identifiable on the blockchain. SafeWallet's process for generating addresses is secure, ensuring that users' private keys are kept confidential and are never exposed during the generation process.

Design and Functionality of Passwords

SafeWallet's password management system is designed with user security as its priority. The passwords are used in conjunction with a private key to access the wallet, adding an extra layer of protection. SafeWallet requires users to create a strong, complex password when setting up their wallet.

Recovery Phrase

A core security feature of SafeWallet is its recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. Upon setting up a new wallet, users are provided with a recovery phrase that typically consists of 12 random words. This phrase is essential for recovering access to the wallet if the user's device is lost or damaged. The recovery phrase should be stored in a secure, offline location, as anyone who obtains it can access the associated wallet.

Ownership and the Role of Private Keys

A key concept in understanding cryptocurrency wallets like SafeWallet is that they do not store actual cryptocurrencies. Instead, they store private keys, which serve as proof of ownership and allow users to access the cryptocurrencies recorded on the blockchain.

The blockchain itself is a distributed ledger that records all transactions, and cryptocurrencies are represented as balances associated with a particular public address. Accessing these funds requires the corresponding private key, which is why safeguarding the private key is of utmost importance.

In non-custodial wallets like SafeWallet, users have full control over their private keys. This contrasts with custodial wallets, where a third-party entity (such as a cryptocurrency exchange) holds the private keys on behalf of the user. While custodial wallets offer convenience, they also introduce risks, as users must trust the third party to keep their funds safe.

Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets

As mentioned earlier, crypto wallets can be categorized into hot wallets and cold wallets. Each category has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two often depends on the user's specific needs.

Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are always connected to the internet, making them perfect for users who need frequent access to their cryptocurrencies. SafeWallet, as a mobile and software-based wallet, can be categorized as a hot wallet. Its constant connectivity allows for seamless transactions and quick access to funds, making it ideal for everyday use.

However, the trade-off is that hot wallets are more vulnerable to hacking attempts, malware, and phishing attacks. SafeWallet mitigates these risks through strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and secure password management.

Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, such as hardware wallets or paper wallets, store private keys offline. This makes them immune to most forms of online attacks, as there is no internet connection through which a hacker can gain access. Cold wallets are generally recommended for long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency that do not need to be frequently accessed.

Hardware wallets, like those offered by Ledger or Trezor, are popular cold wallet options. These devices store private keys in a secure, offline environment, ensuring maximum security.

Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets, such as SafeWallet, are highly convenient for users who need to access their crypto on the go. These wallets are apps installed on smartphones and allow users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency at their fingertips.

SafeWallet's mobile app is designed for ease of use without compromising security. It integrates with blockchain networks to allow users to quickly access their assets and perform transactions while maintaining a high level of protection for private keys.

Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. They are considered one of the most secure ways to store cryptocurrency. Since the private keys are never exposed to the internet, they are safe from online attacks.

While SafeWallet does not function as a hardware wallet, it can integrate with hardware wallets to provide an additional layer of security for users who prefer cold storage for long-term assets.

Software Wallets

Software wallets are digital programs that run on computers or mobile devices. SafeWallet, as a software wallet, provides a user-friendly interface for managing crypto assets. It offers advanced features such as password encryption, and support for multiple cryptocurrencies.

Software wallets, while convenient, are considered hot wallets and are therefore more vulnerable to online attacks compared to hardware wallets.

Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets

SafeWallet is a non-custodial wallet, meaning that users have full control over their private keys. This contrasts with custodial wallets, which are managed by third parties such as exchanges.

The non-custodial nature of SafeWallet gives users complete ownership of their crypto assets and reduces the risk associated with trusting third parties with private keys. However, it also means that users are solely responsible for safeguarding their private keys and recovery phrases.

Backup Importance and Recovery Phrases

Regular backups are critical for securing any cryptocurrency wallet. SafeWallet provides users with a recovery phrase during the wallet creation process. This recovery phrase is the key to restoring access to the wallet if the device it is installed on is lost, stolen, or damaged.

Without the recovery phrase, users could permanently lose access to their funds. Therefore, SafeWallet advises users to store the recovery phrase in a secure, offline location, such as a safe, to prevent unauthorized access.

Security Best Practices

SafeWallet places a strong emphasis on security. Here are some of the best practices recommended by SafeWallet to ensure the safety of user funds:

Store Private Keys Offline: While SafeWallet provides secure storage for private keys, users who store large amounts of cryptocurrency should consider keeping their private keys offline, either in a hardware wallet or a paper wallet. Backup Your Recovery Phrase: The recovery phrase is critical for restoring access to your wallet. Always store it in a secure location, and never share it with anyone. Use Strong Passwords: SafeWallet requires users to set up strong passwords to access their wallets. Using a complex, unique password significantly reduces the chances of being hacked. Beware of Phishing Scams: Phishing attacks are a common method used by hackers to steal private keys and recovery phrases. Users should be cautious of emails, websites, or messages that ask for sensitive information and always ensure they are interacting with the legitimate SafeWallet platform. Paper Wallets and Staking

While SafeWallet does not primarily function as a paper wallet, users can generate paper wallets as an extra layer of security. A paper wallet involves printing out the private and public keys on a piece of paper, which can be stored offline.

Cross-Platform Compatibility

SafeWallet offers cross-platform compatibility, meaning it can be used across multiple devices. Whether on a desktop, mobile phone, or tablet, users can access their SafeWallet account and manage their crypto assets seamlessly across all devices. This feature is particularly useful for users who need flexibility in how they manage their cryptocurrency holdings.

Conclusion

SafeWallet is a powerful and secure solution for managing cryptocurrencies. Its design and functionality prioritize user security, offering features like password encryption, two-factor authentication, multi-signature capabilities, and a recovery phrase for wallet recovery. With the ability to manage multiple cryptocurrencies, stake assets, and integrate with both hot and cold wallets, SafeWallet provides a versatile platform for both novice and experienced crypto users.

By adhering to best practices in password management, backing up recovery phrases, and taking advantage of advanced security features, SafeWallet users can confidently manage their digital assets while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or loss. Whether for regular transactions or long-term storage, SafeWallet is positioned as a reliable tool in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Developing a Cryptocurrency: Design and Implementation,https://coinpedia.org/blockchain-developers/developing-a-cryptocurrency-design-and-implementation/,2024-09-12,Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide,"Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.

Cryptocurrencies have come a long way from just being a wild idea shared by some tech enthusiasts. They are making waves across the globe and compelling us to change the way we think about money, ownership, and trust. This evolution began with Bitcoin and now has grown much larger adding more currencies like Ethereum, Tether, BNB, and many more.

Cryptocurrencies represent a transformative shift in how we perceive and manage money. This transition is not just about trading or investing in the new currencies but beyond that. This has changed the way financial systems work fundamentally. Businesses are gaining interest in this field due to which creating new cryptocurrencies has become a keen area of research for entrepreneurs, innovators, and developers.

Creating cryptocurrency isn't just about writing a code and hoping that it works. It is more about crafting a solution that is more secure, effective, and engaging, something that people will see and want to use. A cultivated cryptocurrency doesn't just justify its code but also sustains the market and grabs a spot in users' minds forever. To achieve this kind of success for your currency you need to understand the bigger picture rather than just being proficient in technical skills.

Imagine being able to create your own digital currency, that could potentially change the way people think about money and finance. Isn't it fascinating? This gives you a chance to innovate and create a digital currency that has a real impact on the entire community and be part of something truly transformative.

This article will guide you through the essential steps of designing a cryptocurrency, starting from the conceptual phase, where you define the purpose, audience, and unique value proposition of your currency.

Let's dive into the world of cryptocurrency creation, where technology meets innovation and you get the chance to shape the future of finance. Ready to begin? Let's get started!

To create a successful cryptocurrency one must consider all the aspects from the underlying design, technology, market needs, and implementation strategies.

This step is the beginning of the idealization of the currency, and it has research-based parameters to make the currency successful. But before diving into coding, it's crucial to clarify the purpose of the cryptocurrency you develop.

Objective: Think about a problem that interests you!

What unique value could your cryptocurrency provide to solve it? Start by identifying the market gap or a specific problem that your cryptocurrency will address. Write down your idea and consider how it could be implemented.

Define the clear purpose. For example, If you are creating a cryptocurrency for a peer-to-peer marketplace then the focus should be on ensuring the efficiency of the transactions.

Identify the problem:

Determine the Unique value proposition: Consider the elements on the basis that you can classify your cryptocurrency differently from others. It can be a unique feature, a better security mechanism, or a newer use case.

Example: If you're creating a cryptocurrency for a decentralized marketplace, your goal might be to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely.

Target Audience: Determine who will use your cryptocurrency and why. Pick if your cryptocurrency should run on a public blockchain that's open to all or a private one that's not. Like, Bitcoin runs on a public one, but you use Hyperledger Fabric for the private kind.

So let's say you're making a cryptocurrency for this secret finance company. Would you go with the public or the private blockchain? What's your reason?

Competitive Analysis: Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for positioning your cryptocurrency effectively. By studying existing cryptocurrencies, you can identify their strengths and weaknesses and determine how your cryptocurrency can stand out.

Key factors to consider:

Example: Research existing cryptocurrencies in the decentralized marketplace space like Ethereum and its ERC-20 tokens that are designed specifically for DeFi.

Public vs. Private: Decide whether your cryptocurrency will operate on a public blockchain (accessible to everyone) or a private blockchain (restricted access).

Example: Bitcoin operates on a public blockchain, while Hyperledger Fabric is used for private blockchains.

To learn more about the types and architecture of Blockchain, check this out! Public vs Private Blockchain. This could help you decide which way to go in the design phase.

This is an important step in the design of blockchain systems since consensus mechanisms determine how transactions are verified and added to their global state. Which consensus mechanism you opt for also affects the security, scalability, and energy efficiency of your cryptocurrency.

One must be wondering, what are consensus Mechanisms exactly?

Consensus Mechanisms are a set of protocols that the participating nodes(computers) in the distributed ledger of blockchain need to agree upon, after which the validation of transactions and creation of blocks takes place.

Proof of Work (PoW): Miners solve difficult math problems to determine which will add the next block onto the blockchain

Working Principle:

Example: PoW by Bitcoin is very secure but drains a lot of energy and unfortunately also less scalable.

Proof of Stake (PoS): Validators are selected to produce new blocks according to their applicable share of the network stake (#tokens held). Ethereum 2.0 uses PoS -- which is more energy-efficient and scalable than ACG-based (PoW), e.g., mining nodes on Bitcoin blockchains'.

Working Principle:

Example: Then PoS is a better idea than PoW, in case you are prioritizing scale-out of an energy-efficient system. For example, Ethereum 2.0 moved from PoW to PoS to solve the problem of scalability and environmental issues.

There are more types of consensus and a detailed description is provided in this article. Consensus Mechanism

This includes the way your cryptocurrency is governed, its total circulating supply as well as any incentives it brings to participants. Tokenomics tells you about the economic model your cryptocurrency will have, which includes its supply and distribution along with the incentives.

Types of Models:

Supply Model: The supply model of the crypto deals with how the total number of coins would be managed with time.

The supply model impacts scarcity and supply, Dilution and inflation as well as the overall economic model.

Distribution Model: The distribution model decides the initial allocation and further user distribution of the coins.

The Distribution model impacts the early investments, access, and initial distribution.

Example: Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, creating a sense of scarcity that can drive value. Alternatively, some cryptocurrencies use an inflationary model where new tokens are created over time to reward validators and maintain network security.

As you dive into cryptocurrencies, you need to decide if you're gonna whip up a fresh blockchain or just craft a token using an existing one. Both ways have their perks and hurdles. This section serves up the essential steps for both paths dishing out a guide for blockchain whizzes.

Depending on your requirements, you can either choose to create a new blockchain or go with creating a token on the existing blockchain.

Example: Building a new blockchain from scratch might involve using C++ (like Bitcoin) or Rust (like Polkadot).

For a Token on an Existing Blockchain:

For projects that don't essentially need a new blockchain, we can create a token on top of the existing blockchain which is more efficient and pocket-friendly.

1. Choose a Platform: Select the appropriate blockchain platform according to your requirements

2. Develop the Smart Contract: Write the smart contract code for your token. This includes specifying the token's name, symbol, total supply, and how it can be transferred.

Developing the smart contract includes the steps as follows:

3. Deploy the Smart Contract: Deploy the smart contract to the chosen blockchain network. For deployment first carry out the test deployment on the deployment environments and once it is successful go for the mainnnet deployment.

Example: Create an ERC-20 token using Solidity on Ethereum with a contract that defines the token's behavior.

Wallet Integration: Ensure that your cryptocurrency is compatible with popular cryptocurrency wallets.

Exchange Listings: Get your cryptocurrency listed on exchanges for trading. Listing your cryptocurrency on exchanges is vital because it allows for liquidity and trading.

Example: For an ERC-20 token, integration with MetaMask and listing on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap would be key steps.

Security is the heart and soul of blockchain technology. When you're developing a digital currency, there's simply no room for shortcuts when it comes to protecting your system. Every step of the way -- whether you're designing the blockchain, writing code, or planning the launch -- security has to be your top priority.

Think of it as building a fortress around your currency. If there's even a small crack in the walls, everything inside is at risk. That's why, from day one, you need to be thinking about how to safeguard your currency from potential threats. Missing this step isn't just risky -- it's unthinkable. It's what keeps your users' trust intact and ensures that your currency can thrive in the wild world of digital finance.

Hence, Auditing the code before deployment is the biggest and most important step.

Example: Conduct audits through firms like ConsenSys Diligence or Trail of Bits.

When you've finished developing and securing your digital currency, the next big step is the launch. This is where all your hard work, sleepless nights, and meticulous planning come together. The launch is more than just flipping a switch -- it's the moment your vision becomes a reality and your currency steps into the world.

Remember, a strong launch sets the tone for everything that follows. By combining technical excellence with a thoughtful, user-centered approach, you're not just launching a currency -- you're launching a movement.

Example: Regularly update your token's smart contract and address any security issues that arise. Stay on top of your crypto game by sprucing up your token's smart contract. Squash those pesky bugs, give the features a boost, and slam the door on security threats to make sure your crypto stays winning

Creating digital currency demands knowing the big ideas and techy bits, like figuring out why you're making it doing your homework on buyers, building the blockchain, keeping it safe, and handling the big release. It starts with a solid grasp of blockchain technology, moves through careful planning and design, and requires a strong focus on security to keep everything safe.

But that's not all. You also need to think about how your currency will be used, how to build trust with your users, and how to make sure it can grow over time. The launch is just the beginning; the real challenge is maintaining and improving your currency as the market evolves. By combining tech skills with creativity and strategic thinking, you can create a digital currency that not only works well but also captures people's imagination and stands the test of time.

How to Buy Floki Inu (FLOKI) * SHIBA Killer * Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-floki-inu,2024-09-12,Benzinga,"Our team is diligently working to keep up with trends in the crypto markets. Keep up to date on the latest news and up-and-coming coins.

Floki Inu (FLOKI) is a spinoff of the popular Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency. The coin originated from an Elon Musk tweet where he mentioned naming his Shiba Inu dog ""Floki."" This tweet generated significant interest in the crypto community, leading to the creation of Floki Inu and several copycat projects. Currently, FLOKI is down over 64% from its all-time high prices. This may present a buying opportunity for believers in the coin, but many investors see dog-themed cryptocurrencies as a bubble that has already popped. To make the decision for yourself, read more to find out what exactly Floki is and how you can buy it today.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to purchase FLOKI coin today.

One way to purchase FLOKI is through an online cryptocurrency exchange. Because the project is relatively new, it is only offered on a select number of exchanges. Gate.io is the easiest to navigate and offers the quickest route to FLOKI ownership.

For non-US customers -- Gate.io offers thousands of cryptocurrencies, one of which is FLOKI. To purchase FLOKI, you first must create an account on Gate.io. Doing so is easy and just requires an email and password. Next, you must fund your account.

Gate.io does not allow for fiat (U.S. dollar) transfers, so you must send cryptocurrency from another exchange account. Robinhood, eToro and Crypto.com are great choices.

If you're located in the U.S, you'll need to send Ethereum tokens to a cryptocurrency wallet. From there, you can use a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap to swap your ETH into FLOKI. Most platforms let you send ETH to a cryptocurrency wallet, such as Robinhood, eToro and Crypto.com.

Wallets differ from exchanges in that they let you hold custody of your digital assets, whereas a crypto exchange holds your private keys. You can choose from multiple forms of virtual wallets. Depending on how you go about buying FLOKI, having a wallet may be a necessity. The best software wallet to use on Uniswap is Metamask wallet, which you can download for free on the Google Chrome app store.

Once you have a balance in your MetaMask wallet, you can link the wallet to the Uniswap interface. If you use Gate.io, you can send your crypto directly from the exchange you purchased your ETH on. Using Gate.io, navigate to the FLOKI/USDT pair. To purchase FLOKI, you will have to swap the token with USDT. Choose the amount of USDT you would like to swap for FLOKI and execute the trade.

Afterwards, you should have FLOKI in your Gate.io account. On Uniswap, navigate to the ""Swap"" section. Select the FLOKI/WETH pair. You can then use your balance to swap your ETH for FLOKI, similar to the process on Gate.io.

Floki is a cryptocurrency meme coin that entices risk-tolerant investors with its low price per token. It operates on both the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain. The project has huge ambitions, including a Tesla giveaway and $100,000+ in charitable donations. The project is also looking to do work in the NFT sphere, helping with the distribution of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in their own blockchain-based video game.

However, these goals are unlikely to happen anytime soon. The project aims to link utilization and community. They want to make a platform that is useful and easy to use while creating a close-knit community of token holders. Holders are given rewards for storing the token, similar to coins like SafeMoon. These rewards are mostly given to the largest wallets, presenting a pyramid-scheme like structure. The coin currently has over 400,000 holders, with a market capitalization around $1.19 billion.

Floki Inu was created shortly after Elon Musk tweeted that his Shiba Inu dog would be named Floki. The project is hoping to be more than just a meme coin, looking to offer Floki Inu for in-store purchases and their own marketplace, ""Flokiplace."" The coin is the only project to partner with Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, and his Million Gardens Movement. The movement is aiming to tackle food insecurity worldwide. As the project evolved from a meme-coin to a more significant endeavor, the team underwent a rebranding to ""Floki.""

Initially listed for less than millionths of a cent, it soared over 250,000% in September 2021. The token has seen a surge in 2024, with over 250% growth year-to-date, and reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.0003462 on June 5. As of writing, FLOKI is trading for around $0.0001241, with a market capitalization of $1.19 billion.

To buy FLOKI, you can use either decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or PancakeSwap, or centralized exchanges such as Binance or Gate.io. Purchasing on a decentralized exchange requires swapping Ethereum or Binance Coin for FLOKI after setting up a cryptocurrency wallet. On a centralized exchange, FLOKI can be bought directly using fiat or other cryptocurrencies

Here are some of the best trading platforms you can use to get started with your FLOKI investment.

Now that you know how to buy Floki Inu you need to know how to store it safely. Here are a few of the best cryptocurrency wallets on the market:

Ledger is a hardware wallet that is extremely easy to use and supports the sending and receiving of Ethereum (ETH), which you may need to purchase FLOKI. Once you have purchased a Ledger hardware wallet, you simply download its software onto your computer and create an account. Ledgers support more than 1,000 different cryptos including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and all ERC-20 tokens (including FLOKI)

You'll be assigned a wallet address (typically a long string of letters and numbers), and then you can send and receive thousands of cryptocurrencies through the wallet. Hardware wallets offer an extra level of security as opposed to software wallets, but they cost money while software wallets are typically free.

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to store, send and buy cryptocurrencies. When you open a MetaMask account, you will be assigned an Ethereum wallet address, and you can add other tokens via the wallet's interface. In this instance, you'll need to add ETH. This will be the address you will send your ETH to.

You must open and fund an account on a centralized exchange like Robinhood, eToro and Crypto.com and purchase ETH there. On your exchange, navigate to your ETH position. From there, you should see an option to send your ETH. Click on this and enter the address from your cryptocurrency wallet. Hit send, and your ETH should be in your wallet within a few minutes.

To trade or convert your FLOKI, navigate to the pair of FLOKI and the desired token. The list is very short, however, so there is a likelihood you will not find the pair you are looking for. Once you have located the trading pair, you can do the same process you used to swap for FLOKI to convert it back to either ETH or USDT.

Enter the desired amount and execute the trade. Your position will then be in the other token. To sell, you can take the other token, such as USDT or ETH, and send it back to your centralized exchange. USDT is the most widely supported and therefore the easiest to use. Once the USDT is in your centralized exchange, you can convert it to USD and deposit it in your bank account.

Monitoring crypto prices is crucial for informed investment decisions. Check out our table below to stay updated on the price movements of major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, SOL and DOGE.

FLOKI is a high-risk, speculative project. It's returns have been massive, but it's unlikely that cryptocurrencies surviving off hype will be viable long-term investments. Floki Inu was a fantastic investment if you bought in early enough and sold near the top. Plus, the digital asset was rug pulled by previous developers that have since left the team. Floki Inu price increases have been the result of their social media presence instead of actual progress. Before investing in FLOKI, it's important to conduct due diligence by examining the project's fundamentals, the cryptocurrency landscape, and personal financial goals.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/07131122/FLOKI.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.1372549019607843
"Buy bitcoin, ether and other crypto ETFs with less risk. Just follow these tips.",https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240911313/buy-bitcoin-ether-and-other-crypto-etfs-with-less-risk-just-follow-these-tips,2024-09-11,Morningstar,"Cryptocurrency ETFs are safer than owning crypto itself - but you're still in unknown territory

With the rise of cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds, many investors believe they've found a safer way to dip into the volatile world of bitcoin (BTCUSD), ether (ETHUSD) and other digital assets. While crypto ETFs offer a layer of protection direct crypto investment lacks, they're not without their own set of risks. Here's what you need to know to protect your crypto holdings:

1. Keep it real: Investing in crypto through ETFs is generally safer than holding cryptocurrencies directly. You're not dealing with digital wallets, private keys or the risk of crypto-exchange hacks. Yet this apparent safety net can lull investors into a false sense of security. Remember, the underlying assets are still highly volatile, and this volatility will be reflected in the ETF's value.

During the bitcoin price crash of 2022, for example, when the popular crypto's value plunged more than 60% from its all-time high, ETFs tracking bitcoin's price saw similar declines. While ETFs protect you from some crypto-specific risks, they don't insulate you from market volatility.

2. Understand what you're buying: When you buy a crypto ETF, you're not getting a standard financial product. You're investing in a fund that holds or tracks cryptocurrencies or blockchain-related companies. You need to know how crypto trading operates. For instance, if your ETF is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, a sudden regulatory crackdown on bitcoin mining could significantly impact your investment. Similarly, a major security flaw discovered in Ethereum could tank the value of ETFs with large ether holdings.

Some crypto ETFs include stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology - ranging from crypto exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN) and mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), to Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants investing in blockchain. Publicly traded companies come with their own risks and potential rewards.

Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto ETFs face unique challenges when it comes to asset custody. The companies holding the actual cryptocurrencies for the ETF (known as custodians) are a potential point of failure. If a custodian's security is breached, it could lead to significant losses for the ETF and, by extension, your investment.

3. Custody matters: Always research the custodial arrangements of any crypto ETF you're considering. Look for ETFs that use reputable custodians with a track record of strong security measures, including cold storage for assets and comprehensive insurance policies.

Here's what to ask about an ETF's custodian:

What security measures are in place? Have they ever experienced a security breach? If so, how was it handled?Are multisignature wallets in use? What portion of assets is held in cold storage versus hot wallets? What insurance policies do they have, and what exactly do these policies cover?

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still in development, and this uncertainty extends to crypto ETFs. A sudden regulatory change could force an ETF to quickly sell off assets, potentially at unfavorable prices. In extreme cases, regulatory shifts could even lead to the delisting of an ETF.

Stay informed about the regulatory environment in the countries where your ETF operates. Be prepared for the possibility that rules could change rapidly, affecting your investment.

Consider these scenarios:

A country bans cryptocurrency mining, affecting the profitability of mining companies in your ETF's portfolio.New tax regulations are introduced, impacting the ETF's returns or reporting requirements.Stricter know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules are implemented, potentially limiting the ETF's ability to trade certain assets.

4. Liquidity trap: Crypto ETFs can face liquidity issues, especially during times of market stress. If a large number of investors try to sell their ETF shares simultaneously, the fund might struggle to sell its crypto holdings fast enough to meet redemption demands. This could lead to the ETF trading at a significant discount to its net asset value. Before investing, check the liquidity of the ETF and its underlying assets. Larger, more established funds tend to have better liquidity.

Here are some factors that can affect an ETF's liquidity:

Trading volume: Higher daily trading volumes generally indicate better liquidity.Assets under management: Larger funds usually have better liquidity.Spread: A narrow bid-ask spread often indicates good liquidity.Creation/redemption process: Understand how the ETF creates and redeems shares, as this can impact liquidity.

5. New scams: While crypto ETFs protect you from many traditional cryptocurrency scams, they've given rise to a new breed of fraudulent activities. Watch out for:

Fake ETFs: Scammers create fraudulent ETFs that mimic legitimate ones. Always verify an ETF's legitimacy through official channels like the SEC's EDGAR database.

Sophisticated phishing: Instead of trying to steal your crypto wallet keys, scammers might impersonate your broker or the ETF company to gain access to your investment account. These attacks can be highly targeted. For example, a scammer might use information from your social-media profiles to craft a convincing impersonation of your financial adviser, then try to persuade you to transfer funds or share account details.

Deepfake dangers: Some scammers use deepfake technology to impersonate financial advisers or ETF executives. Always verify the identity of anyone asking you to make investment decisions, especially if they're pressuring you to act quickly.

Pump-and-dump schemes: While not exclusive to ETFs, pump-and-dump schemes can target smaller or newer crypto ETFs. Scammers might spread false information to inflate the price of an ETF or its underlying assets, then sell their holdings once the price has risen.

Front-running: This is when someone with advance knowledge of a large pending transaction uses that information for their own profit. In the context of ETFs, an unethical insider might use knowledge of the ETF's rebalancing schedule to trade the underlying assets beforehand.

Tracking error

Crypto ETFs, especially those using futures contracts rather than holding cryptocurrencies directly, can suffer from tracking error. This means the ETF's performance may not perfectly mirror the performance of the underlying assets it's meant to track.

Factors contributing to tracking error include:

Management fees Transaction costsDifferences between spot and futures prices (for futures-based ETFs)Rebalancing frequency

Protecting your portfolio

How can you safeguard your investments? Here are some key steps:

1. Do your homework: Thoroughly research any ETF before investing. Understand its holdings, management team, and track record. Look into the fund's prospectus, which will detail its investment strategy, risks, and fees. Pay attention to the expense ratio - while crypto ETFs tend to have higher fees than traditional ETFs, excessive fees can eat into your returns.

2. Secure your brokerage account: Use strong, unique passwords and hardware-based two-factor authentication. Be wary of using public Wi-Fi for accessing your investment accounts.

3. Stay informed: Keep up with news about the cryptocurrencies your ETF holds and any regulatory developments. Follow reputable financial news sources and consider setting up alerts for news related to your investments.

4. Diversify: Don't concentrate your portfolio. Crypto ETFs should be part of a diversified portfolio, not your maininvestment strategy. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when deciding what portion of your portfolio to allocate to crypto ETFs.

5. Be skeptical: If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be especially wary of unsolicited investment advice or pressure to act quickly. Take the time to verify information independently before making any investment decisions.

6. Understand the tax implications: Crypto ETF investments can have complex tax implications. Consult with a tax professional to understand how your investments might affect your tax situation.

7. Use reputable brokers: Only invest through well-known, regulated brokers. Check their credentials and read reviews from other users.

8. Monitor investments regularly: Keep an eye on your ETF's performance and any changes in its underlying assets or management strategy. However, avoid the temptation to make knee-jerk reactions to short-term market movements.

By understanding these unique challenges and taking proactive steps, you can navigate the crypto ETF landscape safely and confidently. Remember, in the world of investing, knowledge isn't just power - it's protection.

Cryptocurrencies are relatively new,https://times.mw/cryptocurrencies-are-relatively-new/,2024-09-11,The Times Group Malawi,"DUTTA -- Some believe it will revolutionise the financial system

Cryptocurrency has been a buzzword in the world of finance and technology. However, despite its growing popularity, many people still have questions about what cryptocurrency really is and how it works. Journalist WILLIAM KUMWEMBE engages finance expert Partha Dutta, a chartered accountant, on how cryptocurrencies work.

Firstly, what is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of money that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, such as the US dollar or Euro, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralised networks based on blockchain technology. This means they are not controlled by any central authority, like a government or financial institution, making them free from traditional banking regulations. Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency, and since then, thousands of cryptocurrencies have emerged.

How does cryptocurrency work?

Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, a decentralised ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. When a transaction is made, it is grouped with others in a ""block"" and then verified by a network of computers, known as ""nodes"". Once verified, the block is added to the blockchain, and the transaction is completed. The key to cryptocurrency's security is cryptography, which ensures that transactions are legitimate and that no one can alter or counterfeit the currency. Blockchain's decentralised nature also makes it resistant to hacking or fraud, as there is no single point of failure.

What are some popular cryptocurrencies?

There are a number of them on the market. First is Bitcoin: It was created by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Then there is Ethereum, which is known for its smart contract functionality. It is more than a cryptocurrency; it is a platform for decentralised applications (dApps). And then there is the Ripple. Focused on facilitating cross-border payments, Ripple aims to make financial transactions faster and cheaper, especially in the banking sector.

Why are cryptocurrencies considered volatile?

Cryptocurrency prices are known for their volatility, with prices often experiencing dramatic rises and falls in short periods. This volatility is due to several factors. Firstly, there is market speculation: Cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, and their value can be heavily influenced by speculation. News of regulatory changes, technological developments or influential endorsements can cause sudden price swings. And, also, there is a limited supply: Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have a finite supply. For example, only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. As more people buy and hold cryptocurrency, the limited supply can drive up prices, especially when demand surges. And then there is the element of regulation: Since cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional financial systems, they are not as heavily regulated.

How do I buy cryptocurrency?

To buy cryptocurrency, you typically need to choose a cryptocurrency exchange. Popular platforms include Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. These exchanges allow you to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. And then one needs to create an account. You will need to provide personal information, and depending on the platform, you may be required to verify your identity. The next step is deposit funds: You can usually deposit money via a bank transfer, credit card, or sometimes PayPal. After depositing, you can use these funds to purchase cryptocurrencies. From there, you can store your cryptocurrency. Once you have purchased cryptocurrency, you'll need to store it. You can keep it on the exchange or transfer it to a private wallet (software or hardware) for added security.

What are the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency?

While cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with significant risks. They include market volatility. As mentioned earlier, cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to potential losses for investors. Also, there are security risks associated with it. Despite the security of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacking. If an exchange is hacked, or if users lose access to their wallets, recovering their funds can be difficult, if not impossible. Further, there are regulatory uncertainties. Governments are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies. New regulations or crackdowns could affect the value and legality of certain digital assets. Last but not the least is the element of fraud and scams. The lack of regulation and anonymity associated with cryptocurrency has led to an increase in fraudulent schemes. Investors need to be cautious and avoid scams, such as fake initial coin offerings or Ponzi schemes.

Why are people investing in cryptocurrencies?

There are several reasons people are drawn to cryptocurrencies: firstly, there is potential for high returns: Many early investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen substantial gains. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, which means they can rise (or fall) in value rapidly, offering the potential for significant profit. Also, there is a sense of decentralisation. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of governments and central banks, appealing to people who value financial independence and privacy. There is a hedge against inflation: Some investors view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as ""digital gold"" because they are limited in supply. This can make them attractive as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Another vital aspect is technological innovation: Many are investing not only in the currency but also in the underlying blockchain technology, which has wide applications beyond digital money, such as in supply chain management, voting systems and healthcare.

What is the future of cryptocurrency?

The future of cryptocurrency is a hot topic. Some believe it will revolutionise the financial system, while others are more skeptical. Governments around the world are exploring or developing their own digital currencies, which could coexist with or challenge decentralised cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies become more popular, regulatory frameworks are likely to evolve, offering more clarity for investors and users. Increasingly, traditional financial institutions are beginning to embrace cryptocurrency, offering investment products like Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and blockchain-based services.",https://times.mw/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dutta.jpg?w=640,0.08235294117647052
"How to buy bitcoin, ether and other crypto ETFs with more security and less risk",https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240911860/how-to-buy-bitcoin-ether-and-other-crypto-etfs-with-more-security-and-less-risk,2024-09-11,Morningstar,"Crypto ETFs are safer than owning cryptocurrencies outright - but you're still in unknown territory

With the rise of cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds, many investors believe they've found a safer way to dip into the volatile world of bitcoin (BTCUSD), ether (ETHUSD) and other digital assets. While crypto ETFs offer a layer of protection direct crypto investment lacks, they're not without their own set of risks. Here's what you need to know to protect your crypto holdings:

1. Keep it real: Investing in crypto through ETFs is generally safer than holding cryptocurrencies directly. You're not dealing with digital wallets, private keys or the risk of crypto-exchange hacks. Yet this apparent safety net can lull investors into a false sense of security. Remember, the underlying assets are still highly volatile, and this volatility will be reflected in the ETF's value.

During the bitcoin price crash of 2022, for example, when the popular crypto's value plunged more than 60% from its all-time high, ETFs tracking bitcoin's price saw similar declines. While ETFs protect you from some crypto-specific risks, they don't insulate you from market volatility.

2. Understand what you're buying: When you buy a crypto ETF, you're not getting a standard financial product. You're investing in a fund that holds or tracks cryptocurrencies or blockchain-related companies. You need to know how crypto trading operates. For instance, if your ETF is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, a sudden regulatory crackdown on bitcoin mining could significantly impact your investment. Similarly, a major security flaw discovered in Ethereum could tank the value of ETFs with large ether holdings.

Some crypto ETFs include stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology - ranging from crypto exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN) and mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), to Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants investing in blockchain. Publicly traded companies come with their own risks and potential rewards.

Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto ETFs face unique challenges when it comes to asset custody. The companies holding the actual cryptocurrencies for the ETF (known as custodians) are a potential point of failure. If a custodian's security is breached, it could lead to significant losses for the ETF and, by extension, your investment.

3. Custody matters: Always research the custodial arrangements of any crypto ETF you're considering. Look for ETFs that use reputable custodians with a track record of strong security measures, including cold storage for assets and comprehensive insurance policies.

Here's what to ask about an ETF's custodian:

A sudden regulatory change could force an ETF to quickly sell off assets, potentially at unfavorable prices. In extreme cases, regulatory shifts could even lead to the delisting of an ETF.

Stay informed about the regulatory environment in the countries where your ETF operates. Be prepared for the possibility that rules could change rapidly, affecting your investment.

Crypto Hack: Indonesia's Indodax Goes Offline After Suspected $22M Breach | Bitcoinist.com,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-hack-indonesias-indodax-goes-offline-after-suspected-22m-breach/,2024-09-11,Bitcoinist.com,"Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange Indodax is the latest to fall victim to a hack, resulting in the theft of approximately $22 million in digital assets.

According to a post by blockchain security firm SlowMist on X, the hackers stole digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), multiple ERC-20 tokens from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, TRX and USDT tokens from the Tron (TRX) blockchain, Polygon (POL), and ETH from the Optimism (OP) blockchain. The total loss is estimated to be around $22 million.

Indodax confirmed the hack and has temporarily paused all platform operations due to ""maintenance"" activities. The trading platform has assured its users that their crypto funds are safe. The exchange said:

Currently, we are conducting a complete maintenance to ensure the entire system is operating properly. During this maintenance process, the INDODAX web platform and application are temporarily inaccessible.

Founded in 2014, Indodax primarily serves the Indonesian crypto market and recorded a total trading volume of slightly more than $11 million in the past 24 hours.

SlowMist's analysis ruled out any possible hot wallet hack. Rather, the blockchain security firm notes that it is possible that Indodax's withdrawal system was compromised, which gave hackers access to the exchange's hot wallet and the ability to withdraw funds seamlessly.

Similarly, digital assets security firm Cyvers noticed ""multiple suspicious transactions involving wallets on different networks."" The wallet address suspected of orchestrating the hack could be observed swapping different tokens to ETH. While it remains to be seen what the hacker's next moves will be, they typically leverage cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash to obscure the trail of their crypto transactions.

Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Indodax has sufficient reserves to compensate for the lost funds. At press time, Indodax's total financial reserves are worth $367 million, and the bulk of their funds are distributed among digital currencies such as BTC, ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and USDT. However, data from Arkham Intelligence estimates the total figure to be even higher, at $409 million.

Yosi Hammer, head of AI at Cyvers told BSCN that the characteristics and patterns of the Indodax hack closely resemble those of the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

Close followers of the crypto industry would know of Lazarus, the infamous hacking group responsible for executing multiple high-profile hacks over the past few years. For instance, the recent hack of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX is linked to Lazarus, which resulted in a loss of $234 million in user funds.

A recent report by Immunefi noted that hackers are keeping up with advances in security in the crypto industry as the value of total stolen funds has increased by 15.5% compared to 2023 for the same period. BTC trades at $56,701 at press time, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

When making investments in cryptocurrencies, the timing of making such an investment is key. Since technology keeps on changing, the markets evolve or new trends come into place; some of the cryptocurrencies become good candidates to buy immediately with the aim of making some profit out of it. As the bitcoin market continues to change with Bitcoin becoming much more popular and more competing digital currencies appearing, it becomes key to understand which digital currencies will be popular by 2024. This article will assist you in rooting for the most promising coins right now according to the strengths of the crypto market.

The potential returns on investing in cryptocurrencies are evident, but one has to appreciate the challenges, more so on volatility in the market structure. That said, investors can point towards several important factors that are critical when weighing whether or not a cryptocurrency is a good buy at a specific moment:

Rising asset value and growth in asset volume is an indication of confidence from investors. When there is continuous upward movement then there is strong backing from investors in the market with immediate profits to be made.

Investors prefer waiting in long queues to put their money into projects where there is a new technology launched or decisive technology updates such as improved scalability and more security. New improvements imply that growth is expected even in the future.

Certain events like partnerships, protocol upgrades, or the coin being listed on exchanges are followed by price increases. There is an opportunity for investors to take advantage of such anticipated price rises before such events happen.

Cryptocurrencies that offer simple and effective solutions to existing problems fill in the gap much quicker. A well-defined use case guarantees the success of the project for a very long period of time.

Paying attention to community and developer engagement is needed to stay positive and grow despite the competition being faced in the market.

Projects with this sort of market operate normally under good regulations, while projects under no such regulations become risky. Keeping track of any such developments is needful.

Cryptocurrencies that can be used on applications like payment systems or DeFi are more likely to achieve higher rates of adoption and consequently long-term viability.

Institutions working on solid projects with good partnerships are more durable, have wider outreach and get more adoption.

Under this feature, investors will concede that most coins, which were able to recover after the intense summer crash or grow continuously, are more valuable investments and suggest strong management and innovation of the projects.

Below, we will make a case for each of these cryptocurrencies, outlining the reasons for the anticipated appreciation throughout 2024. Among other things, the discussion will include their performance and position in the market, technological aspects and future news that may boost their popularity.

Bitcoin is the first popularised cryptocurrency. Its current market valuation is 1.2 trillion US dollars. As a form of digital currency that works in a decentralized manner, bitcoin is well-known as a media of exchange or as a store of value, often inclusively described as 'digital gold.' The impressive development of Bitcoin is aided by the willingness of both institutional and retail investors.

Why It's a Good Buy: Investors still find Bitcoin to be the best and the most accepted digital asset. In 2024, this craving will be enshrined by the forthcoming halving event, which is going to cut the state's subsidy of the Block and increase the value of Bitcoin. Statistically, there has been a general price surge of Bitcoin after halving in the past. '' Additionally, Bitcoin is becoming more and more integrated into traditional financial networks like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and payment systems and thus its growth perspective is only enhanced.

Potential Risks: Even with these advantages, Bitcoin is not a safe investment. The price is very erratic and subject to depreciation for various reasons including but not limited to regulation and changes in the market. In addition, there are concerns about the energy efficiency of Bitcoin that some critics have pointed out which may spark regulation.

Ethereum, currently the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market creation, tops the chart in terms of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Having a market cap of ‪289.17 B‬ USD billion, Ethereum has put itself on the map as one of the most fundamental building blocks of the blockchain structure.

Why It's a good buy: Anyone who keeps track of Ethereum and isn't particularly interested in its application already knows that the shift of Ethereum from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), or Ethereum 2.0, is a big deal. This boost improves just about everything including the scalability, security and energy efficiency of the network making it easier for development and investments. Ethereum's ecosystem remains to grow in 2024, with DeFi and NFTs creating demand for ETH.

Potential risks: As a smart contract platform, Ethereum is at risk of competition from other players like Solana and Cardano which offer cheaper fees and faster transaction quality. Also, Ethereum's price and its use could be affected by the delays in Ethereum 2.0's implementation as well as any unexpected problems that may occur along the way.

Solana is a fast and cost-effective blockchain that has high transaction processing power. As of writing, Solana's market cap is about $60 billion and from deep within has managed to appeal to developers and investors who wish to invest in alternatives to Ethereum.

Why It's a Good Buy: Due to the combination of the 'Proof of History and Proof of Stake' consensus mechanism, Solana can carry out thousands of transactions every second. There has been great attraction of dApps, DeFi projects, and NFTs to the Solana ecosystem because of this scalability. In 2024, however, this growth of Solana's user experience and developer's tools will enable it capture new markets.

Potential Risks: There is also the problem of the network being unavailable for some time which has happened with Solana in the past which brings concern to the trust factor. Since it is a new entrant, there are ongoing disruptive strategies that it must engage, to be at the fore of competition against other established blockchains such as Ethereum.

Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that seeks sustainability, scalability, and interoperability. A market cap of around $11.52 billion places Cardano in the spotlight for its academic-driven development and community engagement.

Why It's a Good Buy: There is no doubt that the nature of Cardano, which is peer-reviewed and assembles formal verification on its platform, is powerful. The upcoming Hydra upgrade in 2024 which is expected to address the issue of scalability on Cardano, particularly in the number of users and developers is expected to be in hot demand. Lastly, the capability of Cardano in developing countries, offering blockchain-native applications is quite a refreshing concept.

Potential Risks: Owing to this focus on planning, collecting an appropriate amount of evidence through testing and research before development can result in Cardano experiencing slow growth. Even though this approach guarantees security and reliability, it also means that few upcoming technologies might be adopted late in the day, because Cardano will take too long.

Polkadot is intended for the integration of all existing and future blockchains. Currently valued at approximately $5.7 billion in market cap, Polkadot is leading the efforts for blockchain evolution where interoperability and scalability are key requirements.

Why It's a Good Buy: The architecture of Polkadot is advantageous as it has a central relay chain and many accompanying parachains thus blockchains can communicate with one another. This feature is very important for decentralized finance and cross-chain applications in the future. In 2024 the growing ecosystem of parachains and widening usability of Polkadot make it a tough one for prolonged investment.

Potential Risks: One of the risks regards the possibility of Polkadot achieving success is the expansion of its parachains. Further backlogs or glitches in technology within this front could undermine its growth. Also, there are rising challenges from other interoperability markets like the Cosmos project which is a threat to its position.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network whose core function is to provide smart contracts with external information. It has emerged as critical by the Total Market Cap of around $6.2 billion of the DeFi space thanks to the reliable provision of data.

Why It's a Good Buy: The role played by Chainlink in the DeFi sector can never be downplayed. As the DeFi industry continues to evolve, the requisite need for trustworthy oracles such as Chainlink will only be necessary. Chainlink will have room for more growth in 2024 tapping the ultimate evolution of cross-chain, data feed and decentralized identity.

Potential Risks: The major risk faced by Chainlink is the competition from newer Oracle services. Chainlink is perhaps the most widely used in the market today; however, changes in rival companies could change that. Also, the broader cryptocurrency market's performance could impact Chainlink's adoption and price.

Avalanche is an ecosystem that facilitates the development of Dapps and carries out enterprise blockchain solutions in a single highly scalable interoperable system. Within less than a year of inception, Avalanche has a focus on market capitalization of about $20 billion.

Why It's a Good Buy: Its consensus protocol enables it to be able to handle transactions in less than one second making it one of the fastest if not the fastest in the Blockchain space. In the year 2024, with the growing ecosystem that includes DeFi projects, NFTs and enterprise solutions, Avalanche will be a good investment option. The platform is also very flexible as it supports both decentralized and centralized blockchains.

Potential Risks: Avalanche must see off competition from Solana, Ethereum and other upcoming scalable blockchains. Also, any technical technical and security challenges and weaknesses might affect Avalanche's reputation and adoption.

Ripple is a digital payment protocol that facilitates instant and cheap transfers of money internationally. It is the 3rd largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $31.12B market cap, and relatively is an active cryptocurrency in payment systems.

Why It's a Good Buy: Ripple faced several issues in the SEC Courtroom which created caution toward XRP but at the same time presented leveraged opportunities for risk-oriented traders. If Ripple manages to prevail with their disputes, there is a huge possibility of an XRP spike in price. Moreover, the company continues building its presence in the market through partnerships with various financial institutions.

Potential Risks: The most important risk for the XRP remains the court case against the SEC. A negative outcome would trigger potential ranging from penalties to limitations of operations and issues to even delisting from leading exchange platforms. Furthermore, a threat of change is presented by emerging digital payment systems competing against XRP such as Stellar.

Polygon is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that caters to the need for faster transactions and lower fees. It has a market cap of approximately $1.79B thus making it an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem.

Why It's a Good Buy: The rapidly growing demand for DeFi and NFTs as well as the ever-emerging soft infrastructure demands Polygon's proportion in Ethereum networking, as a scaling solution. In 2024, Polygon aims to break into new markets including gaming and enterprise solutions, which sets the company up for more growth. It acts as a good draw for both the developers and the users due to reasonably priced cautious charges and rapid transactions.

Potential Risks: Since Polygon is essentially bolted onto Ethereum, any problems or delays in the Ethereum development roadmap fetters also Polygon's performance. Besides that, it has competition from other layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism that pose a threat to Polygon dominance.

Cosmos is an interesting project as it is essentially a network of multiple blockchains, which are independent but capable of interoperating with one another. Holding approximately 1.5 billion dollars in total market cap, Cosmos seeks to lead the sector of multi-blockchain network technology.

Why It's a Good Buy: The inter-chain Nature of Cosmos will be its bargaining tool with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol which will enhance data and assets transfer from one blockchain to another. Such a feature would be much needed in the decentralized finance of tomorrow's world as well as in future applications that might integrate different chains. In 2024, Cosmos's growing ecosystem and the increasing adoption of its IBC protocol make it a strong candidate for investment.

Potential Risks: The success of Cosmos fundamentally resides in the user acceptance of its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and the development of its ecosystem. Any stagnation or technical difficulties in these aspects may limit its expansion. Besides, there are other interoperability solutions available on the market, such as Polkadot, causing some competition.

However tempting the idea of investing in cryptocurrency may be, there are some factors that ought to be put into consideration before venturing into such investments:

Cryptocurrencies are prone to heavy price fluctuations. Formulating a long-term plan aids in reducing the risk of making rash decisions based on market fluctuations in the near future.

One should carefully watch the prevailing affairs since the changing laws, taxes, or policies in one area can be felt in the cryptocurrency market.

Determine the purpose, uniqueness, builders, and the public around the cryptocurrency in question and assess its feasibility of mass adoption.

Investments should be carried out through trusted exchanges and digital currency hardware wallets where hacking, fraud, and phishing should be defended against.

Invest in different altcoins in order to minimise risk and increase the chances of returns.

Just like any other asset, however, cryptocurrencies can also face the challenge of liquidity. Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to be highly liquid, making it easier to trade, but small coins possess lower liquidity which provides a strain when the market fluctuates.

One should prefer projects where management is more open and responsive, roadmaps and other necessary reimbursement steps are constantly being updated, and preventive measures are employed.

Sustained growth in some cryptocurrencies is easier due to a large number of users who have embraced the system as well as a network effect.

There are external economic conditions like price shifts or the level of progress in the cryptocurrency market that affect the demand as well as the performance of a particular cryptocurrency.

Analyze the risks associated with the technology provision, for example, potential flaws, blockages, and other factors that may lead to technology becoming outdated.

A vigorous, engaged community and healthy ecosystem is crucial for a cryptocurrency's innovation and growth for a long period of time.

Due to the fact that market movements are closely related to the impact of the investor's intention, it is likely that market sentiments will be closely monitored in order to anticipate movements and make suitable decisions.

Determining the precise criteria of one's entry and exit enables discipline in investing and promotes adequate return on every investment made.

Investing in Cryptocurrencies can be quite an interesting and tough investment option. The Cryptocurrencies listed in this article are quite promising for the year 2024, hence their immediate investment. However, it is necessary to carry out adequate due diligence as well as risk assessment for any of the investments. Limiting oneself to knowledge only and making strategic movement would avail one of the opportunities provided in the highly volatile Crypto market and this ensures good returns.",https://150601093.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/133-1-scaled.jpg,0.4352941176470588
Crypto Hack: Indonesia's Indodax Goes Offline After Suspected $22M Breach | Bitcoin Ethereum | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/606c3-crypto-hack-indonesias-indodax-goes-offline-after-suspected-22m-breach,2024-09-11,CryptoRank,"Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange Indodax is the latest to fall victim to a hack, resulting in the theft of approximately $22 million in digital assets.

According to a post by blockchain security firm SlowMist on X, the hackers stole digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), multiple ERC-20 tokens from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, TRX and USDT tokens from the Tron (TRX) blockchain, Polygon (POL), and ETH from the Optimism (OP) blockchain. The total loss is estimated to be around $22 million.

Indodax confirmed the hack and has temporarily paused all platform operations due to ""maintenance"" activities. The trading platform has assured its users that their crypto funds are safe. The exchange said:

Currently, we are conducting a complete maintenance to ensure the entire system is operating properly. During this maintenance process, the INDODAX web platform and application are temporarily inaccessible.

Founded in 2014, Indodax primarily serves the Indonesian crypto market and recorded a total trading volume of slightly more than $11 million in the past 24 hours.

SlowMist's analysis ruled out any possible hot wallet hack. Rather, the blockchain security firm notes that it is possible that Indodax's withdrawal system was compromised, which gave hackers access to the exchange's hot wallet and the ability to withdraw funds seamlessly.

Similarly, digital assets security firm Cyvers noticed ""multiple suspicious transactions involving wallets on different networks."" The wallet address suspected of orchestrating the hack could be observed swapping different tokens to ETH. While it remains to be seen what the hacker's next moves will be, they typically leverage cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash to obscure the trail of their crypto transactions.

Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Indodax has sufficient reserves to compensate for the lost funds. At press time, Indodax's total financial reserves are worth $367 million, and the bulk of their funds are distributed among digital currencies such as BTC, ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and USDT. However, data from Arkham Intelligence estimates the total figure to be even higher, at $409 million.

Yosi Hammer, head of AI at Cyvers told BSCN that the characteristics and patterns of the Indodax hack closely resemble those of the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

Close followers of the crypto industry would know of Lazarus, the infamous hacking group responsible for executing multiple high-profile hacks over the past few years. For instance, the recent hack of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX is linked to Lazarus, which resulted in a loss of $234 million in user funds.

A recent report by Immunefi noted that hackers are keeping up with advances in security in the crypto industry as the value of total stolen funds has increased by 15.5% compared to 2023 for the same period. BTC trades at $56,701 at press time, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

Unlocking the Swiss Crypto Haven: A Deep Dive into the Country's Booming Market and Regulatory Landscape - News Directory 3,https://www.newsdirectory3.com/unlocking-the-swiss-crypto-haven-a-deep-dive-into-the-countrys-booming-market-and-regulatory-landscape/,2024-09-10,News Directory 3,"Zurich⁢ Cantonal Bank Launches Trading and Custody Services for Bitcoin and Ethereum

Zurich Cantonal Bank⁣ (ZKB), one of the largest cantonal banks in Switzerland, has officially launched trading and custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the announcement, ZKB ⁢customers can conduct cryptocurrency transactions around⁣ the clock through the bank's electronic banking and mobile banking platforms. ZKB also provides secure cryptocurrency custody⁢ services to ensure that customers do not need to keep⁣ their private⁣ keys themselves.

ZKB's service is not only for ⁣individual customers, but also ⁣provides support for other⁣ third-party banks. As ⁢a B2B (business-to-business) solution, it enables other Swiss⁤ banks to provide trading and secure storage services for⁣ Bitcoin⁣ and Ethereum⁤ to their⁢ customers. The first cooperative bank to use the service is Thurgau Cantonal Bank, which trades through Crypto Finance AG, a financial technology company, a subsidiary of the German Stock Exchange Group.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is one of the first ⁤financial regulators in the world⁢ to develop a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. FINMA ⁢ensures the legality and transparency of cryptocurrency businesses through its Swiss⁢ Blockchain Act and Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA). The agency provides clear guidelines for companies engaged in cryptocurrency⁤ business and requires these companies to obtain the corresponding licenses, such as a Fintech License or a DLT Trading Platform License.

FINMA's regulatory framework emphasizes the⁤ following core principles:

The Swiss canton of Zug is known as the ""Crypto ⁣Valley"" for its early acceptance⁣ and⁢ promotion of cryptocurrency. ⁣The region has attracted ⁣a large number of blockchain and cryptocurrency companies and⁤ is the core of global blockchain technology innovation. Blockchain companies such as ⁢the Ethereum Foundation and Cardano have offices in the region.

The rapid development of Crypto Valley is due to the following factors:

Switzerland is not only a leader in cryptocurrency regulation, but also has global influence in blockchain technology application and innovation. Switzerland's SIX Digital Exchange is one of the⁢ world's first digital asset trading platforms, allowing users to trade digital⁢ assets⁢ such as digital bonds. ZKB has also actively participated in innovation in this field, participating in the world's first digital ⁤bond issuance project ⁤and⁤ cooperating with the Swiss National ⁣Bank to pilot the⁣ central bank digital⁤ currency (CBDC).

Switzerland's cryptocurrency ecosystem is no longer limited ⁤to its own country, and its innovative model and regulatory experience are being referenced and adopted by other countries around the world. For example, relevant⁢ regulatory agencies in the European Union⁣ and the United States are drawing on Switzerland's experience⁣ to develop⁢ their⁤ own cryptocurrency legal frameworks. ⁢Switzerland has become an⁤ important promoter and standard setter for global cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

In the future, Switzerland's further development ⁤in the field of cryptocurrency may involve more asset⁣ tokenization and innovative applications of cross-border payments. As a frontier country in⁤ financial innovation, ⁤Switzerland will continue to play its leading⁣ role in exploring the integration of cryptocurrency and traditional financial systems.

Switzerland ⁢is a leader ⁤in⁤ the regulation, innovation, and global influence ⁣of⁢ cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. This provides a solid foundation for traditional banks, including ZKB, ⁢to enter⁣ the cryptocurrency market, ⁤and also sets an example for the healthy development of the global⁢ cryptocurrency industry.",https://image.coinlive.com/cryptotwits-static/d76a46da6e434eae185bca78c0c70c5d.jpg,0.3254901960784313

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,350.86.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 124% and ETH is up 48% year over year.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to safely store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1764705882352942
Best Ethereum (ETH) Casinos and Gambling Sites | BitcoinChaser,https://bitcoinchaser.com/casino/crypto/ethereum/,2024-09-10,BitcoinChaser,"The Ethereum online casino industry is developing at an exponential rate and has started posing a serious threat to the bitcoin gambling industry. In many cases, cryptocurrency gambling sites have taken the opportunity to bridge the gap by offering Ethereum as a payment method for their most popular games. Ethereum gambling could well revolutionize the following aspects of the industry:

Later in the article, we'll get into more of the advantages of Ethereum gambling. First, it's a good idea to get to grips with what Ethereum actually means.

Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain is a publicly-viewed ledger containing all the transactions of its currency, in this case: Ether.

Ethereum was launched in 2015 and has since grown dramatically in both size and value.

What sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies is that its economy is based on smart contracts, onto which anybody can write any code. By allowing users to create and deploy smart contracts, control over transactions is totally democratized and accessible.

These smart contracts can be used for a wide range of purposes, including revolutionizing online gambling. In short, Ethereum gambling sites have all the advantages of Bitcoin online casinos, and more.

Included in our list of Ethereum casinos are:

This is the basic difference between Ethereum and Ether gambling. You can think of Ethereum as being about the gaming experience, and Ether as a potential currency of choice.

In other words, any Ethereum online casino could involve Ether gambling, but not all Ether gambling is based on Ethereum's smart contracts. In fact, Ethereum-based casinos may evolve to incorporate payment with other cryptocurrencies.

If you've read our article on crypto casinos, you'll know that gambling with currencies like Bitcoin has incomparable advantages for players. But what sets Ethereum apart from other Bitcoin casinos?

Transaction times on Ethereum are significantly shorter than on the Bitcoin network, which is a huge advantage. While Bitcoin casinos promise a transfer time of fewer than 10 minutes, Ethereum has a transfer time of an astonishing 16 seconds.

As a consequence, it is much cheaper to deposit and withdraw funds with Ethereum. In this way, smart contracts could potentially shift consumer behavior in the industry. Once players understand that an instant withdrawal can be coded into a contract, they are likely to demand it.

If you've played at cryptocurrency or Bitcoin casinos before, you've probably heard of Bitcoin games. Bitcoin games are special because they are based on the blockchain. Ethereum games are similar, but they have the added benefit of smart contracts.

It's almost impossible to come up with a complete list of Ethereum gambling possibilities because the network allows for an unprecedented degree of flexibility in terms of game programming through smart contracts.

Ethereum online casinos also make it possible for industry regulators to start playing a more proactive role. This takes a divergence from recent developments in the industry, which have seen more and more crypto casinos remaining unlicensed and unregulated. For example, authorities could actually offer best practices and advice on certain codes for every smart contract. In this way, regulation could become much easier and more individualized.

The Ethereum blockchain continuously re-invents and updates itself. The most recent Casper update, for instance, has introduced a Proof of Stake (PoS) system, which no longer requires all the nodes in the network to prove transactions. In other words, new developments in this fast-paced technology will keep making Ethereum gambling cheaper, faster, and smoother.

While there are plenty of casinos that have embraced Ethereum and/or Ether, there is also such a thing as a 'pure Ethereum casino'. These casinos offer games based on smart contracts and take payment in Ether. Clearly, the online casino industry is catching on to the diverse and innovative potential of Ethereum gambling.

In fact, one of the first pure Ethereum gambling initiatives, Edgeless, brought the 0% house edge model to online gambling. This is only one of the disruptive innovations that a pure Ethereum gambling initiative could come up with.

So, if Ethereum gambling has so many advantages, why isn't it more widespread? Smart contract casinos usually advertise using terms like 'fair' 'speed' and 'lower house edge'. While these are all convincing selling points, pretty much all online casinos use these buzzwords to advertise their site. As a consequence, the average online casino player might not notice anything special about Ethereum casinos.

For this reason, it's going to take 'organic education' and word-of-mouth for the market to really catch on to the advantages of smart contract Ethereum gambling. This is nothing unusual - even a technology as simple as email took a while to penetrate popular demand.

Maybe, in a couple of years, online casino players won't accept anything less than a casino with a smart contract in place.

Above, we've listed some of the most obvious advantages of Ethereum gambling, but it is not an exhaustive list. In fact, it's impossible to list all the ways that Ethereum could change the gambling scene because smart contracts enable infinite possibilities. The only limitation is your imagination. Why not be among the first to experience all the benefits of Ethereum online casinos?",https://bitcoinchaser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bitcoin-chaser.png,0.3725490196078431
How to Buy Waves (WAVES) * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-waves-waves,2024-09-09,Benzinga,"Wondering how to buy Waves and want to jump straight to the answer? You can buy WAVES today on Binance.US!

The Waves blockchain is an open-source platform for developers. It enables the creation of tokens and decentralized applications (dApps), similar to Ethereum. One of the key advantages of Waves is its simplicity. It does not require complicated smart contract technology, which is often needed for launching a cryptocurrency. This feature streamlines the process of token and platform development. The Waves network employs a combination of full nodes and light nodes. This structure supports the rapid creation of tokens and the development of decentralized applications.

If you're looking to diversify your cryptocurrency holdings, Waves may be a good option to do so. It competes with Ethereum but stands out in the blockchain sector. In this guide, Benzinga breaks down the step-by-step process on how to purchase WAVES easily and securely.

Follow these easy and simple steps to successfully purchase WAVES.

To buy any type of cryptocurrency, usually you open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that offers the token you're interested in. To create an account, you'll submit a bit of personal information which may include your email address, phone number, your full legal name and home address. You may also be required to submit a copy of your driver's license, military ID or passport for verification process.

After your account is open, you'll be able to transfer funds and make a deposit. Many trading platforms facilitate payments through credit card or debit card, wire transfer and cryptocurrency deposit sourced from other exchanges and wallets. Choose your preferred payment method, follow the instructions, enter the deposit amount, and confirm any transaction fees.

When your account is funded, you'll be able to place a buy order. Most crypto brokers offer access to multiple order types. The type of order that you place will determine how likely you are to see your order filled and the price you'll pay for each coin. Here's a look at two of the most common order types you'll likely have access to through your crypto broker.

After you place your order, your broker will fill it following your instructions. If your order is filled, you'll see your coins in your trading account.

WAVES is a blockchain platform that simplifies the creation and management of digital assets and decentralized applications. It was launched in 2016 by Sasha Ivanov. WAVES enables users to issue customized tokens for various purposes, such as fundraising through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and loyalty programs. The platform features a unique leasing mechanism. This allows users to lease their WAVES tokens to full nodes in exchange for rewards, promoting decentralization. WAVES is recognized for its user-friendly interface and robust smart contract capabilities. Its focus on scalability makes it attractive for developers. Additionally, WAVES facilitates easy conversion between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies through integrated exchange features.

As of writing, WAVES is trading for around $1.01 with a market capitalization of $117 million.

As crypto trading becomes more popular, there are now more options than ever to invest in both stablecoins and altcoins like Waves. Here are some of the best platforms where you can purchase WAVES.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a tool that gives you more control and protection when you store your tokens. There are two major types of crypto wallets: software and hardware wallets. A software wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that must be connected to the internet in order to access your tokens. A hardware wallet, on the other hand, stores your tokens offline on a physical device.

If you plan on holding onto your crypto for a significant amount of time, we recommend storing your tokens in an offline, cold storage wallet. If you don't already have a cryptocurrency wallet that's compatible with ERC-20 tokens like Waves, consider a few of our top choices below.

Ledger is among the most popular hardware wallets available and is best known for its high level of cold-storage security. It supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including ERC-20 tokens, Ethereum and Bitcoin. The device features Bluetooth compatibility for accessing decentralized applications and can be quickly connected to a smartphone using the Ledger Live app.

The Ellipal cold storage wallet supports over 7,000 tokens across 35 blockchains, making it highly compatible for storing multiple cryptocurrencies. It features a sleek design and a bright screen for easy management of holdings, with monthly updates adding new supported assets.

After your order is filled, you need to decide if you want to actively trade your Waves coins or if you want to hold them long-term. If you decide to hold long-term, we recommend moving your coins into your hardware wallet as soon as your order is filled. This ensures maximum security and greatly limits the chance of being involved in a hack.

If you decide to become an active trader, you'll capitalize on small price movements throughout the day and week instead of holding your coins long term. You may want to convert your Waves to a stablecoin (like Tether or USD). When the price of Waves rises, convert back to Waves when the price drops again.

The cryptocurrency market experiences significant volatility. Major cryptocurrencies can fluctuate by 6% up or down on a daily basis. Here's a quick look at how the crypto market is moving today.

Adding altcoins to your cryptocurrency portfolio can be an excellent way to introduce more diversification into your investment collection. However, remember that the cryptocurrency market is still widely unregulated. If you do decide to invest in Waves (or any other coin), never invest more money than you can comfortably afford to lose.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/16161721/waves.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.1607843137254903
10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for September 2024,https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-for-september-2024,2024-09-09,Benzinga,"Benzinga's top cryptocurrency picks for August include Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, which are available on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.

The cryptocurrency market has experienced remarkable growth throughout 2024, with a surge in institutional adoption, rising prices and increased confidence from investors. Key events such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and Ethereum ETFs in May have played a significant role in driving the market to unprecedented levels. Additionally, the Bitcoin halving and the rise of meme coins have added to the excitement and frenzy in the market.

Despite the strong performance of the cryptocurrency market year-to-date, many experts and analysts believe that there is still room for further growth in the remainder of the year and into 2025. With this in mind, it's essential for investors to stay informed and be strategic in their investment decisions. Let's look at some of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for August 2024.

The landscape of best cryptocurrencies evolves as the crypto market continually changes. However, here are some of the top tokens for August 2024.

Bitcoin has been the leader in the cryptocurrency sector, setting the stage for all other projects. Acting as a form of payment and a store of value, it has performed strongly in 2024, reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) and surpassing previous records set in 2021. Sentiment on Bitcoin remains predominantly bullish, with many anticipating the price rally will continue. In 2024, primary catalysts included approving spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the bitcoin halving in late April. ETFs have attracted new investors, while the halving is expected to decrease the daily token supply.

Ethereum is the most prominent blockchain, providing users access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It accommodates various projects, from AI startups to leading meme coins. Its robust development platform and easily usable innovative contract system make this possible. It is a versatile chain, allowing users to access all aspects of Web3 easily. The chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) system in 2022. In 2024, some significant events have been upgrades to the chain that increased speeds and lowered costs, as well as the approval of spot ETH ETFs, which could launch later this year.

Solana had a rough start in 2023 because Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX were some of the largest investors in the project. This resulted in the token losing over 96% of its value within 11 months of the FTX collapse. At the time, many thought that SOL was a dead project. However, 2023 and 2024 have seen a revival of the project. Many new tokens have started on Solana recently. These projects include staking protocols, storage, AI and many others. However, memecoins have been one of the driving forces behind Solana's comeback. These new tokens have skyrocketed in popularity, causing investors to buy and swap SOL for these new tokens.

Ripple is a centralized company hoping to bring crypto's possibilities to the banking sector. Its business model uses its native token, XRP, to facilitate transactions. Ripple can use the XRP token as an intermediary between other assets. For example, BTC and ETH are not directly interchangeable. However, Ripple can convert BTC to XRP and then convert the XRP into ETH. This concept can be applied to any currency swap or transaction a bank may have to make daily. XRP is particularly useful in this case because it is fast and has transaction fees that are a tiny fraction of a cent. If financial institutions start using XRP on a larger scale, the price could increase. Additionally, discussions of a spot XRP ETF have surfaced. If this were to happen, it could increase the token's price.

Dogecoin has been able to stick around in the top 20 tokens by market cap for some time and has gone up with the rest of the market in 2024. Additionally, new use cases in the future could send the token even higher. Elon Musk said he would consider allowing users to buy a Tesla car with DOGE, enabling people to buy Tesla merch with DOGE. If this were to happen, it could increase demand for the token and send the price higher. DOGE has also held its spot as the top meme coin in past bull and bear markets, performing particularly well in 2024.

Avalanche is a chain focused on high speeds and low costs. It hopes to make interacting with DeFi as straightforward and inexpensive as possible. The project saw relatively low volatility in 2023 but has performed exceptionally well in 2024. Its success has resulted from new projects making a home on the chain. Most of these projects revolve around crypto exchanges and trading. For example, one of the most popular protocols is Trader Joe, which allows users to trade, stake, yield farm and provide liquidity for a handful of Avalanche-based projects. If Avalanche can attract a more diverse range of projects, it could continue its upward momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

One of the defining characteristics of computing is exponential growth. Computers are becoming increasingly faster and take up less space, and advances in quantum computing could pose a risk to some of the larger blockchains. For instance, a quantum computer could overthrow the current mining system on bitcoin through a 51% attack, or the computer could bypass the current cryptographic protocols and access anyone's wallet address. While these may seem like distant threats, researchers already use quantum computing in various contexts. Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is looking to solve this issue by creating a new security protocol called the eXtended Merkle Tree Signature Scheme (XMSS). The blockchain is designed to resist quantum computing attacks, potentially allowing it to survive if other blockchains go down from quantum attacks.

SHIB is among the few meme coins that will survive the 2022 bear market. The project is a meme coin based on the Shiba Inu dog breed, akin to the DOGE meme. The project has spent several years building an ecosystem that gives the token utility beyond just a meme coin. For example, it has created NFT projects, a layer 2 blockchain called Shibarium, a separate token for staking rewards and a biweekly magazine. These new uses have helped the token survive the bear market and perform well in the current market. The token has sustained a strong community over the years, allowing it to cement itself as a meme coin worth the hype.

NEAR hopes to solve one of the most significant issues many see with Ethereum and other chains. These chains require vast computing power to operate and to provide services to their users. This requirement puts lots of strain on the chain, resulting in slow speeds and high costs. NEAR utilizes sharding and a novel consensus mechanism called Nightshade to improve speeds and scalability. Developers can benefit from others' projects, as everything on the platform is open source. These are optimal conditions for developers, as it is much easier to make faster applications. If NEAR can attract more projects that lead to more use cases, the price has room to keep increasing.

Binance Coin was hit in late 2023 when its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), was allegedly involved in money laundering charges. Many wondered if Binance could continue as a company, as the charges were severe. However, the dust has settled from the incident, and BNB has been on a solid upward trajectory in 2024. This is mainly driven by Binance's exchange listing new tokens, which makes the platform attractive to investors looking to stay ahead of the latest crypto trends and purchase the hottest tokens as soon as they are available. If Binance can continue to move forward from the scandal with CZ and bring in new users with interesting new tokens, there is room for the price to continue increasing.

Cryptocurrency is a token-based way of transacting online. Tokens are stored on an unchangeable ledger that anyone can view. The data is also stored on an extensive computer network, allowing for much easier scalability.

Most cryptocurrencies are processed by other users on the blockchain. These users can verify transactions in exchange for rewards, usually through staking (PoS) or mining (PoW).

Since the basic framework for technology has been developed by previous projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is easy for new developers to create a blockchain of their own. Projects like Ethereum allow users to create their tokens with little effort. Because of this, tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies are available to invest in.

To invest in crypto, you first have to create an account on a cryptocurrency trading platform. Some of the top firms are Coinbase, Kraken, Webull, and eToro. These sites are well known for their low fees, security, and ease of use.

To make an account, you can simply navigate to one of the trading platforms and enter an email and password to create your account. You will then have to provide documentation (e.g. passport, driver's license, etc.) to verify your account. Once your account is verified, you can link a bank account using various methods and fund the trading account.

Some platforms, such as Coinbase, only offer crypto trading. This can be beneficial for those looking to invest in crypto alone and niche tokens. However, other sites, such as Robinhood, allow stock and crypto trading on the same account, though they have fewer crypto offerings. This is just one of the many differences between platforms, so it is important to understand the pros and cons of each before investing.

The IRS treats cryptocurrency as a form of property. Because of this, you must pay capital gains tax on crypto sales. Crypto exchanges send Form 1099s, which report capital gains and losses for the year. You can use this form to report your taxes on crypto transactions.

The forms are in your account information and are easily accessible. Additionally, they are not too complicated and are easy to report when you file your taxes.

In January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a handful of spot ETFs to begin trading. These investment instruments allow equity investors to access a variety of underlying assets. They work by the sponsoring firm acquiring a pool of assets (in this case, Bitcoin) and then packaging them into shares, which are then distributed to investors. For the Bitcoin ETFs, the sponsors bought lots of Bitcoins and then packaged them into shares, which traders can buy and sell.

As of right now, only Bitcoin ETFs are trading. However, the SEC recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, which require more due diligence from the SEC before they can officially begin trading. However, some speculate that the ETH ETFs could start trading within a few months.

There are countless cryptocurrencies to invest in, and new tokens are created daily. While this can make it difficult to hone in on a specific token to buy, it can also mean many opportunities in the markets. However, it is essential to understand your own risk tolerance and investment objectives before investing. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, leading to large profits and significant losses.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/29162915/best-cryptocurrencies-768x512.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.4588235294117646
"Ethereum price today: ETH is trading at $2,315.67",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-09-2024/,2024-09-09,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,315.67, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum reached a 52-week intraday high of $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024, and a 52-week intraday low of $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has a global market capitalization of $278.62 billion. Year over year, ETH has increased 43%.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $278.62 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $75.61 billion, XRP at $53.13 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.28 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $278.62 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $307 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $299 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,315.67.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 43% year over year, compared to a 114% gain for bitcoin.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

A crypto lottery is a modern twist on traditional lotteries, allowing participants to buy tickets using cryptocurrency.

This type of lottery harnesses blockchain technology for transparency and security.

Winners are determined through random selection, similar to traditional lottery systems.

Unlike conventional lotteries, which often involve centralized organizations, crypto lotteries operate on decentralized platforms, making them accessible to a global audience.

This means that anyone with an internet connection and a digital wallet can participate, breaking down geographical barriers and democratizing the lottery experience.

In a crypto lottery, players purchase tickets with digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Each ticket has a unique identification associated with it on the blockchain.

The drawing occurs live, ensuring fairness by using cryptographic methods.

Many crypto lotteries incorporate smart contracts, which automatically execute the terms of the lottery without the need for intermediaries. This not only enhances trust among participants but also reduces the operational costs typically associated with running a lottery.

The use of blockchain technology allows for real-time tracking of ticket sales and prize distributions, providing participants with a level of transparency that is often lacking in traditional lottery systems.

One of the main attractions of crypto lotteries is the level of anonymity they provide. Players can participate without revealing personal information. This feature protects privacy and limits the risk of identity theft.

The use of blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and immutable, adding an extra layer of trust for participants.

Unlike traditional lotteries, where players may have to share sensitive data, crypto lotteries allow individuals to engage in gaming activities without the fear of their information being misused or sold to third parties. This aspect is particularly appealing to those who value their privacy in an increasingly digital world.

Crypto lotteries can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

There are no geographical restrictions, which means more people can participate.

This opens up the gaming opportunity to individuals in regions where traditional lotteries may not operate.

The ability to use cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange eliminates the need for currency conversion, making it easier for players from different countries to join in.

This democratization of access not only enhances the player base but also fosters a diverse community of lottery enthusiasts who can share experiences and strategies across borders. As a result, players can enjoy a richer gaming environment that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.

The operational costs for crypto lotteries are often lower than those of traditional lotteries.

As a result, players can enjoy higher payout percentages.

Lower fees mean more money goes back to participants instead of administration costs.

This financial efficiency is largely due to the reduced overhead associated with running a decentralized platform. Without the need for physical locations, staffing, and extensive regulatory compliance, crypto lotteries can allocate a greater portion of their revenue directly to winners.

Many crypto lotteries utilize smart contracts to automate payouts, ensuring that winnings are distributed quickly and transparently, further enhancing player trust and satisfaction.

This innovative approach not only benefits players but also encourages more frequent participation, as individuals are drawn to the prospect of better odds and greater rewards.

Before investing in any crypto lottery, it's crucial to check the site's reputation.

Look for reviews and feedback from other players to gauge their experiences.

A reliable platform often has a history of payouts and customer satisfaction.

Consider the longevity of the site in the market; established platforms tend to have a proven track record and a loyal user base. Engaging with community forums or social media groups dedicated to crypto lotteries can also provide insights into the site's credibility.

Players often share their success stories and warnings about potential scams, which can be invaluable in making an informed choice.

The security of your funds and personal information is paramount in online gaming.

Choose platforms that use strong encryption and secure wallets.

Investigation into the site's licensing and regulatory compliance also adds protection.

Look for two-factor authentication (2FA) options, which provide an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification before allowing access to your account.

Reputable sites often conduct regular security audits and provide transparency about their security protocols. Checking if they have a dedicated customer support team available to address any security concerns can also be a good indicator of their commitment to protecting users.

Every lottery site will have its own set of rules and regulations.

Make sure to read and understand them fully before purchasing tickets.

This can help avoid misunderstandings about the withdrawal process or payout structure.

Familiarize yourself with the specific terms regarding jackpot sizes, ticket prices, and any associated fees that may apply. Some platforms may offer different types of lotteries, each with unique rules, so understanding these nuances can enhance your gaming experience.

It's wise to keep an eye on any promotional offers or changes in regulations that could impact your participation, as these can vary significantly between sites and over time.

By taking all these factors into consideration, we were able to select the best crypto lotteries that provide a safe and enjoyable gambling experience for players.

To buy a ticket, start by selecting a reputable crypto lottery site. Look for platforms that are well-reviewed and have a transparent operation, ensuring your funds are secure.

Next, create an account and fund it with your chosen cryptocurrency. Most sites accept popular currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, but be sure to check the specific requirements of the platform you choose.

Navigate to the lottery section, select your numbers or a quick pick, and complete the purchase. Some platforms may offer additional features, such as the ability to buy tickets for multiple draws in advance or to set up recurring entries for your favorite lotteries. This can save you time and ensure you never miss a chance to win.

No lottery guarantees a win, but certain strategies can improve your odds. One effective method is to study past winning numbers, as some players believe that certain numbers appear more frequently than others. While this is not a foolproof strategy, it can add an element of fun to your number selection process.

Consider joining a syndicate to pool tickets and increase collective chances. This approach allows you to share the cost of multiple tickets with a group of friends or fellow players, significantly boosting your odds of winning without breaking the bank.

Regular participation can also help you recognize patterns, although lotteries are fundamentally random. Engaging with a community of lottery enthusiasts can provide insights and tips that you might not discover on your own, enhancing your overall experience in the crypto lottery world.

Crypto lottery sites represent the future of online lottery gaming, offering a blend of innovation, security, and accessibility.

By choosing one of the best crypto lottery platforms, you're not only embracing cutting-edge technology but also potentially enhancing your chances of winning.

Remember to consider factors such as game variety, token compatibility, user interface, and community feedback when selecting your preferred site.

As the crypto lottery landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and choosing reputable platforms will ensure you make the most of your digital lottery experience.

Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the world of crypto lotteries, these top sites provide exciting opportunities to test your luck in the digital age.

Crypto lottery sites operate similarly to traditional online lotteries but use cryptocurrencies for transactions. Players purchase tickets using supported cryptocurrencies, and draws are typically conducted using provably fair algorithms or blockchain-based random number generators. Winnings are distributed in cryptocurrency, often with faster payout times compared to traditional lotteries.

The accepted cryptocurrencies vary by platform, but most popular crypto lottery sites support Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Many also accept other major cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and various stablecoins. Some sites may even have their own native tokens for gameplay.

The legality of crypto lottery sites depends on your jurisdiction. Many operate in a legal grey area due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. It's essential to check your local laws and regulations regarding online gambling and cryptocurrency use before participating.

Reputable crypto lottery sites use provably fair algorithms or blockchain technology to ensure randomness and transparency. Look for sites that publicly display their algorithms, provide verifiable draw results, and have their systems audited by third-party organizations.

Crypto lottery sites often offer advantages such as increased privacy, faster payouts, lower fees, global accessibility, and potentially better odds. They also provide transparency through blockchain technology and may offer unique games not found in traditional lotteries.

To deposit, you typically need to transfer cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the site's designated address. Withdrawals usually involve requesting a payout to your crypto wallet address. The process is generally faster than traditional banking methods, often completing within minutes or hours.

While most crypto lottery sites don't charge fees for playing, you may incur transaction fees when depositing or withdrawing cryptocurrencies. These fees are typically lower than those associated with traditional payment methods.

Crypto lottery sites generally offer a higher degree of anonymity compared to traditional lotteries. Many only require an email address or username to create an account. However, some sites may require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for large withdrawals or to comply with regulations.

Crypto lottery sites often offer a variety of games beyond traditional number draws. These may include instant win games, scratch cards, slot-like games, and even lottery pools. Some sites also feature unique blockchain-based games that leverage smart contracts.

Jackpots on crypto lottery sites can be fixed amounts of cryptocurrency or progressive jackpots that grow with each ticket sold. Some sites offer massive jackpots comparable to traditional national lotteries, while others focus on smaller, more frequent wins.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Best-Bitcoin-Crypto-Lottery-Sites.jpg,0.4745098039215687
The U.S. Dollar's Resilience: Strength Or Illusion?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4719602-vaneck-crypto-monthly-recap-august-2024,2024-09-06,Seeking Alpha,"One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun.

By Matthew Sigel & Patrick Bush

In August, most crypto assets saw significant declines amid rising market volatility and a risk-off environment driven by macroeconomic factors such as the yen carry trade implosion.

Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below.

Most crypto assets fell sharply in August as fundamental usage and financial statistics slipped against the broader market backdrop of rising volatility. For the month of August, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 11%, Ethereum (ETH-USD) -24%, and Solana (SOL-USD) -21%, vs. the S&P +2% and the Nasdaq +1%. The market capitalization of all Smart Contract Platforms (SCP) ended August (-12%) lower than it closed in July.

Though the precipitating event for the dismal price performance was a risk-off typhoon spawned by the yen carry trade, general sentiment for crypto remained poor even after the event. The apex of the pandemonium was August 5, when BTC wicked as low as $49k while ETH crashed to $2.1k after opening the month at around $64.6k and $3.2k respectively. Though Bitcoin has regained some of its value since the ""flash crash,"" sitting around $ 58k at the time of writing, ETH is still wallowing around $2.5k. The impact of the yen carry trade implosion translated into BTC and ETH's August 30-day volatility climbing (+48%) and (+52%) higher than the previous month, as well as Bitcoin's 90-day correlation with the Nasdaq rising to an 18-month high of 38%.

Besides macro factors driving prices lower, blockchain usage deteriorated in August. For example, daily active usership was down (-10%) in August, fees generated fell (-12%), and DEX volumes sagged (-4%) compared to July. The German & US Governments also transferred 62k Bitcoin to exchanges, presumably for sale, while Mt. Gox and Gemini bankruptcy distributions totaled another 124k Bitcoin. That's $11B in non-repeatable sales, roughly equivalent to the net inflows to Bitcoin ETPs in the first two months of trading. Lastly, driving weak price action at month-end, the SEC sent a Wells Notice to OpenSea, one of the largest NFT exchanges, claiming that the company is an unregistered broker. The action is another sign that regulation by enforcement may continue in the US unless Donald Trump wins the election.

One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun. A very important DeFi ""primitive,"" WBTC, or ""Wrapped Bitcoin,"" is a token on Ethereum that is backed by Bitcoin custodied at the crypto exchange Bitgo. Someone who wishes to use mint WBTC can send their Bitcoin to Bitgo, which then issues the WBTC on Ethereum. WBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, held by Bitgo, which provides attestations of holdings.

At the time of writing, more than 153k BTC worth $9.2B have been ""wrapped"" into WBTC for use in Ethereum's DeFi. As part of the new partnership agreement, Bitgo will move custody of WBTC outside of the United States to three different Asian countries. The crypto community reacted negatively to these developments due to the negative perception of Justin Sun and past issues with other projects brought under his aegis, like USDD and TrueUSD. MakerDAO, the entity that runs the permissionless crypto-backed stablecoin DAI, passed a governance proposal banning wBTC as used for collateral to create DAI. To seize the initiative, Coinbase announced its own wrapped version of BTC called wbBTC. At the same time, Bitcoin L2 Babylon unexpectedly declared the launch of their mainnet the week after Bitgo's new custody announcement. Meanwhile, existing competitors such as tBTC and BTC.b saw modest inflows of 250 BTC and 50 BTC.

Daily Memecoin Volumes on Solana Fall Back to 2023 Levels

Source: Dune @ally as of 8/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Click to enlarge

Solana (-21%) has had a mixed month as several underlying issues surfaced to generate a minor FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) cycle. Speculation is the lifeblood of crypto, and no more is this a reality than on Solana, which accounts for ~22% of all DEX trading, of which 47% has been memecoin trading since June 1, 2024. It is apparent to many in the crypto community that Solana memecoin trading is rife with fraudulent activity. A coin supposedly associated with Donald Trump was ""rugged"" for $2M, someone hacked McDonald's Instagram account to announce a memecoin that eventually scammed buyers out of $700k, while other tokens with liquidities of <$100k are seeing daily trading volumes >$10M. The result has been that many traders on Solana have lost money due to memecoins. It is estimated that only 0.76% of wallets on Solana's top memecoin platform, pump.fun, are profitable.

Many small traders are catching on to the fact that memecoin trading is usually a zero-sum game. This change in sentiment has driven memecoin trading down (-43%) month-to-month while total DEX volume on Solana is down (-48%). As a result, Solana's monthly fees have declined (35%). On the positive front for Solana, the first (and second) spot SOL ETF debuted in Brazil, while the interesting DePIN project Grass announced its token airdrop, and the perpetual futures platform Drift launched a prediction market. The stablecoin of PayPal, PYUSD, reached $664M in supply on Solana, nearly double the $345M of PYUSD on Ethereum. In August, the total supply of all stablecoins on Solana reached $3.9B, 160% greater than a year earlier.

A budding challenge for the widespread adoption of Solana is its blockchain's massive size in computer storage space. Solana is designed to process tens of thousands of transactions per second and has consistently demonstrated this capability. Blockchain transactions are essentially ""writes"" to each blockchain's database of information. The more transactions, the more ""writes"" occur, and this causes more data to be stored on a blockchain. While Bitcoin's blocks are around 1.6MB in size and occur every 10 minutes, Solana blocks can be as large as 128MB, and these blocks occur around every half second. The result is that the Bitcoin blockchain is around 550 GB in size for 15 years of history, while Solana's chain is around 150TB (272x bigger) for roughly 4.5 years of history.

This is an issue because it makes it very difficult and expensive for people to store its history and query its contents. Looking at past events or simple things like an account's historical balances is cost-prohibitive. Solana expects private entities to spin up to provide services for those wishing to comb Solana's history. Allium, an S-tier data services provider, is one of the few entities that can effectively assess Solana's history. This presents a challenge to anyone who wants to create assets on Solana.

If an audit is to occur or an issue crops up, someone has to spend large sums of money to untangle Solana's historical archive. The instability of Solana's consensus mechanism and its history of outages add to the challenges posed by Solana's substantial history. Because of these two issues, it is nearly impossible to prove that Solana's chain has operated without any faults (double spending of currency) and without sifting through the entire chain. Though this is a challenge with any blockchain, Solana's massive data output creates novel difficulties that are not posed by lower throughput chains. It must also be noted that while history is challenging to verify by new nodes, real-time verification of chain functionality can be verified by anyone with a full node. Newer high-throughput blockchains, such as Aptos and Sui, have different design philosophies that seek to address these challenges. But realistically, Solana's big data limitations will likely plague other high-capacity blockchains.

Hosted on the Polygon blockchain, Polymarket has crept into the news cycle during the US presidential election season as an exciting use case of crypto technology. Polymarket is a permissionless prediction market that allows users to create betting markets and speculate on the outcome of off-chain events in politics, sports, finance, and popular culture. The smart contracts that power Polymarket are hosted on the Polygon blockchain. These smart contracts receive, interpret, and execute better payoffs using data brought on the chain by the crypto ""oracle"" Uma. The pseudo-anonymous nature of Polymarket combined with its limitless, global accessibility allows it to incorporate valuable information more efficiently and dynamically than is possible outside of crypto. Because people can create any market with any type of outcome without a central party to prevent the flow of information by limiting markets or betting, Polymarket is arguably a more accurate prediction engine than any web2 betting platform. While web2 companies can be pressured to censor or alter markets, Polymarket's decentralized system prevents outside parties from stopping the incentivized transfer of knowledge that prediction markets enable.

The recent attention on Polymarket has focused on its political prediction markets, such as the winner of the US presidential election or the winners of key US congressional races. Polymarket is generating enormous controversy with detractors contending that public opinion can be swayed by large-pocketed investors who manipulate prediction markets. Regardless, Polymarket usage has surged, with over $440M in wagers placed by over 60k monthly active traders in August. Recently, its data feeds have been integrated into Bloomberg terminals worldwide. Despite its popularity, Polymarket has only generated $17.9k in fees for the Polygon blockchain where it is hosted.

In stablecoin news, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin USDT, has shelved plans to launch its blockchain, citing market saturation. Another interesting development is that Maker, the entity behind the collateral-backed stablecoin DAI, has decided to rebrand to SKY. As part of its move, Maker will upgrade its DAI token to USDS and change its governance token, MAKER, to SKY. Users can choose to upgrade their existing DAI or MAKER tokens to receive token rewards and the Sky Savings Rate, which will only be available in certain jurisdictions. As part of the sweeping changes Maker calls its ""Endgame,"" Maker will allow independent entities called Stars to launch innovative stablecoins. Meanwhile, Circle, the creator of USDC, has launched the Euro-backed stablecoin EURC on Base.

Meanwhile, the VanEck-backed Agora stablecoin1 has proven to be one of the fastest-growing stablecoins in crypto. Since its launch on August 19, it has grown to $57.5M on Avalanche and Ethereum. Agora intends to grow rapidly by expanding its presence to other chains such as Sui. This would make Agora the first fiat-backed stablecoin on Sui. Agora's strategy is to grow through revenue-sharing agreements and distribution partnerships. Some target partnerships include protocols, on-chain applications, centralized exchanges, and other important entities in crypto. Nick Van Eck, founder of Agora, believes that stablecoins will become a $10T asset class expanding to enterprises issuing their own stablecoins. For more on stablecoins, please look out for our upcoming research piece on the topic.

Breaking Down Ethereum's Struggles

One of the most confounding topics has been the consistent underperformance of ETH since the beginning of the bull market in crypto assets in November 2023. Of the 22 major L1 projects that we track, Ethereum ranks 13th with a yearly return of 62%. While this absolute return is spectacular, this is less than ½ of BTC's 138% return, and far below Solana's astounding 624% return over the same period of time. During periods of crypto price pullbacks, Ethereum has also underperformed. For example, over the past 90 days, ETH (-30%) ranks 12th place among the group of 22 and has been outshined by competitors such as BNB (-5%), Tron's TRX (+37%) and TON (-3%). More recently, over the past 30 days, ETH has been an abysmal (-23%), which ranks it 19th among the 22 layer 1 blockchains we track.

ETH is the 18th Worst Performing Asset Over the Last 30 Days

We attribute ETH's dismal performance to the following factors:

Decline in revenues Speculation moving to high throughput blockchains L2 blockchains cannibalize Ethereum's revenue items like transaction fees and MEV Deliberate policy choices Ethereum has reduced fees for its L2 customers Ethereum relies upon L2s Value Extraction by Service EntitiesL2s, data availability blockchains, staking, and re-staking take away Ethereum's value

Without question, the best use case for public blockchains at this early stage is speculation. The current monetization of SCPs relies on people moving assets or trading them on-chain. This generates revenue for blockchains through transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), ultimately bringing value to tokenholders. Without speculation driving on-chain revenues, a blockchain must bank its worth on uncertain long-term potential.

Ethereum's Decline in the Face of Faster Competitors

Ethereum was once the epicenter of crypto speculation because it was the first smart contract platform to attract novel projects and allow users to speculate upon their tokens. However, the competitive landscape has changed, with more capable blockchains eating into Ethereum's once-dominant position.

These chains apply advancements in distributed systems technology to handle more transaction throughput and faster transaction processing. While Ethereum can process ~15 TPS per second with transaction confirmation times measured in minutes, chains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos can process thousands per second with confirmation latency measured in seconds. Simultaneously, the new crop of blockchains has figured out how to parallelize transactions that can be processed alongside each other. This allows transactions unrelated to congested areas on the blockchain to execute their logic unencumbered. Ethereum only allows transactions to process sequentially, and if one part of Ethereum is bombarded with demand, transactions on other parts are held in queue. As a result, the user experience for Ethereum's traders is clunky, and the number of individuals who can utilize Ethereum is limited.

Because of Ethereum's bottlenecks, developers building novel applications are increasingly deploying their projects to chains that can accommodate a better user experience and more users. These projects are also deploying their tokens to these new chains. Many innovative, non-financial crypto projects, like Helium and Hivemapper, reside on more advanced blockchains. Slowly, Ethereum is not only losing its dominance as a place to speculate, but it is also losing the tokens that appeal to speculators.

Ethereum's Diminishing Fee Revenues

Quantifying Ethereum's loss of its pole position among blockchains, since 2022, the share of all blockchain fees received by Ethereum has fallen from 86% to 33%, while its share of DEX volume has declined from 42% to 29%.

Ethereum's Shift to Layer-2: A Double-Edged Sword?

Ethereum's solution to improve its scalability, pushing transactions to L2 blockchains, has thus far failed to drive value to ETH. Not only do the L2 blockchains increasingly cut into Ethereum economics through multiple pathways, but they also offer a suboptimal user experience while still offering far less transaction throughput than Ethereum competitors.

On the first dimension, value accrual to ETH, pushing transactions to its orbiting blockchains, also moves revenue-generating components like MEV and transaction fees to those L2 chains. Though L2s remit value to Ethereum by posting proofs and batches of transactions, Ethereum's share of transaction fees in its ecosystem (Ethereum + L2s) alone has dropped from 98% to 89% since 2022. MEV is difficult to calculate but can be approximated as a portion of DEX volumes. At the start of 2023, Ethereum commanded 90% of DEX volumes in its ecosystem, whereas today, that share is around 52%. The MEV that is generated by these DEX volumes accrues to the L2s instead of Ethereum.

The shift to L2s has also expanded the amount of available Ethereum blockspace, which has lowered the price of transactions. To make transactions even less costly, Ethereum passed EIP-4844, which created a new data processing lane for batches of L2 transactions. This has reduced revenues for both Ethereum and its L2s. At the start of 2024, Ethereum collected ~$6M; in August, that figure was $1.2M. The pie has shrunk at the behest of Ethereum, lowering its blockspace pricing, and because of Layer-2s. Ethereum's share of that pie has also diminished. Compared to 180 days ago, the 7 Day Moving Average of Ethereum's fees is down (-89%)! By comparison, Bitcoin's fees have sagged (-13%) while Tron's and Solana's are up (+125%) and (+114%). This lack of fee generation has bled into Ethereum, becoming an inflationary economic system, with inflation now sitting at 0.74% and 944K of yearly issuance worth $2.45B in new supply.

New Tokens and Competitors: Ethereum's Growing Challenges

At the same time, many tokens have been launched that currently, or in the future, cleave value from Ethereum's ecosystem. These include L2, Data availability, re-staking, and staking tokens. Each of these product groups offers a competing service to Ethereum. Influential investors holding billions of dollars worth of tokens will demand that these projects cut into Ethereum's core businesses. Many of these projects have yet to launch a token, but we can estimate the value they have subtracted from Ethereum by looking at the collective FDV of their tokens. The twelve who have launched or have pre-markets for their tokens' values have captured roughly 11% of Ethereum's ecosystem value. As more projects launch tokens, there will be further competition in Ethereum's service set, driving the price of Ethereum's core services lower while offering competing investment opportunities. This pricing pressure may shrink the economic pie available to ETH holders while increasing competition for investor interest.

ETH's Share of Ethereum Ecosystem Services Token Value Has Decreased from 97% to 89% since Jan 2023

Among Ethereum L2s, Polygon and Optimism stood out this month for significant increases in developer activity, with their contracts per deployer 30-day moving averages up ~7.9x and ~4.8x, respectively. However, MATIC & OP tokens performed in the middle of the pack, down (-15%) and (-14 %), respectively. Polygon PoS developers are likely busy deploying contracts in preparation for the PIP-19 component of the broader Polygon 2.0 rollout, scheduled for September 4th. This upgrade will transition Polygon's native MATIC token to the ecosystem's next-generation POL token, which is designed to accommodate an array of ZK-based L2 chains with community staking and governance. POL is optimized for the development of the aggregated Polygon network (""AggLayer""). This network aims to be a unique scaling solution, moving beyond the current binary competition between modular and monolithic blockchain thesis dominated by Ethereum and Solana.

Polygon & Optimism Dev Outputs Surge Ahead of Upgrades

Optimism developers increased their output this month due to two main catalysts: addressing recently discovered fraud proof vulnerabilities and preparing for interoperability upgrades ahead of OP Labs' Superchain upgrade in early 2025. The Granite Network Upgrade proposal, made in response to third-party audits identifying security issues in Optimism's fault proof, includes both security and performance enhancements. The proposal passed on August 28th and is scheduled for execution on September 10th.

More proactively, Optimism announced its 'Superchain' roadmap this month, a three-milestone plan to bring interoperability to the OP Stack. According to L2Beat, nine of the top 20 Ethereum L2s are built using Optimism's OP Stack codebase. If successful, this roadmap could significantly reduce the liquidity and user fragmentation currently affecting the Ethereum L2 ecosystem. Bringing interoperability to the OP Stack could elevate its user experience to be comparable with high-performance L1s like Solana while retaining the security, applications, and user base of the Ethereum ecosystem. Adding to the Superchain's gravity, Sony Group announced the development of its own Ethereum L2, 'Soneium' that will be built using the OP Stack for both general Sony Group ecosystem applications. Additionally, Soneium will allow the exploration of new purposes, including ""...the protection of rights to creativity created by creators, new mechanisms for returning profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds."" Notably, the Japanese Prime Minister will speak at a Web3 Event in Tokyo later this year.

Arbitrum's native ARB token underperformed this month, down (-23%), with the L2 blockchain showing no meaningful increase in average developer output or total developer count. Earlier in the month, Arbitrum's DAO proposed and approved the development of an ARB staking mechanism, which plans to stream DAO-generated rewards from the L2's sequencer along with MEV, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification rewards to eligible token holders who are delegated to active governance participants.

Alongside Uniswap's UNI token, ARB was also added to the custodial business of the controversial Special Purpose Broker-Dealer, Prometheus Capital. Contrary to more nuanced takes from many crypto industry participants, Prometheum is aligned with the SEC's stance that traditional securities laws provide clear guidance on digital assets transactions. Given Uniswap's embattlement with the SEC, one could view ARB's addition to Prometheum as a bullish catalyst in terms of institutional distribution and liquidity or as a bearish catalyst in terms of exposure to the SEC. In either case, ARB appeared to lag other L2s in organic growth this month.

Base Has ~10x More Contract Deployers Than Other Top L2s

Coinbase's Base blockchain is the largest Ethereum L2 by daily active addresses. Base also boasts a substantial number of smart contract deployers. Data from Artemis.xyz shows that Base has nearly an order of magnitude more addresses deploying smart contracts on its L2 than Arbitrum, Blast, OP Mainnet, or Polygon PoS combined. Like other entrepreneurs, crypto developers must strategically anticipate where their customers will be. We think developers they are increasingly choosing to build on Coinbase's Base because it enjoys a key competitive moat: a direct-to-consumer onramp from its dominant centralized exchange.

In an increasingly fragmented L2 landscape, Coinbase's unique nexus of onchain and offchain users, developers, and liquidity offers compelling virtual real estate for building a crypto business. As Base is also part of the OP Stack, it participates in the Superchain's revenue sharing model. According to the 'Superchain Health Dashboard', Base contributed an estimated 142.45 ETH (~$367k) month-to-date to the Superchain Collective as of August 29th, second only to OP Mainnet itself. Base and Optimism thus present an interesting synergy, with Optimism potentially playing the long-term role of a relatively decentralized modular scaling solution counterpart to Coinbase's more centralized, retail-centric strategy.

August's Notable Performer - Tron (+20%)

Tron's Stablecoin Market Cap Outpaces Other Leading L1s

Up (+20%), Tron's native TRX token stood out once again this month, reaching levels not seen since April 2021. The blockchain's significant performance may largely be attributed to the mid-August launch of the Sun Pump platform Beta - a platform modeled after Solana's infamous pump.fun and named after Tron's founder Justin Sun. Sun Pump is a streamlined tool to launch meme coins in seconds. As of August 28th, Sun Pump has already launched over 56,000 meme coins on Tron, generating over 23 million TRX in revenue for an estimated $3.64 million USD. Effective August 25th, Tron executed Proposal #92 to increase the blockchain's energy cap, lowering gas fees and increasing transaction throughput in response to the increased user activity.

Sun Pump's initial success marks a significant diversification in Tron's adoption drivers, which historically have been centered around stablecoin investments and transfers in the APAC region and emerging economies. Data from Artemis, visualized in the chart above, illustrates the disproportionate amount of stablecoin value issued to the Tron blockchain relative to other leading smart contract blockchains. Indeed, while other blockchains experienced sizable drawdowns in stablecoin market caps during the bear market, Tron's blockchain demonstrated more sustained USD stablecoin retention and growth, even surpassing Ethereum as the blockchain with the most circulating Tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market cap.

However, Tron was not without headwinds or controversy this month. After the Tron DAO Reserve removed ~$732 million of Bitcoin backing the USDD stablecoin (purportedly without community vote), Justin Sun tweeted to assuage concerns, stating, ""The TRON DAO Reserve plans to spend time upgrading USDD in the future to make it a more competitive decentralized stablecoin in the market"", after lamenting that ""...the capital utilization [of USDD's reserves] is not very efficient.""

We maintain a positive view of Tron's retail market penetration as a stablecoin-centric network. However, we hold a highly cautious view of the ecosystem's exposure to Justin Sun's control, given his questionable past actions with USDD and other projects. Bluechip, a third-party stablecoin ratings agency, estimated that USDD's 53% collateralization was comprised of 69% TRX, 29% BTC, and 2% TUSD -- before the latest BTC withdrawal. USDD was initially inspired to compete with the now-collapsed UST stablecoin involved in Terra/LUNA, and we fear it risks suffering a similar fate due to its reliance on TRX for collateral. We are also concerned about the general challenges facing USDT holders who want to off-ramp their tokens to fiat. USDT can be redeemed for dollars by only a few entities, and many holders are supposed have to swap for USDC to offramp their USDT. Additionally, moving USDT from Tron to Ethereum is nearly impossible, adding to our concern of collusion between Sun and Tether to block exits for Tron's USDT holders.

August's Notable Laggard - zkSync (-24.05%)

zkSync User Growth Lags Base, Arbitrum, and Others as Ethereum L2 Ecosystem Activity Bounces

zkSync's native ZK token experienced a significant decline of (-24%) this month, driven partly by its underperforming user growth compared to other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. As the chart above illustrates, the growth of zkSync's daily active addresses -- a proxy for users -- lags that of Base, Arbitrum, and other leading L2s, even as overall activity in the Ethereum L2 ecosystem rebounds. Absent a clear negative catalyst. However, zkSync's stagnation can primarily be attributed to the vacuum left by the absence of its previous driver: airdrop farming.

Previously, zkSync fueled speculation about a potential airdrop, prompting users to interact with its network to increase their potential eligibility. For instance, a September 2023 zkSync blog post mentioned plans to ""fully decentralize the protocol's technology, community governance...,"" and emphasized ""empowering the community with ownership."" On June 11th, zkSync finally revealed details about the airdrop of its native ZK token. However, the distribution was criticized for lacking sybil resistance, a vulnerability in which a single entity can use multiple accounts to gain disproportionate amounts of airdropped tokens. After ZK token claims began the following week, one user claimed to have received over 6.6 million tokens across 350 Sybil wallets, valued at nearly $1.2 million. Simultaneously, many good-faith users found themselves ineligible for the airdrop, rubbing salt in the wounds of loyal community members and highlighting the inefficacy of zkSync's approach to ""fair"" ZK token distributions.

The combined effects of the resulting negative sentiment, lack of ongoing user incentives, and 83% overhanging ZK supply contribute to selling pressure. Moreover, the Ethereum L2 competitive landscape remains fierce, with L2s like Base gaining traction with the development of features like on-chain verification-enabled applications. It is logical that growth driven by organic demand for on-chain applications and more direct-to-consumer distribution such as Coinbase's is more sustainable than the airdrop hype that may have driven much of zkSync's initial growth.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, was $2,389.66 as of 8 a.m. ET. The crypto's highest intraday price in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $285.58 billion. ETH is currently up 47% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $285.58 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 71% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $76.11 billion, XRP at $53.84 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.14 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $285.58 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $303 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,389.66.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 118% and ETH is up 47% year over year.

How to buy ethereum

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to safely store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.09019607843137245

Day trading in crypto involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies within the same day to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations. The goal is to profit from these daily market movements. Strategies for crypto day trading are diverse, ranging from monitoring daily news to applying technical analysis.

However, traders should have at least an intermediate level of proficiency in crypto day trading. Proven strategies that work well for others might not yield the same results for you, so it's essential to choose a strategy that aligns with your specific goals. Additionally, a solid understanding of risk management is vital for success.

Brief Introduction to Day Trading

Day trading involves opening and closing positions within the same trading day. Strategies like scalping, where positions are held for short periods, are common. Unlike the stock market, the crypto market doesn't require positions to be closed by the end of the day, and hence, you cannot be considered a ""pattern day trader.""

Since the crypto market operates 24/7, traders can hold positions overnight to target higher profits or wait for a limit order to execute. The higher volatility of crypto assets makes them particularly well-suited for day trading, allowing traders to capitalize on short-term price movements. Day traders often rely heavily on technical indicators and closely monitor market sentiment, more so than swing traders.

Best Crypto Coins for Day Trading

For traders seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities, choosing highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin can be advantageous. However, for those who prefer a more conservative approach, blue-chip coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are typically better choices. The following can be considered as the best cryptocurrencies for day trading:

1. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, remains a top choice for many day traders. With its large trading volumes, high liquidity, and well-established market, Bitcoin offers numerous opportunities to profit from short-term price movements.

Additionally, the widespread availability of Bitcoin trading pairs on crypto exchanges makes it an attractive option for day traders.

How to Pick the Best Cryptos for Day Trading

While the crypto market seems very attractive for day trading, given the vast selection of assets, there are certain aspects that must be kept in mind before day trading cryptocurrencies.

1. Volatility

Day traders look for significant short-term price fluctuations to maximize profit opportunities, making cryptocurrencies with higher volatility more desirable for their strategies. Although most cryptocurrencies display varying levels of volatility, understanding key fundamentals -- such as market capitalization -- is crucial. Smaller market cap tokens often experience more dramatic swings compared to their larger counterparts.

2. Trading Volume

Larger trading volumes define healthier market conditions and more predictable price swings that tend to follow a logic of technical analysis.

3. Liquidity

Day traders must pick crypto assets that can be easily sold for fiat, stablecoins or any other coins. High-liquid cryptos allow faster execution of trades.

4. Market Depth

A deeper market indicates a more liquid and active market. It allows larger trade sizes without significantly affecting the slippage risks and the prices.

5. Utility

When day trading, the utility of a cryptocurrency can be an important consideration. Cryptocurrencies with specific, targeted use cases may exhibit lower correlation with broader market trends. For instance, Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi sector and Polkadot's focus on interoperability highlight how distinct functionalities can influence price behavior and create unique trading opportunities.

Conclusion

Selecting the right asset is crucial for success in day trading. While we've highlighted some top choices, it's essential to monitor market trends, conduct thorough research, and stay informed about the latest news and developments.

Day trading carries inherent risks, so effective risk management is key to trading responsibly.

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,389.66.

This collateralization is intended to ensure that for every USDC in circulation, there is a corresponding U.S. dollar or equivalent value held in reserve, providing a level of safety and transparency for users.

Learn how to buy USD Coin (USDC) now.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy USDC safely and easily.

To purchase USD Coin, you must first open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that supports USDC trading. Visit the platform's website or download the mobile app. Search for the ""Sign Up"" or ""Register"" button and click it. You will need to enter your email address and create a password. After setting up your account, verify your identity. This process usually requires submitting personal information and documents, including a government-issued ID and proof of address, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Know Your Consumer (KYC) regulations.

You can fund your account in various ways depending on the platform. Credit card, bank transfer, or existing cryptocurrency wallets are commonly accepted. Many trading platforms allow users to link their bank accounts for direct deposits or wire transfers. Alternatively, users can use credit card or debit card, though this may result in higher fees.

To make cryptocurrency deposits, please generate a wallet address from your exchange. Copy this address and transfer your funds from your personal crypto wallet. It is essential to verify both the address and the amount prior to confirming the transaction to ensure the security of your funds.

There are several uses for USD Coin. Visa recently announced its plans to settle transactions in USDC on Ethereum's blockchain, which is huge news for Ethereum's network becoming more practical.

Today the most common use case for USDC is to hedge against volatility in the crypto market without leaving the crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins can also interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) programs and earn interest. Since USDC uses Ethereum's network, the stablecoin can be used on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, yearn.finance and SushiSwap - something fiat cannot do.

These decentralized applications (dApps) allow investors to earn interest, take out loans and even settle insurance claims directly on the blockchain. Being able to do so with a cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar eliminates the risk associated with volatile cryptocurrencies, allowing risk-tolerant investors to stake USDC for interest rates north of 10%.

USDC was created by Centre Consortium, a joint venture between Coinbase and Circle - aimed at increasing mainstream adoption of fiat stablecoins. USDC operates by minting new coins when a user buys them with the USD from an exchange like Coinbase. Centre Consortium then puts this cash into its reserve, ensuring that $1 of USDC can be exchanged for $1 at any time.

Created in 2018, USDC's market capitalization has risen from around $200 million to more than $34 billion as of September 2024. While the price of USDC doesn't fluctuate more than a percentage point in either direction, the number of USDC has increased significantly.

USD Coin is U.S-based and completely audited by a third party. Unlike Tether (USDT), there's no question that USDC has each and every token backed by $1 of collateral in its reserves. It should be noted that this collateral does not have to be in the form of US Dollars, certain other types of debt are deemed valid by regulators. With increased skepticism about Tether's USDT backing, USDC may be a more secure alternative.

USDC is available for purchase on well-known trading platforms including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, Crypto.com and Gemini.

If you already own crypto, you can buy USDC with Ether tokens on a decentralized exchange. You'll need a compatible Ethereum wallet -- MetaMask is the best option for Uniswap because it has an easy-to-use Google Chrome extension. After sending your Ether tokens to MetaMask, you can swap them for USDC on Uniswap.org.

Now that you know how to buy USDC you need to learn how to store it safely. You should avoid storing your cryptocurrency, including USDC, on centralized exchanges due to the risk of hacking. Instead, it's safer to use dedicated cryptocurrency wallets, which provide public and private keys to secure your funds. Software wallets operate through a program, while hardware wallets are physical devices that keep your crypto offline. Here are a few of the best crypto wallets on the market.

Ledger is a trusted hardware wallet brand among many cryptocurrency investors. The company has been selling cryptocurrency wallets since 2014, and their wallets have never been hacked. The Ledger Nano S is a multicurrency wallet, so you can store all your cryptocurrencies in one place.

Coinbase has a dedicated wallet application that's great for storing your cryptocurrency. You can store Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC and several other assets on the wallet's mobile app. Coinbase Wallet is free to download, so the only cost to you will be transaction fees to send your crypto to your wallet on the blockchain.

Trading and converting your USDC is much easier than onboarding actual U.S dollars into the cryptocurrency market. Since USDC operates on Ethereum, you can swap between USDC and any Ethereum-based token on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Sushiswap. If you use a DEX, beware of high gas fees -- due to high demand for network space.

You also can use USDC on exchanges to easily convert to other cryptocurrencies without needing to access funds from your bank account. This is a better option for most retail investors, as there are much lower fees, however, USDT is a much more common in crypto/stablecoin trading pairs.

To get an idea of where the cryptocurrency market is headed, watch the price movements of major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

For most cryptocurrency traders, it makes sense to use USDC instead of USD. It's much easier to transfer to decentralized finance protocols, as it's tokenized on the same blockchain as Ethereum.

There are plenty of opportunities to earn interest with USDC that don't exist in traditional markets, as blockchain innovations cut out the banks that capitalize on your assets. So yes, USDC is better than USD in almost every way.

Investing in USD Coin (USDC) can be worth it for those seeking to engage in the cryptocurrency ecosystem while maintaining a stable value linked to the US dollar. As a stablecoin, USDC aims to provide the benefits of cryptocurrency transactions -- such as fast transfers and lower fees -- without the high volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes it attractive for individuals looking to protect their capital amidst market fluctuations. However, potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider the risks associated with digital currencies, including regulatory changes and technological challenges, before making a decision.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17130614/9d67b728b6c8f457717154b3a35f9ddc702eae7e76c4684ee39302c4d7fd0bb8.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.3411764705882352

As demand for decentralized applications increases, Aragon's tools are essential for simplifying governance and securing asset management, making it a key player in the development of decentralized finance and innovative economic models.

Our guide for beginners will help you learn a little more about the Aragon Network and how to invest in its token ANT.

Ready to dive in? Let's explore how to purchase ANT and unlock its potential within your investment portfolio!

The easiest way to purchase Aragon's token is to open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that supports Aragon trading. To create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, visit the website or app, click ""Sign Up,"" and provide your email and password. You'll need to verify your identity with personal information and documents.

Depending on where you've opened an account, you may be able to fund your account with a credit card, bank transfer or with an existing cryptocurrency wallet. Many platforms enable users to link their bank accounts for direct deposits or wire transfers. This makes transferring fiat currency such as USD or EUR straightforward. Alternatively, users can fund their accounts using credit cards or debit cards. However, this method may incur higher fees. Follow the instructions for your selected payment method. Enter the amount and confirm any transaction fees.

For cryptocurrency deposits, generate a wallet address from the exchange. Copy this address and send your funds from your personal crypto wallet. Always verify the address and amount before confirming the transaction to prevent any loss of funds.

After your account has been fully opened and funded, it's time to place your order to buy ANT. Take a look at the current market price and select an entry point that fits your funding and budget. The cryptocurrency market is always open and operating, which means that prices can change on a minute-to-minute basis. After deciding how many ANT tokens you're interested in purchasing, place a buy order. The type of buy order that you place will affect the price that you pay per token, and there are multiple types of buy orders that you can use. From here, your broker will carry out the order according to your specifications. If your broker is able to fill your order, you'll see your tokens in your exchange wallet.

Aragon is a decentralized application (dApp) that runs on the Ethereum network and allows users to create and manage their own decentralized organization.

The Aragon Network has a governance token called ANT, which trades on major cryptocurrency exchanges. ANT is an ERC-20 token, which means that holders can store their tokens using almost any wallet that's compliant with Ethereum.

Alternatively, you can purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum on trusted trading platforms, transfer it to a crypto exchange, then swap it for ANT. Check out our recommended cryptocurrency brokers to begin your journey.

If you don't plan on actively trading your ANT, it's a good idea to store your tokens outside of your exchange wallet. Storing your tokens in a private wallet helps keep your investments safer by ensuring that your account won't be targeted in the event that your brokerage is hacked. Private wallets provide you with a personal set of keys that only you can access, which helps keep your investment safer. There are two major types of cryptocurrency wallets: hardware and software wallets: Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your crypto in offline storage. Software wallets are computer or phone programs that store your tokens using private online storage.

ANT is an ERC-20 token, which means it runs on the Ethereum network. This also means that you'll have plenty of options when it comes to selecting how you want to store your investment. Get started by exploring our favorite hardware and software wallet options for ANT.

The Trezor Model T is a cryptocurrency hardware wallet that supports over 1,000 blockchain projects, including Bitcoin and ERC-20 tokens.

Coinbase has launched a software wallet for crypto investors, which supports various ERC-20 tokens, decentralized applications, and other blockchain projects. Coinbase Wallet allows users to easily make crypto payments to friends using usernames instead of long addresses.

In cryptocurrency, owning a crypto wallet is similar to having a personal bank vault. A cryptocurrency wallet ensures that your digital assets are safely kept and conveniently accessible as virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and countless others become increasingly ingrained in our daily lives.

You can look at it as a unique access code to a decentralized financial system, which enables you to send, receive, and manage bitcoins with a few simple taps. The Exodus Web3 Wallet, in particular, offers this convenience, making it a comfortable and easy choice for managing your diverse crypto needs.

With that in mind, having a secure web wallet like the Exodus Web3 Wallet gives you the confidence to have complete control over your money with a cryptocurrency wallet, doing away with the need for intermediaries and giving you a degree of anonymity and independence that is unmatched by conventional financial systems. A wallet like this feels like carrying your entire financial world in your pocket, ready to connect you to opportunities such as decentralized applications (DApps), staking for rewards, and exploring the exciting world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Before investing in cryptocurrency, what is a Web3 wallet? To better understand its purpose, think of your Web3 wallet as your entry point to the decentralized web, where you can easily manage your digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, and engage with a wide range of blockchain-based services. These online wallets allow you to access NFT markets, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and other cutting-edge services that are a part of the blockchain ecosystem, in contrast to standard wallets, which are restricted to holding and transferring money.

Exodus supports many networks, including popular ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Other networks the Exodus Web3 Wallet supports include Algorand, Arbitrum Nova, Arbitrum One, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Fantom, Flare, and Optimism. Do note that the Aurora, Base, Flare, and Rootstock networks have limited support in Exodus, so you are advised to only send transactions for assets on these networks that will display in your wallet.

For these specific cryptos, you can use the network's block explorer to look up your address and see the complete transaction history of any assets on these networks. Block explorers will give you all the details you require. Additionally, they will be able to export your transaction history in CSV format.

Since your crypto wallet directly protects your priceless digital assets from potential threats, keeping them secure is imperative. The security of your cryptocurrency wallet should be considered, just as you wouldn't leave your actual wallet out in the open. Given the increase in cybercrime and hacking efforts, having a secure wallet is essential to safeguarding your savings from loss and unauthorized access.

Like bank vaults use locks and alarms to protect their assets, reputable cryptocurrency wallets use high-tech encryption methods and private keys. Setting security as your priority will preserve your present investments and provide peace of mind as you continue to explore the fascinating and always-changing world of cryptocurrencies.

Exodus is one of the best Web3 wallets available. It is an easy-to-use software wallet with solid security measures to protect your digital assets.

Because of this, Exodus is a dependable option for cryptocurrency users who value security and usability, regardless of skill level.

A well-designed interface ensures that users can navigate the wallet intuitively, find the features they need without hassle, and perform transactions smoothly. This is particularly important in Web3, where users often deal with complex actions such as interacting with DApps, managing multiple types of cryptocurrencies, and participating in DeFi protocols. A clean interface demystifies these processes, encouraging more people to explore and use Web3 technologies confidently.

Web3 represents the next phase of the internet, built on decentralised technologies like blockchain. This new web iteration, often referred to as 'Web3 ', brings numerous benefits, such as increased privacy, security, and control over your digital identity and assets.

Unlike traditional web applications, Web3 platforms give you direct ownership of your data and interactions. For instance, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications allow you to manage your finances without relying on banks, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a new way to own and trade digital art and collectables. These innovations empower users to take control of their online presence in previously impossible ways, making the digital world more equitable and transparent.

Moreover, the Web3 ecosystem is designed to be user-friendly and accessible. Many platforms, like the Exodus Web3 Wallet, prioritize intuitive interfaces that make it easy for beginners to get started. Educational resources and communities are also plentiful, offering support and guidance for those new to the space. The collaborative nature of Web3 means that there are always people ready to help you navigate any challenges.

How to Buy Dai (DAI) * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-dai,2024-09-04,Benzinga,"Our team is diligently working to keep up with trends in the crypto markets. Keep up to date on the latest news and up-and-coming coins.

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, making them a risky investment choice. However, stablecoins like Dai offer a more stable alternative due to their backing by underlying assets, which helps mitigate price fluctuations. Dai stands out in the stablecoin landscape as it is uniquely backed by cryptocurrency rather than fiat currency. This enables it to maintain a peg to the US dollar while providing users the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). Discover how to buy DAI with our easy-to-follow guide!

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to acquire this popular stablecoin safely and securely.

The simplest way to purchase DAI is by opening an account with a cryptocurrency exchange that supports DAI token. Popular options include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and Crypto.com. Dai is also available on a range of crypto brokers' platforms, which means you'll get to choose between multiple crypto brokers when you open your account.

To create an account, simply visit the website or app and look for the ""Sign Up"" or ""Create Account option. Provide personal information like your name and email, and prepare to verify your identity with a government-issued ID.

Before you can buy or sell cryptocurrency, you'll need to add a funding method to your account. Most platforms allow you to buy cryptocurrency using wire transfer from your bank account. Nowadays, more and more platforms are now allowing credit card or debit card purchases. Be sure that your correct funding method is linked and cleared before proceeding.

After you've set up and funded your trading account, it's time to make your purchase. Most platforms offer you access to a multitude of order types, ranging from quick-executing market orders to strictly controlled limit orders. Select the type of order that you want to place and take a look at the current price of DAI. In most cases, the price will be almost exactly equal to $1 USD. Set a price and number of DAI that you'd like to purchase and submit your order through your trading platform.

Depending on current market conditions, it can take a few minutes to one hour to finish filling your order. Once successful, you'll see your tokens in your exchange wallet.

Dai is a stablecoin that runs on the Ethereum network. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that provides investors with a much-needed safeguard against volatility by maintaining a consistent price by tying itself to an underlying asset. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rise and fall as market demands change, stablecoins attempt to stay at a single price regardless of market conditions. In most cases, this value is $1 USD. This is why every crypto investor should learn how to buy DAI. Many crypto traders close their positions by selling their volatile cryptos for the stable DAI token or another stablecoin.

Most stablecoins are backed by fiat currency like the USD in bank accounts. Dai is different because it's backed by fiat currency pegged to cryptocurrency collateral staked on the Maker Dai Stablecoin System. This provides investors with a more transparent stablecoin, as collateral assets held on the Ethereum network can be viewed publicly. Dai works closely with Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.

Dai was developed by the team behind the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol instead of a single person or small group of individuals. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs itself entirely based on smart contract executions. MakerDAO tokens (which trade freely on many cryptocurrency exchanges) act as governance tokens, providing investors with a future vote on development matters. These tokens function in much the same way as owning shares of stocks.

Dai was introduced in 2017. Its soft peg to the USD quickly caused it to become among the most popular Ethereum-based stablecoins. Dai is currently the 18 largest cryptocurrency project when measured by total market capitalization. The coin has a market capitalization of around $5.3 billion with a daily trading volume of around $75.2 million.

Not sure where to get DAi? Consider a few of our favorite options that currently support Dai trading below.

Now that you know how to buy DAI you need to know how to store it safely. A cryptocurrency wallet provides you with a personal set of keys that you can use to store your investments off your exchange of choice. As an ERC-20 token, you can store Dai on almost any wallet that supports Ethereum. There are two types of crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Consider our favorite ERC-compliant wallets below if you aren't sure where to begin.

A hardware wallet is a USB-like device for storing tokens offline,. It offers better protection than software wallets, though at a higher cost. The Ledger Nano X is a top cryptocurrency cold storage device that securely stores private keys for Bitcoin, ERC-20 tokens and other assets offline. It connects to the Ledger Live app for managing transactions and can install up to 100 decentralized applications (dApps) for users interested in decentralized finance.

Software wallets are applications for desktops or mobiles that store cryptocurrencies using a private online wallet. While they are less secure than hardware wallets due to internet connectivity, they offer a free means to store investments off-exchange. These wallets typically support a wider variety of tokens since they are often open-source.

MetaMask is a free software wallet available as a browser extension and mobile app. It securely stores Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. It offers a key vault and private keys for quick token transfers and allows users to connect with numerous decentralized apps without compromising personal information.

Dai is intended as a store of volatility for investors in the cryptocurrency market. Holding Dai in the long-term won't result in much of a return for investors, as the price is tied to a 1:1 ratio with USD through the Maker Dai Stablecoin System.

You can profit from an investment in Dai by strategically converting the stablecoin into an altcoin. Wait for that coin to rise in value and then converting back to Dai. As Dai maintains a consistent value, you can buy back into the project of your choice when prices fall again without losing money. This allows you to accumulate more tokens and see a return on your investment.

The cryptocurrency market can be very volatile. Though stablecoins like Dai are unlikely to see frequent changes in value, non-backed assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins can show high volatility. Understanding how the market is moving day-to-day can help you enhance your crypto trading and make the most out of your investments.

Learn more about the market at a glance with our chart below.

If you're a new cryptocurrency investor, it can be confusing to understand the differences between altcoins and stablecoins. Stablecoins like Dai allow investors to access a stable resource when investing. This can be a crucial element for day trading and scalping in such a volatile market. If you're considering becoming a short-term cryptocurrency investor, learn how to use stablecoins effectively before you enter the market. This will help you avoid fees that come with converting your coins to fiat currency each time you want to exit a trade position.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/28112901/dai.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.2627450980392156
Best Desktop Crypto Wallets in 2024: Top 11 Picks,https://cryptopotato.com/best-desktop-crypto-wallets//,2024-09-04,CryptoPotato,"Desktop crypto wallets have some specifics compared to mobile wallets and browser extensions, but they also have a myriad of strengths.

In this guide, we'll review some of the best desktop crypto wallets in the industry, highlighting their key features, functionalities, advantages, and disadvantages. It will also provide you with some factors to consider before choosing a wallet, such as security, compatibility, and usability.

Desktop crypto wallets are specialized software applications that allow you to securely store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies directly from your personal computer.

They are typically non-custodial wallets, meaning you retain complete control over your private keys and, consequently, your assets. One of their main benefits is enhanced security compared to web-based alternatives and more features and options to explore and leverage.

Further, since desktop wallets only connect to the internet when necessary, they are less exposed to online crypto threats, such as hacking and phishing.

That doesn't mean they're not immune to attacks. Desktop wallets are still susceptible to risks like malware and phishing attacks that could compromise the user's computer. If, for some reason, your computer gets damaged and you don't have a backup, you've likely lost your funds too.

Suggested: 9 Tips For Securing Your Bitcoin and Crypto Wallets You Must Follow

The following are some of the best desktop crypto wallets in terms of functionality, popularity, key characteristics, and other essential metrics.

Trezor is a household name in the crypto space. It is one of the leading hardware wallet manufacturers in terms of product range, popularity, security, and innovation.

Among the most popular Trezor products is the Trezor Safe 3, which offers a strong combination of privacy, security, and extensive cryptocurrency support. It is an excellent choice for those who need a secure yet flexible hardware wallet.

Its compatibility with advanced security features like Shamir backup and support for over 8,000 digital assets sets it apart from many competitors. Moreover, the Safe 3 is compatible with various operating systems, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. For mobile users, it supports iOS and Android devices through the Trezor Suite Lite app.

However, note the lack of a touchscreen and limited support for certain networks when deciding if it is the right wallet for your needs. Despite that, the Trezor Safe 3 is a reliable and secure solution for managing various digital assets.

If you're looking for a solution that has a touchscreen, you can check out Trezor Safe 5 - the newest iteration of the hardware wallet. it does come at a steeper price, however, so keep that in mind.

The Trezor Safe 3 is distinguished by its commitment to privacy. It is compatible with the Tor network, an anonymous web browser that helps users maintain their privacy online.

Additionally, the wallet utilizes Coinjoin, a method that anonymizes Bitcoin transactions by combining multiple payments into one transaction, making it difficult to trace individual payments.

The Safe 3 also supports the Shamir backup method, a security protocol that allows users to create multiple recovery shares for their private keys. This technique, widely used in Trezor's hardware wallets, including the Trezor Model T, enhances the security of the recovery process by allowing users to distribute their recovery information across multiple locations or trusted parties.

Beyond privacy and security, the Trezor Safe 3 stands out for its extensive support for over 8,000 coins and tokens. This wide-ranging compatibility makes it one of the most versatile hardware wallets available, surpassing many other models of supported digital assets. With a starting price of $79, the Safe 3 is powerful and more affordable than other Trezor models.

For Bitcoin enthusiasts, Trezor offers a limited-edition Bitcoin-only version of the Safe 3, featuring a distinctive black and orange design.

Ledger is a household name in the crypto industry. This company specializes in creating hardware crypto wallets with enhanced security and usability.

Ledger is known for installing Secure Element Chips in its products, most popularly the Ledger Nano S Plus. You can interact with it through the Ledger Live app, which allows you to manage your crypto, send and receive funds, and more on your desktop.

In addition to the Ledger Nano S PLus, you can also choose the Nano X, which provides additional features like Bluetooth connectivity, or Stax, one of Ledger's high-end models with a larger screen and advanced features.

It all depends on your needs and your willingness to pay. Nano S Plus is often a good value for its price and the features it offers. But if you're looking for more capability, Stax and Nano X are the go-to options.

As an example, let's use Ledger Nano S Plus.

Although the Ledger Nano S Plus shares many similarities with the Nano X, there are notable differences.

The Ledger Nano S Plus is equipped with top-tier security features, having a CC EAL5+ certification, which indicates a high level of protection. This certification reassures that the device is secure against various attacks.

The Nano S Plus also includes a built-in exchange feature, allowing you to manage your funds while you're on the move. The device features a touchscreen, enhancing its user interface and making it more dynamic and user-friendly than the previous Nano X model.

Exodus does not provide additional security mechanisms such as two-factor authentication (2FA), security locks, or scam alerts. However, the Exodus team proactively updates users about the wallet's status and any vulnerabilities addressed through regular software updates.

The security of the Exodus wallet largely depends on the security of the device on which it is installed. If a device is lost, compromised, or left unattended, the funds stored in the wallet could be at risk.

Exodus supports over 260 different cryptocurrencies, including ERC, SPL, and BEP standards. You can also manage and trade NFTs directly through the app.

Coinomi is known as one of the oldest wallets (established in 2014) and as a multi-language app catering to a broad audience in the crypto space, offering its platform in over 20 languages to accommodate users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

Electrum is known for its speed, security, and efficiency, launched in 2011 by Thomas Voegtlin, a researcher at INRIA. The wallet is open-source and released under the MIT License, making it freely available for use and allowing its code to be openly reviewed by the community. It is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Mac, Linux, and Android, making it accessible to a wide range of users. However, it currently does not support iOS devices.

Although it is an excellent choice for those focusing solely on Bitcoin, it may not be ideal for users looking to manage multiple cryptocurrencies (the wallet's complexity can pose a challenge for beginners).

Electrum is widely regarded as one of the most secure Bitcoin wallets available. Its long history in the market further reinforces its reputation for safety.

There are lots of critical security features to leave them out, so here are some of them:

OKX Wallet is a non-custodial, multichain digital asset management tool designed to provide users with a secure and efficient way to store and manage their cryptocurrencies.

The app is available in multiple versions, including mobile and web browser extensions, and can be downloaded for Mac OS and Windows.

OKX Wallet offers a decent level of security. The majority of user funds are stored in cold wallets -- which are kept offline.

The app allows you to establish two-factor authentication (2FA) and install emergency backup procedures in case you find yourself in an emergency. Moreover, the app is part of the OKX Risk Shield, which allocates a portion of the OKX exchange earnings to a risk reserve fund designed to protect user assets in case of unforeseen events.

OKX Wallet is equipped to handle over 30 different blockchain networks and more than 3,000 tokens, providing extensive support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

Atomic Wallet is a non-custodial wallet for those who seek support for various digital assets. It is compatible with over 1,000 coins and tokens, providing users with a versatile platform for managing their cryptocurrency portfolios.

The wallet is accessible on multiple platforms, including desktop versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as mobile applications available on Google Play, the App Store, and as an Android APK.

Atomic Wallet is available across various platforms, ensuring that users can manage their digital assets on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS devices.

Regular third-party security audits are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, with updates and improvements communicated through the wallet's social media channels.

However, Atomic Wallet does have some limitations in its security offerings. It lacks two-factor authentication (2FA), a common security feature found in many other wallets. Moreover, there is no integration with hardware wallets, which are often preferred for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency due to their enhanced security.

Sparrow Wallet is a versatile and secure Bitcoin wallet, designed to cater to both novice and experienced users.

With a strong emphasis on security, privacy, and user autonomy, Sparrow Wallet offers a comprehensive solution for managing Bitcoin holdings with transparency and control.

Sparrow Wallet comes equipped with a variety of features that cater to the needs of different types of Bitcoin users:

Sparrow Wallet's top priority is Security. The wallet's code is open-source, meaning it is available for public review.

Moreover, Sparrow uses Argon2, a password-hashing algorithm designed to provide strong protection against password cracking and other cyber-attacks. This makes it more difficult for attackers to compromise user accounts.

But another interesting feature is the Tor Network Integration, a lovely integration for those obsessed with privacy. It routes all communications through Tor, obscuring your IP address and making it harder for third parties to trace transactions.

The Binance Web3 Wallet is a self-custody cryptocurrency wallet providing a wide range of features on mobile and desktop.

This wallet is designed for managing, storing, and trading various digital assets, including coins, tokens, and NFTs, across some of the most prominent blockchain networks. As it weren't enough, it's compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and over 38 other blockchain networks.

Whether on a mobile device or desktop, you can effortlessly switch between the Binance exchange and the Web3 Wallet. This handy feature facilitates the quick transfer of funds between Binance exchange accounts and the Web3 Wallet, making it a practical tool for daily cryptocurrency transactions.

Binance Web3 Wallet offers a range of features designed to enhance the user experience and provide advanced asset management capabilities:

Security is a central focus of the Binance Web3 Wallet. By using advanced MPC technology, the wallet secures users' assets without needing a seed phrase, which is typically a vulnerable point in other wallets.

Instead, the wallet divides the private key into three ""key-shares,"" each protected by a recovery password and stored in separate locations -- on the user's device, in cloud storage, and within the Web3 Wallet. This method significantly mitigates the risk associated with centralized storage of private keys and enhances overall security.

Wasabi Wallet is an open-source, non-custodial Bitcoin wallet designed for desktop use, with a strong emphasis on privacy and security.

As a software solution that runs directly on your computer, Wasabi Wallet empowers users to manage their bitcoins while prioritizing the confidentiality of their transactions.

Wasabi Wallet is packed with features aimed at enhancing user privacy and security. Here are some of the most notable:

The wallet is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify it. Besides transparency, the wallet also puts a special focus on anonymity; the CoinJoin coordinator used by Wasabi cannot access or compromise the privacy of the participants. This ensures that the mixing process remains secure and anonymous.

Moreover, Wasabi Wallet implements hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, avoids address reuse, and mandates coin labeling, all contributing to maintaining user privacy and security.

Currently, Wasabi Wallet supports only Bitcoin, reflecting its focus on providing a specialized, privacy-centric tool for Bitcoin users.

While they're suitable for those who frequently work with their laptops and PCs and need to manage their crypto assets on-site, it's fair to lay out some of the advantages and disadvantages of desktop wallets. Here are some pros explained:

Now, let's go with the bad:

With various options available, it's important to consider several factors to ensure the wallet you choose meets your security, compatibility, and usability needs.

A fundamental aspect of any crypto wallet is control over private keys. Choosing a wallet that allows you to manage your private keys directly is vital. This ensures that you, not a third party, have complete control over your funds, providing an additional layer of security.

For enhanced security, look for wallets that support two-factor authentication (2FA). This feature requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device, before granting access to your wallet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Similarly, check the wallet's encryption standards and key storage methods. Strong encryption protocols and secure key storage are critical in protecting your wallet from potential breaches and unauthorized access. A wallet with robust backup options ensures that you can easily regain access to your digital assets, minimizing the risk of permanently losing your funds.

It might be obvious, but make sure your wallet is compatible with your device and operating system, whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Moreover, make sure your wallet supports hardware integration if you're looking for extra compatibility and usability with other devices. There are certain additional features to keep an eye on. For example, some desktop wallets offer built-in conversion features, enabling users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. This allows you to rebalance your portfolio without transferring funds to an external exchange.

Also, make sure the wallet you choose supports the cryptocurrency you plan to use. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to download it.

Choose a wallet that is actively developed and regularly updated with the latest technological advancements and security patches. Moreover, check for customer support services and make sure it is at least decent enough to guide you through basic questions.

Again, desktop wallets are not a replacement for hardware wallets, which are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency over the long term. Desktop wallets, however, are suitable for holding smaller amounts that you need to access more frequently.

Cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms and colors, each offering distinct advantages and features tailored to different user needs. Hot wallets and cold storage are two popular methods of storing digital assets today.

Let's begin with hot wallets.

Hot wallets are software applications designed to manage and transact cryptocurrencies. These wallets are always connected to the internet and are available on various platforms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop, of course. What makes these applications popular is their ease of use and accessibility, making them a common choice for daily transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Web Wallets: Typically installed as browser extensions on popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. They allow you to manage, store, and transact cryptocurrencies directly through web browsers. They often support dApps, Web3 applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Mobile Wallets: Designed for iOS and Android devices, mobile wallets offer the convenience of managing digital assets on the go. However, be careful of exposing your phone to malware, and beware that there's always the chance you may lose the device.

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. Their offline status greatly reduces the risk of hacking and other online threats.

Cold wallets, another term for it, are especially suited for those looking to store crypto for the long run and seek a device with a level of security. Here are some of the key features of cold wallets:

A desktop wallet for cryptocurrencies is a software tool designed to be installed on a user's computer, enabling them to store, manage, and transfer digital currencies securely.

One of the key features of these wallets is that they grant users direct control over their private keys, ensuring that they maintain full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

Typically, desktop wallets are designed to maximize security by being used on a single device. But some wallets offer features that allow users to sync their wallet data between devices, often through cloud storage or other methods. It's essential to review the specific features of the wallet you are considering to understand its capabilities regarding multi-device access.

If you lose access to your desktop wallet or the stored device, you can restore it using a recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. This phrase is a critical backup that allows you to regain access to your digital assets. Make sure you save your recovery phrase securely and never share it with anyone, as it is the key to restoring your wallet.

Desktop wallets have become popular among crypto enthusiasts because they provide a secure environment for managing various cryptocurrencies. This guide on the best desktop crypto wallets highlights some of the top options in the market today.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_desktop_wallets_cover.jpg,0.1529411764705881
Best Desktop Crypto Wallets in 2024: Top 11 Picks in 2024 | Guides,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/cf272-best-desktop-crypto-wallets,2024-09-04,CryptoRank,"Desktop crypto wallets have some specifics compared to mobile wallets and browser extensions, but they also have a myriad of strengths.

In this guide, we'll review some of the best desktop crypto wallets in the industry, highlighting their key features, functionalities, advantages, and disadvantages. It will also provide you with some factors to consider before choosing a wallet, such as security, compatibility, and usability.

What is a Desktop Crypto Wallet?

Desktop crypto wallets are specialized software applications that allow you to securely store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies directly from your personal computer.

They are typically non-custodial wallets, meaning you retain complete control over your private keys and, consequently, your assets. One of their main benefits is enhanced security compared to web-based alternatives and more features and options to explore and leverage.

Further, since desktop wallets only connect to the internet when necessary, they are less exposed to online crypto threats, such as hacking and phishing.

That doesn't mean they're not immune to attacks. Desktop wallets are still susceptible to risks like malware and phishing attacks that could compromise the user's computer. If, for some reason, your computer gets damaged and you don't have a backup, you've likely lost your funds too.

While they're suitable for those who frequently work with their laptops and PCs and need to manage their crypto assets on-site, it's fair to lay out some of the advantages and disadvantages of desktop wallets. Here are some pros explained:

Now, let's go with the bad:

Best Desktop Crypto Wallets: Factors To Consider

What are Some Other Alternatives to Desktop Wallets?

Cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms and colors, each offering distinct advantages and features tailored to different user needs. Hot wallets and cold storage are two popular methods of storing digital assets today.

Let's begin with hot wallets.

Hot wallets are software applications designed to manage and transact cryptocurrencies. These wallets are always connected to the internet and are available on various platforms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop, of course. What makes these applications popular is their ease of use and accessibility, making them a common choice for daily transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Mobile Wallets: Designed for iOS and Android devices, mobile wallets offer the convenience of managing digital assets on the go. However, be careful of exposing your phone to malware, and beware that there's always the chance you may lose the device.

Cold Wallets: The Secure Alternative

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. Their offline status greatly reduces the risk of hacking and other online threats.

Cold wallets, another term for it, are especially suited for those looking to store crypto for the long run and seek a device with a level of security. Here are some of the key features of cold wallets:

One of the key features of these wallets is that they grant users direct control over their private keys, ensuring that they maintain full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

Can I Access my Desktop Wallet From Multiple Devices?

Typically, desktop wallets are designed to maximize security by being used on a single device. But some wallets offer features that allow users to sync their wallet data between devices, often through cloud storage or other methods. It's essential to review the specific features of the wallet you are considering to understand its capabilities regarding multi-device access.

Ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,508.95 as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price the cryptocurrency reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Ethereum launched in 2015 and is the most popular altcoin. Along with bitcoin, it has become one of the most recognizable forms of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum prices

The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $301.83 billion. ETH is currently up 54% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $301.83 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $312 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $300 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 71% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,508.95.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 54% year over year, compared to a 128% gain for bitcoin.

You might be more comfortable using online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Interactive Brokers, Webull, and Robinhood.

Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal have options for buying ETH. Cryptocurrency ATMs also allow for direct purchases.

How to safely store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.0980392156862746
Cryptocurrency Development: Creating and Managing Digital Currencies,https://techbullion.com/cryptocurrency-development-creating-and-managing-digital-currencies/,2024-09-03,TechBullion,"The world of finance is fast changing. One of the most significant developments in recent years is the rise of cryptocurrency. This digital form of money has revolutionized the way people think about and use currency. The creation and management of digital currencies involve complex processes, but they offer tremendous opportunities for both individuals and businesses.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, often based on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This decentralized structure makes cryptocurrencies resistant to censorship and fraud.

Bitcoin, created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been developed, each with unique features and use cases. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.

Cryptocurrencies are often seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems. They offer greater transparency, lower transaction costs, and faster transfer times compared to conventional banking methods. However, they also come with risks, including volatility and regulatory uncertainty.

The Process of Creating a Cryptocurrency

Creating a cryptocurrency is a multi-step process that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography. Below are the key steps involved in developing a digital currency:

Define the Purpose of the Cryptocurrency

Before creating a cryptocurrency, it's essential to define its purpose. What problem does it solve? What is its target audience? For example, Bitcoin was created as a decentralized alternative to traditional currency. Ethereum, on the other hand, was developed to enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Defining the purpose of the cryptocurrency will guide its development and help differentiate it from the thousands of other digital currencies in the market.

Choose a Consensus Algorithm

A consensus algorithm is a process used by blockchain networks to validate transactions and ensure the integrity of the ledger. There are several types of consensus algorithms, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The most common algorithms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). PoW, used by Bitcoin, requires participants to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. PoS, used by Ethereum, allows participants to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold. The choice of consensus algorithm will impact the security, speed, and energy efficiency of the cryptocurrency.

Design the Blockchain Architecture

The blockchain architecture determines how the cryptocurrency will function. This includes deciding whether to use an existing blockchain platform, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, or to create a new one from scratch. Using an existing platform can save time and resources, but it may limit customization options. On the other hand, building a new blockchain allows for greater flexibility but requires significant technical expertise and resources.

Develop the Cryptocurrency Code

Once the blockchain architecture is in place, the next step is to develop the cryptocurrency code. This involves writing the code that will govern the creation, distribution, and management of the cryptocurrency. This code is typically written in programming languages such as C++, Python, or Solidity. It is crucial to ensure that the code is secure and free from vulnerabilities, as any weaknesses could be exploited by hackers.

Create the Cryptocurrency Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that allows users to store, send, and receive digital currencies. There are different types of wallets, including desktop wallets, mobile wallets, and hardware wallets. When developing a cryptocurrency, it's essential to create a wallet that is user-friendly and secure. The wallet should also support multiple platforms to ensure accessibility for a wide range of users.

Launch the Cryptocurrency

After the cryptocurrency code and wallet have been developed, the next step is to launch the cryptocurrency. This involves deploying the blockchain network, distributing the initial supply of coins or tokens, and making the cryptocurrency available for trading on exchanges. It's also important to create a marketing strategy to promote the cryptocurrency and attract users.

Maintain and Update the Cryptocurrency

Launching a cryptocurrency is just the beginning. To ensure its long-term success, it's essential to maintain and update the cryptocurrency regularly. This includes fixing bugs, implementing new features, and addressing security vulnerabilities. It's also important to engage with the community and gather feedback to improve the cryptocurrency over time.

Managing Digital Currencies

Once a cryptocurrency has been created, managing it effectively is crucial to its success. Managing digital currencies involves overseeing their distribution, ensuring their security, and promoting their adoption. Below are some key aspects of managing digital currencies:

Security

Security is one of the most critical aspects of managing digital currencies. Given the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, they are often targeted by hackers. To protect digital currencies from theft and fraud, it's essential to implement robust security measures. This includes using encryption, multi-signature wallets, and cold storage solutions to safeguard funds. Regular security audits and updates are also necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Regulation

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies widely from country to country. In some jurisdictions, cryptocurrencies are fully legal and regulated, while in others, they are banned or restricted. Managing digital currencies requires staying informed about the latest regulatory developments and ensuring compliance with local laws. This may involve registering the cryptocurrency with regulatory authorities, implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, and paying taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.

Adoption and Use

For a cryptocurrency to succeed, it must be widely adopted and used. This involves promoting the cryptocurrency to potential users, businesses, and investors. One way to increase adoption is to create partnerships with businesses that accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment. It's also important to make the cryptocurrency easy to use by developing user-friendly wallets and payment systems. Encouraging the development of dApps and other use cases for the cryptocurrency can also help drive adoption.

Community Engagement

Building a strong community is essential for the long-term success of a cryptocurrency. Engaging with the community through social media, forums, and events can help build trust and loyalty among users. It's also important to listen to feedback from the community and address any concerns or issues that arise. A strong and active community can help promote the cryptocurrency and drive its adoption.

Market Dynamics

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, with prices often fluctuating dramatically. Managing digital currencies requires staying informed about market trends and making strategic decisions to protect the value of the cryptocurrency. This may involve adjusting the supply of the cryptocurrency, implementing price stabilization mechanisms, or engaging in market-making activities. It's also important to monitor the performance of competitors and adapt to changes in the market.

Challenges and Opportunities in Cryptocurrency Development

Cryptocurrency development presents both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, creating and managing a digital currency requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography. It also involves navigating complex regulatory environments and managing security risks. On the other hand, the potential rewards are significant. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, create new business models, and empower individuals and communities.

Merkle Tree Efficiency in Blockchain: Essentials Explained,https://droomdroom.com/merkle-tree-efficiency-in-blockchain-explained/,2024-09-02,DoomDroom,"Blockchain technology has flipped the finance world on its head, yet amid the crypto buzz, a critical component often slips under the radar: the Merkle Tree. While flashy terms like mining algorithms and consensus mechanisms often steal the spotlight, Merkle Trees quietly serve as the unsung heroes of blockchain. They ensure data integrity and security across decentralized networks.

The integration of Merkle Tree efficiency in blockchain technology, particularly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has definitely cemented their status as a fundamental component of modern cryptography. Beyond the technical jargon and complex algorithms lies a simple truth -- Merkle Trees are indispensable for maintaining the trustless nature of blockchain.

Merkle Trees are a fundamental component of blockchain technology, enabling efficient and secure data verification. As a rule of thumb, they ensure data integrity by organizing transactions into a tree structure, where the Merkle Root serves as a unique fingerprint, detecting any tampering with the underlying data.

In this article, we'll walk through the inner workings of Merkle Trees and their specific applications in blockchain technology.

At its essence, a Merkle Tree is a data structure that arranges information in a hierarchical, tree-like format. This setup allows for efficient and secure verification of data within extensive datasets. Named after its creator, Ralph Merkle, this data structure has become a key element in various cryptographic systems, including blockchain technologies.

A Merkle Tree consists of multiple nodes, with each leaf node representing a hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node representing a hash of its child nodes.

At the very top, a node called the Merkle Root, encapsulates all the data within the tree, providing a unique identifier for the dataset. This structure is inverted compared to typical trees, with the root at the top and leaves at the bottom.

Well, think of it this way. You don't need the whole fruit basket just to taste one apple. Similarly, Merkle Trees lets you verify the integrity of a piece of data without needing the entire database. Isn't that smart?

The real power of a Merkle Tree lies in its ability to enable users to verify data integrity with minimal information.

Rather than needing access to the entire dataset, one can confirm that a specific piece of data belongs to the set by examining only a small portion of the tree -- essentially a ""proof"" that traces a path from the leaf node to the root. This efficiency is particularly valuable in decentralized systems, like blockchains, where information is spread across multiple nodes.

Read how cryptocurrency is impacting the global financial system by challenging traditional banking in this detailed article by DroomDroom.

An incredibly major challenge in decentralized networks, such as blockchain, is efficiently managing and verifying data across multiple nodes. In centralized systems, data stored in a single location is relatively easy to verify and maintain. However, in decentralized networks where data is replicated across numerous nodes. Which means it ensures data integrity becomes significantly more complex.

You know, here's a neat trick, Merkle Trees offers a smart and beautiful solution to this issue. By organizing transactions into a tree structure, blockchains use Merkle Roots to verify the integrity of large datasets swiftly and efficiently.

This approach not only cuts down on the data that needs to be stored and processed but also boosts network security by making it extremely difficult to alter past transactions without detection.

For example, in Bitcoin, each block contains a Merkle Root summarizing all transactions within that block. When a new block is added to the blockchain, its Merkle Root is included in the block header, which is then used to verify the block's integrity. If even a single transaction within the block were altered, the Merkle Root would change, indicating tampering.

This verification method is not only efficient but also scales logarithmically with the number of transactions. As the number of transactions increases, the computational effort required to verify the block increases at a much slower rate. This scalability is a key reason why Merkle Trees are so effective in blockchain technology.

Now that we've established what a Merkle Tree is and its significance in blockchain technology, let's delve into its mechanics. Understanding the inner workings of a Merkle Tree involves exploring its structure, the hashing process, and how it efficiently ensures data integrity across a decentralized network, shall we?

A Merkle Tree is a binary tree, where each node has at most two children. The structure begins with the leaf nodes, the lowest level representing individual pieces of data -- typically transaction hashes in the blockchain. Moving up the tree, each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes, culminating in the topmost node, known as the Merkle Root.

By the way, here's a fun fact! Each level of the tree acts like a checkpoint so as to confirm the authenticity of the information below it.

This hierarchical structure is both efficient and resilient. Any change in a single transaction will propagate up the tree, altering the Merkle Root and signaling data tampering.

Hashing is fundamental in constructing Merkle Trees. A hash function takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hexadecimal number. This process is deterministic, meaning the same input always produces the same output, but even the smallest change in input produces a vastly different hash.

Let me explain you in a nutshell. So basically what happens is that in blockchain systems like Bitcoin, the SHA-256 hash function is used. This function takes each transaction and hashes it to produce a 256-bit number. These hashes are then combined in pairs and hashed again to form the next level of the tree.

Once you've selected a reputable platform, go to its website or download the mobile app, and look for an option to sign up or create an account. You'll be prompted to provide basic personal information, such as your email address and a password. After this, you may need to verify your identity by submitting personal documents like a government-issued ID and proof of address, in compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

To deposit funds into your account, go to the ""Deposit"" section. This section is typically located in your account settings or wallet area. Depending on the platform, you can deposit fiat currency like USD or EUR, or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

For fiat deposits, link your bank account or use a credit card/debit card. Follow the prompts to complete the transaction.

If you are depositing cryptocurrency, you will receive a wallet address specific to the currency you wish to deposit. Copy this address and use it in your external wallet to initiate the transfer.

Always double-check your details to avoid losing funds. Keep in mind any transaction fees and deposit times that may apply to your chosen cryptocurrency exchange.

When you've fully created and funded your account, you can place an order to buy AMP. Open the trading platform and choose the type of order that you'd like to use to buy AMP. Take a look at the current price of AMP and decide if you believe that the price will move up or down. Then, select an order type. Most brokers will provide you with a multitude of order types, but the most commonly used orders are:

Once you've decided what order type you want, place a buy order for the amount of AMP tokens you wish to purchase. Make sure that you thoroughly verify the order details prior to finalizing the transaction.

AMP is an ERC-20 token. An ERC-20 token is a project built using the Ethereum blockchain. Independent ERC-20 projects can be used to power a variety of protocols, using Ethereum's smart contract system to execute agreements according to predefined characteristics. ERC-20 tokens have the benefit of a wider range of storage options and more compatibility between projects when compared to independent blockchain projects like Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Introduced in 2020, AMP is a digital collateral token that can verify transfers of value among different asset types. Projects can use Amp to secure transactions and build networks that are able to initiate and execute transfers instantly and without interference. The AMP token is open-source and decentralized, which provides more potential for the integration of new assets and value transfers.

Amp is currently the 148th largest cryptocurrency project when measured by total market capitalization. It has a daily trading volume of about $15.9 million and a total market capitalization of over $311 million. AMP token is trading for around $0.003858 as of Sept. 2, 2024.

The best trading platform varies based on the investor's needs. Several popular and reputable exchanges are available for trading AMP. Consider these options to begin your crypto trading journey.

You can typically choose from two types of private crypto wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your coins and tokens offline, while software wallets allow you to store your investments online through a software application. Although hardware wallets will incur more of an upfront cost, they provide superior protection because they keep your coins in cold storage.

Explore a few of our favorite wallet choices for ERC-20 tokens like AMP below.

Long considered the gold standard for cryptocurrency cold storage, the Ledger Nano X provides investors with a private set of keys to store Bitcoin, all ERC-20 tokens and many additional assets offline. Your private Ledger key remains safe in a secure chip, and you can assess and access your investments wherever you go. The Ledger Nano X connects with the Ledger Live app for sending and receiving coins and tokens. It also allows the installation of up to 100 decentralized applications (dApps), making it useful for those interested in decentralized finance.

Coinbase is one of the internet's largest cryptocurrency marketplaces -- and its newly introduced Coinbase Wallet makes it easier to manage your investments on-the-go. The Coinbase Wallet is a software program that provides you with complete support for Bitcoin and any type of ERC-20 project. The Coinbase Wallet allows you to send crypto to other users without memorizing a long wallet address -- simply enter a name and transfer crypto in just a few minutes.

When you see your tokens in your exchange wallet, your next step is to decide how you want to earn a return on your investment. These are primary strategies you can use to earn a return on your AMP investment:

No matter which strategy you choose to take, you'll want to monitor the price of AMP and how it's changing regularly.

The cryptocurrency market can be exceptionally volatile. Monitor how the market is changing today with our chart below.

Though Amp's network is currently not one of the most popular cryptocurrency projects currently trading on major exchanges, it still retains a positive investor sentiment for the future. If you're thinking about investing in AMP, you may want to diversify your portfolio with other types of Ethereum-based token projects, like Chainlink or AAVE.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/09154619/amp.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.2784313725490195
Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work: Which is Better?,https://sfctoday.com/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work-which-is-better/,2024-09-01,sfctoday.com,"The debate between Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) has been a central topic in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for years. These two consensus mechanisms are the most widely used methods for validating transactions and securing blockchain networks. While both have their merits, they differ significantly in terms of how they achieve consensus, their environmental impact, security, and scalability.

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, understanding the differences between PoS and PoW, along with their respective strengths and weaknesses, is crucial for anyone interested in the future of blockchain technology. This article provides an in-depth comparison of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work, exploring their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages, and the ongoing debate over which is better.

Proof of Work (PoW) is the original consensus mechanism used by the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin whitepaper as a way to secure the network and validate transactions without the need for a central authority. PoW works by requiring participants (known as miners) to solve complex mathematical puzzles, known as cryptographic hashes, to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain.

The puzzles that miners solve are computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power and energy consumption. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets the right to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) and any transaction fees associated with the block. This process is what makes PoW-based blockchains secure, as it would be extremely costly and difficult for a malicious actor to gain control of the network.

The difficulty of these puzzles is adjusted over time to ensure that blocks are added at a consistent rate. As more miners join the network, the difficulty increases, requiring more computational power to solve the puzzles. This mechanism also ensures that the network remains decentralized, as no single miner or group of miners can easily dominate the network.

One of the main advantages of PoW is its proven track record of security. Bitcoin, which operates on a PoW consensus mechanism, has been running securely since its inception in 2009, with no major security breaches. This long-standing security record has made PoW the gold standard for blockchain security, particularly for decentralized and trustless systems.

PoW also provides a high level of decentralization, which is one of the core principles of blockchain technology. Because the process of mining is open to anyone with the necessary computational power, PoW networks are resistant to centralization. This decentralization makes it difficult for any single entity to gain control over the network, enhancing its security and integrity.

Another advantage of PoW is its resistance to certain types of attacks, such as the Sybil attack, where an attacker creates multiple fake identities to gain control of the network. In PoW, each identity (or miner) must expend significant resources to participate, making it prohibitively expensive to carry out such an attack.

Despite its strengths, PoW has several significant disadvantages, particularly in terms of environmental impact and scalability. The most commonly cited issue with PoW is its energy consumption. Because PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles, it necessitates the use of vast amounts of electricity. As the network grows and the difficulty of mining increases, so too does the energy required to maintain the network.

This high energy consumption has led to widespread criticism of PoW-based cryptocurrencies, particularly in the context of climate change and environmental sustainability. Bitcoin mining, for example, is estimated to consume as much electricity as some small countries, leading to concerns about the long-term viability of PoW-based networks in an increasingly energy-conscious world.

Another disadvantage of PoW is its scalability limitations. Because PoW relies on solving complex puzzles, the time it takes to add new blocks to the blockchain is relatively slow, limiting the number of transactions the network can process per second. This has led to congestion and high transaction fees on networks like Bitcoin during periods of high demand. While various scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, have been proposed, they have yet to fully address the inherent limitations of PoW.

Finally, PoW has been criticized for its tendency towards centralization in practice. While PoW is designed to be decentralized, the high costs associated with mining (such as purchasing and maintaining specialized hardware and paying for electricity) have led to the emergence of large mining pools. These pools consolidate hashing power, potentially giving a few entities disproportionate influence over the network.

Proof of Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism that was introduced as a more energy-efficient and scalable solution compared to PoW. PoS was first implemented in the cryptocurrency Peercoin in 2012 and has since been adopted by several other blockchains, including Ethereum 2.0, which is transitioning from PoW to PoS.

In a PoS system, validators (often referred to as stakers) are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to ""stake"" as collateral. The more coins a validator stakes, the higher their chances of being selected to validate a block and earn rewards. However, the selection process is typically randomized to prevent wealthier participants from always being chosen.

Unlike PoW, which requires participants to expend significant computational power, PoS relies on the economic stake of participants to secure the network. This eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and reduces the environmental impact of the network. Validators in a PoS system are incentivized to act honestly, as they stand to lose their staked coins if they attempt to validate fraudulent transactions.

One of the most significant advantages of PoS is its energy efficiency. Because PoS does not require participants to solve complex puzzles, it consumes far less electricity than PoW. This makes PoS a more environmentally friendly option, which is particularly important as concerns about the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies continue to grow.

PoS also offers improved scalability compared to PoW. Because validators do not need to perform energy-intensive calculations, new blocks can be added to the blockchain more quickly, allowing the network to process more transactions per second. This increased throughput makes PoS networks better suited to handle high volumes of transactions, reducing congestion and transaction fees.

Another advantage of PoS is its reduced barrier to entry. In a PoS system, participants do not need expensive hardware or access to cheap electricity to become validators. Instead, they simply need to hold and stake the network's native cryptocurrency. This opens up participation to a broader range of individuals, promoting greater decentralization and inclusivity.

Additionally, PoS provides a built-in mechanism for punishing malicious behavior. Validators who attempt to validate fraudulent transactions can lose their staked coins, a process known as ""slashing."" This economic incentive encourages honest behavior and enhances the security of the network.

Despite its advantages, PoS is not without its drawbacks. One of the primary criticisms of PoS is that it can lead to wealth concentration and centralization. In a PoS system, those who hold more coins have a higher probability of being selected as validators and earning rewards. Over time, this can lead to a situation where the wealthiest participants accumulate even more wealth, potentially giving them undue influence over the network.

Another concern with PoS is the potential for ""nothing at stake"" attacks. In PoW, miners must expend real resources (such as electricity) to participate in the network, giving them a strong incentive to support the longest, most valid chain. In PoS, however, validators do not incur significant costs for creating blocks, which could theoretically lead to a situation where they support multiple chains at once, undermining the security of the network. To address this, many PoS systems implement penalties for validators who attempt to validate conflicting blocks, but the issue remains a point of contention.

PoS is also relatively new compared to PoW, and as such, it has not been as extensively tested in practice. While several PoS-based cryptocurrencies have operated successfully for years, they have not faced the same level of scrutiny or attacks as PoW-based networks like Bitcoin. As PoS continues to gain adoption, it will be important to monitor its performance and security under real-world conditions.

Finally, PoS systems can be more complex to implement and understand compared to PoW. The selection of validators, staking mechanisms, and slashing penalties all add layers of complexity that can be difficult for both developers and users to navigate. This complexity could pose a barrier to adoption, particularly for those new to cryptocurrency.

One of the most high-profile examples of a blockchain transitioning from PoW to PoS is Ethereum. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was originally launched with a PoW consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin's. However, due to the scalability limitations and environmental concerns associated with PoW, the Ethereum community decided to transition to PoS through a series of upgrades collectively known as Ethereum 2.0.

The transition to Ethereum 2.0 has been a multi-year process, involving the introduction of a new PoS-based blockchain called the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain operates alongside the original Ethereum PoW chain, and once fully merged, it will replace PoW entirely. This transition is seen as a critical step in Ethereum's evolution, addressing key issues such as scalability, energy consumption, and network security.

The shift to PoS is expected to reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by over 99%, making it one of the most environmentally friendly blockchain networks. Additionally, PoS is anticipated to improve Ethereum's scalability, enabling the network to process thousands of transactions per second, compared to the current rate of around 15 transactions per second under PoW.

However, the transition to PoS has not been without challenges. Delays in the rollout of Ethereum 2.0, concerns about centralization, and uncertainty about the impact on miners and stakeholders have all been points of contention within the Ethereum community. Nevertheless, the move to PoS is seen as a necessary evolution for Ethereum, setting the stage for the future of decentralized applications and blockchain technology.

The question of whether Proof of Stake or Proof of Work is better ultimately depends on the specific goals and requirements of a blockchain network. Both consensus mechanisms have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them should be informed by the trade-offs each entails.

Proof of Work is a time-tested and highly secure consensus mechanism that has proven its resilience over more than a decade of use in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its decentralized nature and resistance to certain types of attacks make it a strong choice for networks that prioritize security and decentralization. However, its high energy consumption and scalability limitations are significant drawbacks, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability.

Proof of Stake, on the other hand, offers a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to PoW. Its lower barriers to entry and reduced environmental impact make it an attractive option for networks focused on inclusivity and sustainability. However, concerns about centralization, wealth concentration, and the relative novelty of the technology mean that PoS is not without its risks.

In practice, the decision between PoS and PoW will depend on the specific needs of the blockchain project, the preferences of its community, and the regulatory and environmental context in which it operates. Some networks may choose to implement hybrid models that combine elements of both PoS and PoW, while others may explore entirely new consensus mechanisms that address the shortcomings of both.

As the cryptocurrency and blockchain space continues to evolve, the debate between PoS and PoW will likely remain a central topic of discussion. While there is no definitive answer to which is better, the ongoing experimentation and innovation in the field will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each consensus mechanism.

Proof of Stake and Proof of Work represent two fundamentally different approaches to achieving consensus in blockchain networks. While PoW has been the dominant consensus mechanism for many years, the rise of PoS reflects a growing recognition of the need for more energy-efficient and scalable solutions. Both PoS and PoW have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them should be made based on the specific goals and priorities of the network in question.

As the blockchain industry continues to mature, the competition and coexistence between PoS and PoW will likely drive further innovation, leading to new consensus mechanisms and improvements to existing ones. Whether one will eventually emerge as the clear superior choice remains to be seen, but what is certain is that both will continue to play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralized technologies.",https://sfctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Proof-of-Stake-vs.-Proof-of-Work-Which-is-Better-1.jpg,0.3960784313725489
Billionaires Are Buying These 2 Cryptocurrencies Hand Over Fist,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaires-are-buying-these-2-cryptocurrencies-hand-over-fist,2024-09-01,NASDAQ Stock Market,"With cryptocurrency emerging as a stand-alone asset class, a growing number of billionaires are now hunting for potential investment opportunities. Some of them are buying cryptocurrencies for their enormous upside potential, while others are buying them for their ability to diversify a portfolio or hedge their overall market position.

Based on public statements and official 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it's possible to put together a snapshot look at what top billionaires are buying. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are at the top of their shopping lists.

1. Bitcoin

Hedge fund billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones are two high-profile names making the case for why Bitcoin should become a part of a diversified portfolio. As Druckenmiller has pointed out, Bitcoin has many of the same properties as gold, making it interesting as a potential long-term store of value. And Paul Tudor Jones has made the case that Bitcoin can be one way to hedge against geopolitical and macroeconomic risk.

Billionaire hedge fund managers have emerged as some of the biggest buyers of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Based on biweekly market data from CoinShares, it's possible to see at a glance which hedge funds are the biggest buyers.

Some of them -- such as Jane Street and Susquehanna International Group -- may be familiar names to regular readers of The Wall Street Journal. Others, such as Boston-based Bracebridge Capital -- which is run by the wealthiest female hedge fund manager in the U.S. -- may be less familiar. But what they all have in common is that they're loading up on Bitcoin.

And don't forget about billionaire Larry Fink of BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), which manages over $10 trillion in assets. Back in June 2023, BlackRock was the first to file a spot Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC. That ETF -- the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) -- is now the most popular spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink is also a regular guest on CNBC, explaining why average investors should be investing in Bitcoin.

Much of the billionaire demand for Bitcoin is being driven by its upside potential. The growing consensus is that Bitcoin now has a path to $150,000 by the end of 2025. And from there, the sky's the limit. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has suggested that Bitcoin could be worth as much as $3.8 million per coin by 2030.

2. Ethereum

While Bitcoin has garnered the most attention from billionaires, don't sleep on Ethereum. Arguably, Ethereum gives you much more diversification than Bitcoin since it's much more involved in every facet of the blockchain world. Ethereum is a smart contract blockchain network. It's a building block for everything from games and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to metaverse worlds.

But what billionaires like best about Ethereum is its potential to disrupt the traditional world of Wall Street. That's due to the enormous strides being made in decentralized finance (DeFi), which can be thought of as the blockchain version of traditional finance. For example, traditional finance has centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), while DeFi has decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap (CRYPTO: UNI).

Some of the best numbers about the disruptive potential of Ethereum come from Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. In this year's ""Big Ideas 2024"" report, she outlined exactly how much value is flowing from traditional finance to decentralized finance, especially smart contract blockchain networks such as Ethereum. Wood suggests that DeFi could grow at a 32% annualized rate over the next few years, making it a $5.2 trillion market opportunity by 2030.

If you're looking for a billionaire evangelist for Ethereum, look no further than Mark Cuban. Based on his experience as a tech entrepreneur and angel investor, he's well-positioned to discuss the benefits of Ethereum. Cuban has been beating the drum for Ethereum ever since 2021, when he praised its versatility and technological sophistication.

Do billionaires buy altcoins?

Based on the above, you might conclude that billionaires are only buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. That's not necessarily the case. If you parse the latest data from CoinShares, a handful of other cryptocurrencies appear to be attracting the attention of large institutional investors. These include Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC), XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA).

However, the amount of money that is flowing into these altcoins seems trivial in comparison. For example, over $8 billion has flowed into Bitcoin since the start of the year, and nearly $1 billion into Ethereum. In comparison, $34 million has flowed into Litecoin, $31 million into Solana, $22 million into XRP, and $12 million into Cardano.

This strategy of loading up on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while making relatively tiny crypto investments elsewhere, is probably one that makes sense for the average investor. You'll get the best of both worlds: enormous upside potential combined with some additional diversification for your portfolio.

What is Trust wallet?,https://www.theblock.co/learn/313730/what-is-trust-wallet,2024-09-01,The Block,"Trust Wallet TWT -4.83% TWT -4.83% See Details is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to store, manage and engage with various digital assets. It supports numerous cryptocurrencies, including popular ones like bitcoin, ether, ERC-20 tokens, Solana and nonfungible tokens. It is available as a mobile app on Android and iOS platforms and as a browser extension.

History and development of Trust Wallet

Trust Wallet was founded in 2017 by Ukrainian software developer Viktor Radchenko. Radchenko explained in an interview that his motivations for building the wallet were to make crypto more accessible and that he wanted a way to store his tokens on his phone. The first version of Trust Wallet was released just two weeks after he began.

Initially, Trust Wallet was designed as a simple wallet for storing ERC-20 and ERC-223 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. However, as the cryptocurrency market expanded and diversified, so did its functionality, which grew to support additional blockchains and their tokens, such as Solana.

In July 2018, Trust Wallet was acquired by Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, making the wallet the official on-chain wallet for the exchange. The acquisition enabled Trust Wallet to integrate with Binance's ecosystem and provided Binance users with an on-chain mobile wallet. Since the acquisition, Trust Wallet has continued to develop, adding support for multiple blockchains, decentralized applications and staking features.

In 2022, Radchenko stepped down as CEO of Trust Wallet to focus on his family and was replaced by Eowyn Chen, former Marketing Vice President at Binance.

In 2023, Trust Wallet partnered with Moonpay and Ramp to provide users with fiat off and on ramps, allowing the conversion to fiat directly within the app.

Features and functions

Trust Wallet offers several features and functions that make it a versatile tool for managing digital assets. Trust Wallet claims to support over 10 million tokens from over 100 blockchains, making it one of the most comprehensive wallets available.

In addition to basic wallet features like sending, receiving, and storing digital assets, the app's integration with various decentralized exchanges allows users to trade and swap cryptocurrencies directly within the app.

Trust Wallet also includes a built-in Dapp browser, which allows users to interact with decentralized applications directly from their wallet. This is particularly useful for participating in decentralized finance DeFi activities.

Additionally, Trust Wallet allows users to stake certain cryptocurrencies directly from their wallet, earning rewards as additional tokens. The wallet also supports the storage and management of NFTs. Through its integrations with Moonpay and Ramp, Trust Wallet also supports purchases of crypto with fiat directly within the app.

In terms of security features, the app offers biometric authentication and an in-built security scanner, which provides warnings about potentially risky transactions to help protect users from scams.

What's needed to set up a Trust Wallet account?

Setting up a Trust Wallet account is a straightforward process.

First, users need to download the app, which is free on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, or download the browser extension. After installing the app on their chosen device, users can follow the prompts to create a new wallet.

Trust Wallet will then generate a 12-word recovery phrase, which users must securely store, as it is the only way to recover their wallet if they lose access to their device.

After creating the wallet, users can enhance security by enabling biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) and setting a passcode.

Once the wallet is set up, users can add cryptocurrencies by purchasing them through the app, receiving them from another wallet, or transferring them from an exchange.

What is Trust Wallet Token?

Trust Wallet Token was launched in 2020 and serves as the native utility token within the Trust Wallet ecosystem. TWT holders can participate in governance decisions, influencing the platform's future by voting on matters such as which blockchains should be supported, as well as gaining access to discounts, payment options, and other benefits.

While Trust Wallet is generally considered secure, there are some risks with using non-custodial wallets, since users are solely responsible for their private keys. Losing the 12-word recovery phrase means losing access to the wallet and the funds stored within it.

Users also need to be vigilant against phishing attacks, where malicious actors attempt to steal private keys or recovery phrases by posing as legitimate entities. It is important for users to always ensure that they're interacting with the official Trust Wallet website and app.","https://www.tbstat.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,q=75/wp/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-13.09.51.png",0.4666666666666666
How To Buy Dogecoin (DOGE),https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-buy-dogecoin-doge-7370204,2024-09-01,Investopedia,"Khadija Khartit is a strategy, investment, and funding expert, and an educator of fintech and strategic finance in top universities. She has been an investor, entrepreneur, and advisor for more than 25 years. She is a FINRA Series 7, 63, and 66 license holder.

Dogecoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency available on most crypto exchanges that was created as a parody of Bitcoin, and has gained significant attention due to its meme-inspired branding and support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While some see Dogecoin as a promising crypto asset due to its surges in value and growing mainstream acceptance, others warn that it is highly volatile, with billions of new coins being minted each year. Like all cryptocurrency, investing in Dogecoin is risky. Therefore, ensure you do your due diligence before adding this meme coin to your portfolio.

What Is Dogecoin?

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013 as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation of the crypto market at that time.

Similar to other digital currencies, Dogecoin operates on a blockchain network and is secured by cryptography. A promising feature is its fast transaction speed with low transaction fees, which makes it attractive for micro-transactions. Additionally, the Dogecoin community has a history of supporting charitable causes and individuals, including raising funds for the Jamaican bobsled team, collecting donations to build a well in Kenya, and sponsoring NASCAR driver Josh Wise.

Dogecoin made headlines in February 2023 when one of Elon Musk's tweets caused a spike in Dogecoin's price. Additionally, in December 2022, the Dogecoin Foundation announced a new fund of 5 million DOGE (around $345,000 at the time) to support the development of the cryptocurrency's ecosystem to help ensure the longevity and sustainability of Dogecoin.

How To Buy Dogecoin

In order to buy Dogecoin, users need to create an account on a reputable cryptocurrency exchange, which is a digital marketplace where you can buy, sell, and trade multiple cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Once an account is set up and verified, you can deposit funds, either in the form of fiat currency or cryptocurrency.

Verify your account with personal details like proof of address. In some cases, you may also need to undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.

Step 3: Deposit funds to your account.

You can deposit money into your cryptocurrency account through various methods, such as credit or debit cards, depending on the exchange's policies, as well as your jurisdiction.

Step 4: Find DOGE, check market price, and buy.

Search for Dogecoin (DOGE) on the exchange, check its market price, and make a purchase. Generally, it takes less than a minute before you can see DOGE in your crypto exchange wallet. After making the purchase, you can transfer your Dogecoin(s) to your other wallets.

Alternative Ways To Buy Dogecoin

An alternative way to buy Dogecoin is through peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces that allow you to buy DOGE directly from other individuals instead of using a centralized exchange. These platforms match buyers and sellers and provide a secure escrow system to facilitate the transaction.

One more way of buying DOGE is by exchanging it with other forms of crypto in your wallet. For example, if you have Bitcoin or Ethereum, you can exchange them for Dogecoin on exchanges like Uniswap and Kraken. This method can be faster and more cost-effective than buying DOGE with fiat currency.

What You Need To Open a Cryptocurrency Exchange Account

To open a cryptocurrency exchange account, you typically need to provide the following documents and information.

Personal Information

Here are some of the key pieces of personal information that a crypto enthusiast may need to provide to open a cryptocurrency exchange account:

Additionally, many cryptocurrency exchanges require users to go through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process to verify their identity. This may involve submitting government-issued identification documents, such as a passport or driver's license, and a proof of address, such as a utility bill or bank statement.

Minimum Deposits

The minimum deposit to open a cryptocurrency exchange account varies widely depending on the exchange and the type of account you are opening. Some exchanges require no minimum deposit at all, while others may require a deposit of at least $10, $50, or even $100 or more. The deposit amount may also depend on the payment method you are using.

In addition to the minimum deposit, some exchanges may also require a minimum balance to be maintained in the account to avoid account closure or inactivity fees. These fees can range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars per year, depending on the exchange and the amount of the minimum balance requirement.

Centralized exchanges (CEX) are cryptocurrency trading platforms that are operated and controlled by a central authority. They typically require users to create an account in order to trade cryptocurrencies. CEXs are popular because they offer a wide variety of trading pairs, high liquidity, and advanced trading features.

One of the main benefits of centralized exchanges is their high level of security. CEXs typically have strong security measures in place to protect user funds. In addition, CEXs often have customer support teams to assist users with issues such as deposit and withdrawal problems.

Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are cryptocurrency trading platforms that operate on a decentralized blockchain network, meaning that they are not controlled by a central authority. Instead, they use smart contracts and blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer trades between users. DEXs are popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts who value privacy, security, and decentralization.

One of the main benefits of DEXs is that they offer a high level of security and privacy. Since DEXs do not hold user funds or personal information, they are less vulnerable to hacking attacks than centralized exchanges. Additionally, DEXs do not require KYC/AML (anti-money laundering) procedures, meaning that users can trade cryptocurrencies without providing personal information.

Hybrid Exchanges

Hybrid exchanges are cryptocurrency trading platforms that combine features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Top Cryptocurrencies: An In-Depth Analysis of the Market Leaders,https://techbullion.com/top-cryptocurrencies-an-in-depth-analysis-of-the-market-leaders/,2024-09-01,TechBullion,"Since Bitcoin was made in 2009, the universe of advanced monetary forms has grown enormously. At its commencement, it was an exclusive, misread sort of innovation. Nowadays its presence is felt deeply all over the world. From a decentralized point of view, top cryptocurrency offer security that is both embedded and transparent-pure information seed is directly to the value form in this method of transaction. Many digital currencies exist among which some have emerged as market leaders. These coins are referred to as top cryptocurrency. In this article, we will take a look at these leading top cryptocurrency, examining where they came from, what technological basis lurks beneath the surface, how they have performed on the market thus far, and how-if at all-they fit into our broader financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer of Top Cryptocurrency

Bitcoin, the first and most well-known of all top cryptocurrencies, was launched by an unknown person or team that was named in the former year after its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. It first enabled people to see that blockchain technology could become a decentralized network of computers, all keeping their records Bitcoin's standalone-based attributes are its scarcity, which leads to a maximum supply limit of 21 million coins, and that it is decentralized, in other words, immune from censorship and government control.

Bitcoin's position in the top cryptocurrency market today is unassailable. It consistently holds by far the largest market capitalization, often taking over 40% of the whole crypto market. What drives up the price? Factors such as institutional adoption, conditions on a large scale that favor monetary growth, and ""digital gold"" status. Bitcoin锦 is viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic instability and has thus become very popular among investors as an investment asset with which to store their savings But Bitcoin's scalability problems and energy consumption have generated

Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation of Decentralized Applications

In 2015, Ethereum was sent off by a group headed by Ethereum maker and engineer Vitalik Buterin. In 2015 the cost of Ethereum, began by a team headed by Ethereum maker and engineer Vitalik Buterin, zoomed to $137 billion. Ethereum isn't Bitcoin, which is a computerized cash. Then again, Ethereum is a blockchain stage involving a brilliant agreement mechanism. Ethereum is a stage that works on shrewd agreements. Smart contracts are automatically executing contracts, and the agreement terms between buyer and seller are directly written into code. With it users pay for transaction fees on the network or use it as a substitute currency to provide computational services.

Ether (ETH) is the currency of Ethereum. With this currency, users can pay for transactions on the Ethereum network or use it to purchase computational services. Ether will be the most valuable money in this system. The Ethereum platform is the linchpin of the bursting open decentralized finance sector (DeFi), a source of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and initial coin offerings. The incredible diversity and openness mean that all segments of society have been attracted to it: developers, enterprises, and investors are involved here, which makes this platform a cornerstone for today's top cryptocurrency.

Nevertheless, Ethereum has encountered obstacles over scalability and high gas fees that have especially worsened during network congestion periods. To address these problems, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 will see a shift from proof-of-work (PoW) and the associated power consumption for computers running nodes of the network towards proof-of-stake (PoS). This is intended to raise capacity on its part while reducing energy expenditure.

Binance Coin (BNB): The Utility Token with Multiple Use Cases

It's an original project that pairs the native top cryptocurrency of Binance, one of the world's biggest exchanges, with the asset. The original BNB was an ERC-20 token on Ethereum's blockchain that later moved over to Binance Chain, where it now resides.BNB was developed as a utility token that would provide users with discounts on trading fees within the Binance ecosystem.

Over the years BNB has taken on more and more roles. Now it is both the currency used to purchase lottery tickets at Launchpad (Binance's platform for token sales) and a means of making payments for goods or services from many businesses in China. Plus, you can use it to book hotel accommodations too. Binance has also introduced a mechanism for burning BNB tokens every quarter. That means some BNB is taken out of circulation permanently, thus reducing the supply and theoretically increasing its value. The success of BNB At the same time is inseparable from Binance's overall expanse and many other startup projects; Binance Smart Chain, like Ethereum with its virtual machine, supports smart contracts on its blockchains for example. (EVM). BSC has become popular for Dapp developers, particularly those working in DeFi applications, providing a low-cost alternative to Ethereum. This only contributes to BNB's rally.

Cardano (ADA): The Blockchain with a Scientific Approach

In aiming to address the scalability, interoperability, and sustainability that legacy blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have meanwhile fallen into, Cardano ventures onto this stage. Cardano was coordinated by Charles Hoskinson, among Ethereum's co-founders. It relied on peer-reviewed positioning theory and formal verification methods to ensure the safety and efficiency of its protocol and was developed with a research-led approach. ADA, Cardano's native top cryptocurrency, is used in the platform's governance, as well as for staking. Energy efficiency and security are both values embedded in the Ouroboros protocol which forms a consensus mechanism for the network's proof of stake.

Cardano presents a phase-in approach about how it is developing throughout every stage in the whole platform such as decentralization, smart contracts, and scalability. Interoperability is one of Cardano's key principles: because it can communicate not only with other blockchains but also classical financial systems, this provides a convenient means for enterprises as well as governments to utilize distributed ledger technology in their daily operations. While the Cardano ecosystem is still in an early stage, as development continues it is starting to see more and more signs of becoming a major force in the world of top cryptocurrencies

Solana (SOL): The High-Performance Blockchain

Starting transactions is one of the fastest ways of creating a scalable system due to its simple parser and high-speed messaging engine. Then, Anatoly Yakovenko launched Solana in 2020 with an eye for scalability in response systems that didn't offer themselves to all types or sizes of users. In Solana's architecture, the secret sauce is a mix of proof of stake and proof of history (PoH). That allows it to run thousands of transactions per second with very low latency. Sol is the spokesman of Solana-native top cryptocurrencies.

Its main purpose within the network serves to be as both a means of exchange (transaction fees) and a means of staking. Solana's scalability and low cost have already attracted an increasing number of projects to the platform, ranging from DeFi apps and NFTs to Web3 projects. The community around these is also growing fast. Moreover, recent higher-quality partnerships and collaborations give it additional weight to move into the space that Ethereum now occupies.

However, the rapid growth of Solana has not been without obstacles. Starting transactions is one of the fastest ways of creating a scalable system due to its simple parser and high-speed messaging engine.

Sol is the spokesman of Solana-native top cryptocurrencies.

Ripple (XRP): Bridging the Gap Between Traditional Finance and Blockchain

As Wave is a computerized installment convention and not a digital currency, a top decision for some individuals who need to send globally modest cash rapidly. Swell is not the same as other cryptographic forms of money that are overseen by decentralized networks. Instead of this, it works very closely with partner banks and financial institutions to speed up international fund transfers. The cryptographic money of Wave, XRP, isn't simply used to pay exchange expenses; it fills in as a significant monetary scaffold between various public monetary forms.

In today's world, many financial institutions worldwide have tried out Ripple's technology. It's also one of the most widely used blockchain payment solutions worldwide. However, Ripple faces significant regulatory challenges. One particular issue is in the United States, where a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) accuses it of issuing unlicensed securities through XRP.

Despite these challenges, Ripple continues to expand globally. In addition, the company targets emerging markets and areas with heavy remittance traffic. XRP's worth is firmly connected with the progress of Wave's installment organization and how capably it can address roadblocks that legislatures and controllers put in its manner.

Conclusion: The Evolving Landscape of Top Cryptocurrencies

The top cryptocurrency market is dynamic and evolving, it has always been like this. Upstart projects and products can pop up just out of nowhere. For instance, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Ripple represent some of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of capital and influence, the situation is anything different for batteries. Nor can Solana be forgotten in that regard.

Every crypto-currency has its strengths and difficulties and so does each offer opportunities for further future development. Investors and fans in top digital currency watch this space. It can change quickly because of technological breakthroughs or regulatory shifts, even with macroeconomic factors being added together. Today's top cryptocurrencies will not be those of tomorrow, but their impact on the market is beyond question. However, as the adoption of blockchain technology and digital money rages on, tomorrow's finance may well be shaped by problems encountered by these leading cryptos.

"""Sustainably"" Surveilling & Tokenizing Nature: The Case of O.N.E. Amazon "" Sons of Liberty Media",https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/sustainably-surveilling-tokenizing-nature-the-case-of-o-n-e-amazon/,2024-08-31,Sons of Liberty Media,"The architect of BlackRock's ETFs has teamed up with a group of companies tied to US intelligence and US government debt trading to tokenize the Amazon rainforest and borgify it with a large-scale sensor network in order to create a new form of ""digital gold.""

A satellite surveillance company with links to U.S. intelligence, former Trump administration officials, U.S. government debt barons and the stablecoin Tether (USDT) announced plans earlier this year to build the ""Internet for Forests"" in the Amazon rainforest. The satellite company, called Satellogic, plans to join an initiative to rig up one of the world's oldest and most important forests with sensors and ""machine intelligence infrastructure"" led by a group called O.N.E. Amazon. O.N.E. Amazon, in turn, seeks to turn the Amazon rainforest into a digital asset security to be chopped up, tokenized and sold off to investors around the world as a novel form of digital credit. O.N.E. Amazon's partners in this endeavor, such as Aecom, also have important U.S. intelligence connections.

O.N.E. Amazon is chaired by Peter Knez, who oversaw the creation of ETFs (exchange traded funds) and iShares, which is now owned by BlackRock. Knez, who also served for many years as BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Officer, also chairs the Venom Foundation, which is developing a proprietary blockchain and token to facilitate the ""development and implementation of central bank digital currency (CBDC) and traditional finance products by governments and businesses"" around the world. Given that O.N.E. Amazon describes its rainforest tokenization initiative as ""crypto with a purpose"" and that it is also chaired by Knez, it seems likely that the Amazon-focused initiative may involve Venom in some capacity. Given Satellogic's ties to past efforts to impose a Bitcoin blockchain-powered carbon market on Latin America, it is also possible that Bitcoin or another prominent blockchain will be used, especially considering the involvement of Jalak Jobanputra, a major investor in the digital currency space and particularly in important Bitcoin-related companies, in allegedly co-founding O.N.E. Amazon.

As we previously reported earlier this year in a piece entitled Tokenized Inc., BlackRock and other titans of finance are attempting to tokenize and financialize the natural world. Considering that the architect of iShares now stands at the helm of O.N.E. Amazon, it is important to reflect on BlackRock's Larry Fink's words shortly after the approval of the iShares Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. Fink stated that ""We believe ETFs are a technology no different than Bitcoin was a technology for asset storage."" In other words, blockchain and ETFs, per Fink, merely serve as a technological means to store centralized indexes, funds and tokenized assets, in direct contrast to the founding aspirations of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. Now, the very man who developed BlackRock's ETF machine is seeking to tokenize the Amazon rainforest and transform it into a digital asset of finite supply - essentially turning a major and crucial ecosystem into a ""digital gold"" or bitcoin analogue.

For years, titans of Wall Street like BlackRock have helped saddle South American countries with unprecedented debt levels, robbing them of their economic sovereignty through dollarization or institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Now, they are seeking to turn the continent's most crucial resources into a form of ""digital gold"" that will be enforced by a satellite-sensor system tied to individuals deeply invested in efforts to globalize dollar-denominated debt and also to American intelligence. While the goal is framed as ""conservation"" of the Amazon, the Satellogic-O.N.E. Amazon proposal seeks instead to enable the exploitation of a protected resource like never before while also building a cybernetic surveillance grid into one of nature's greatest monuments - not to ensure the forest's ""health"" - but to ensure the ""integrity"" of the digital asset security it is now poised to uphold.

O.N.E. Amazon aims to create ""sustainable impact for the environment and investors by using next-generation technology to bring innovation to conservation."" It was formally launched at COP28 in December 2023 but appears to have begun operations sometime around 2021, if not earlier. The ""innovation"" O.N.E. Amazon offers is related to its issuance of an upcoming,""regulated O.N.E. Amazon Digital Asset Security."" Per O.N.E. Amazon's chairman Peter Knez, ""each security will represent the perceived value of one hectare of biome in the Amazon rainforest, backed by a 30-year preservation agreement over that land."" The amount of securities to be issued will be capped at 750 million, ""corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest."" In other words, each security issued represents one hectare of the Amazon. Knez stated in an interview with TradeArabia that the group has already secured ""an impressive long-term land preservation agreement for 50 million hectares of rainforest, an area larger than Spain."" The company asserts that ""investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the security"" in large part due to ""the finite size"" of the rainforest it is tokenizing.

Proceeds from purchases of this security will go to the O.N.E. Amazon Impact Found (OAIF), which is headquartered Abu Dhabi, UAE and ""will create jobs for the local Amazonian communities and accelerate the energy transition of the countries through which the Amazon rainforest extends."" At its COP28 launch, O.N.E. Amazon, along with the OAIF, was described as ""the world's first trillion-dollar nature-based asset platform."" Goldman Sachs is the ""structuring partner"" for the fund. The company has also stated that this fund ""will invest in energy transition and circular economy projects, including infrastructure and clean energy generation projects, in addition to more localised community land preservation projects in the Amazon."" It also purports to ""better the lives"" of the millions who inhabit the region.

However, as we shall soon see, O.N.E. Amazon's efforts to-date in the Amazon show that the group, despite claiming to champion ecosystem preservation and indigenous well-being, have acted predatorily with respect to indigenous Amazonian tribes. They are also backing major industrial projects in the countries it operates that do not benefit the local people or environment, arguably the opposite.

In order to help underwrite their digital asset security linked to each hectare of the Amazon rainforest, O.N.E. Amazon plans to build the ""world's first Internet of Forest (IoF)"" in partnership with MIT Media Lab and the aforementioned satellite surveillance company, Satellogic. A percentage of the OAIF will go toward building out the IoF and other investments in Amazon ""data enablement."" MIT Media Lab is specifically helping O.N.E. Amazon create ""a framework to monitor every hectare that is tokenized against a Digital Asset Security"" that will also ""provide a data-driven, real-time understanding of what's happening the Amazon biome."" On its website, O.N.E. Amazon states that the IoF will ""monitor and analyze the health"" of the rainforest while also ""digitally connect[ing] every hectare of land."" According to O.N.E. Amazon co-founder and CEO Rodrigo Veloso, a former board member of Trump Media & Technology Group:

""The Internet of Forests is intended to ensure reliable measurements of key environmental and social metrics; serve as world - class data collection and storage infrastructure for scientific analysis of forest environments; and enable local communities to better understand how their behavior and the behavior of institutions impact the natural environment within the rainforest.""

Chris Lang, contributing editor of the REDD-Monitor substack, revealed in a 2023 report that O.N.E. Amazon has sought to trademark the ""Internet of Forests"" concept since 2021 and that the trademark is intended to cover the following:

""Software as a service; electronic data storage; database development; data analysis and processing; information / data processing; research on agroforestry and agroecological systems; research activities, including the use of apparatus and instruments for activities related to the operation of monitoring and measuring forestry and lands; scanning; advice and consultancy in carrying out tests and measurements for quality control; measurement and verification of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases; aero photogrammetry; photogrammetry; land surveying; topographic surveys; geological surveys; environmental control of air and noise pollution; research in the field of environmental protection; geological research; biological research; providing scientific information, advice and consultancy relating to carbon offsetting; development of technical projects on agroforestry and agroecological systems.""

Given the mentions of carbon dioxide emissions and carbon offsetting, it seems clear that the O.N.E. Amazon security and the ""Internet of Forests"" underwriting it intends to integrate into the broader efforts to impose carbon markets globally. As noted in previous reporting, Latin America has been a major focus for ""green"" bankers and financiers in this regard and O.N.E. Amazon, like groups like GREEN+, are using deeply inequitable contractual agreements made at the local level to implement their plans. The O.N.E. Amazon contracts will be discussed in later detail shortly.

In addition, in a research paper published earlier this year in April, O.N.E. Amazon co-founders Peter Knez and Rodrigo Veloso joined O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea and Mysten Labs to develop an approach where blockchain technology could be integrated into ""biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts."" The paper, entitled ""Preserving Nature's Ledger: Blockchains in Biodiversity Conservation,"" promotes a framework that focuses on ""tokenization strategies for biodiversity species and for IoT solutions, such as sensors, drones, and satellites to monitor and record data related to species and ecosystems.""

The paper notes that the biodiversity data obtained under this framework could be used to develop new green bonds and derivatives that could be traded on a blockchain. To accomplish this, they propose the ""datafication of biodiversity,"" which they define as ""the process of creating digital representations of various species in the ecosystem. They also propose ""data repurposing cascades,"" which refers to ""the process of reusing collected biodiversity data for various purposes [...] that are not necessarily and directly connected to conservation efforts,"" i.e. commercializing the biodiversity data they obtain. One example given later on relates to how ""all collected data can be used to create AI training sets aimed at identifying and resolving threats to biodiversity."" That example claims that the data could be used to train an AI that deploys ""swarm intelligence drones that are in contact with sensor on the ground"" to ""manage threats and shocks to biodiversity.""

The paper fails to establish how these ""innovations"" will actually promote and protect biodiversity. The paper merely says in its conclusion that ""the results of leveraging [biodiversity] data will hopefully help in biodiversity preservation via sustainable digital technology investments"" (emphasis added). It seems likely that these technology investments allude to the expansion of the sensor network and the Internet of Forests, which appears to be much more about surveilling the natural world and turning it into a financial asset than actually promoting biodiversity, as well as the the aforementioned use of ""swarm intelligence drones"" to ""manage"" biodiversity.

Notably, Mysten Labs, which co-authored the paper with O.N.E. Amazon's co-founders, is deeply tied to the Peter Thiel and DARPA-linked social media network Facebook and its efforts to make its own digital currency. Mysten Labs was founded in September 2021 by four former members of Meta/Facebook's stablecoin project Libra, also known as Diem and Novi Financial. Evan Cheng, co-founder and CEO was previously the head of Research and Development at Novi Financial, while Sam Blackshear, another co-founder and the CTO of Mysten Labs, was previously the Chief Engineer at Novi, having contributed significantly to the creation of the MOVE programming language used by Libra/Diem while at Meta. The founding team also includes Adeniyi Abiodun and George Danezis, key contributors to Diem's stablecoin and the aforementioned MOVE programming language -- the language now employed by Mysten Lab's blockchain, Sui.

Though past efforts of O.N.E. Amazon have involved collaborations with groups like the aforementioned Mysten Labs, the only ""official"" partners it lists on its website include MIT Media Lab, Satellogic, Aecom and Veea. The latter three have significant connections to the U.S. government, namely the U.S. military and intelligence community.

MIT Media Lab was previously the force behind the creation of the Digital Currency Initiative, which partnered with the U.S. Federal Reserve on assessing the feasibility of a U.S. dollar CBDC (that effort is known as Project Hamilton). It is also known for its prior yet very deep financial relationship with sex trafficker of minors, currency speculator and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein, who not only funded MIT Media Lab and cultivated a close relationship with its former head Joi Ito, but also brought in other major donors like Bill Gates and Leon Black. Epstein was extremely interested in cryptocurrency and previously invited crypto pioneer Brock Pierce to his island to speak on cryptocurrency. Pierce would later create the dollar stablecoin Tether (USDT) along with William Quigley, a long-time business partner of Bill Elkus, a former trustee of the J. Epstein Foundation and founding partner of Idealab, the first institutional investor in PayPal. MIT Media Lab appears to not have publicly commented on its partnership with O.N.E. Amazon.

The other partner of O.N.E. Amazon in its IoF project is Satellogic. Satellogic was recently the recipient of $30 million investment from Tether (USDT) and Howard Lutnick, the long-time CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald - the custodian of much of Tether's U.S. Treasuries, sits on the board. Lutnick and Cantor both hold 23.9% each of Satellogic shares, for a combined 47.8%. Lutnick was recently named co-chair of Donald Trump's transition team, where he will help Trump choose cabinet and other executive appointments if Trump's 2024 election bid is successful. Satellogic's board is also chaired by Steve Mnuchin, Trump's former Treasury Secretary who helped implement BlackRock's ""Going Direct"" plan months before and throughout the Covid-19 crisis. ""Going Direct"" put the bulk of money printed for economic relief intended to mitigate the effects of lockdown policies on regular Americans into the hands of Wall Street giants like BlackRock. BlackRock, whose head Larry Fink was tapped by Trump to develop the government's fiscal response to the crisis, used much of that money to buy shares in their own ETFs. The former Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. military under Trump, Joseph Dunford, is also on the board of Satellogic.

Aside from its board, Satellogic's co-founders, Emiliano Kargieman and Gerardo Richarte, were long-time contractors for DARPA, the NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies prior to founding Satellogic. Kargieman recently stated that the company's investment from Tether would help Satellogic advance more easily into the U.S. ""National Security market,"" i.e. intelligence contracts. Tether itself onboarded the FBI, the U.S.' domestic intelligence agency, and Secret Service onto its platform last year, allowing them to surveil and seize Tether from wallets deemed unfriendly by the U.S. government.

In addition, Satellogic, as we reported in Debt From Above, was also a key partner in an effort called GREEN+, which seeks to use satellite surveillance to turn Latin America's protected areas into tokenized carbon credits to be traded on the Bitcoin side-chain Rootstock (RSK) and to finance industrial projects that would construct an inter-continental ""smart grid"" digitally linking the Americas.

Satellogic isn't the only concerning firm partnered with O.N.E. Amazon. Another partner, Aecom, is the successor to the CIA-linked Ashland Oil and currently contracts extensively with USAID, widely believed to be a CIA front organization. In the 1970s, Ashland Oil pled guilty to multiple counts of making illegal domestic campaign contributions, which later became part of the Watergate scandal, and of bribing government officials in several countries. During this same period, Ashland was revealed to be a recipient of large amounts of CIA funds for ""undisclosed purposes,"" roughly half of which were paid in cash. Ashland, the CIA and the SEC all refused to comment on the nature of these payments. The Washington Post also reported in the late 1970s that the CIA had used Ashland Oil as ""a cover for an agent operating abroad."" In addition, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ashland Oil played a central role in a number of scandals that involved CIA veterans operating in Oman and Libya. Those veterans worked on behalf of what was known as the ""private CIA"" created during the Carter administration by Ted Shackley, the CIA's ""blonde ghost,"" and former CIA covert operations officer Thomas Clines. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, the ""private CIA"" cabal initiated what would become known as the Iran-Contra scandal and its members, including Clines, would become its main conspirators. The same group would later help give rise to Jeffrey Epstein and the networks that enabled his sexual and financial misdeeds.

The subsidiary of Ashland that would become Aecom, Ashland Technology, was formed in 1985, when Ashland was still steeped in clandestine intelligence ties. It was formally spun off in 1990, forming Aecom. Aecom, which now describes itself as an infrastructure firm serving governments, businesses and organizations, acquired long-time USAID, World Bank and Ford Foundation contractor PADCO (Planning and Development Collaborative International). It subsequently acquired a PADCO competitor, The Services Group, and launched Aecom International Development, making the company a major contractor to USAID. The Ford Foundation has long-standing connections to the CIA and USAID itself is widely believed to itself be a CIA front (see here, here, here and here). One of Aecom's partners on USAID contracts, the Nature Conservancy, is deeply connected to the efforts to financialize nature and use ""debt-for-nature"" or ""debt-for-climate"" swaps to force national governments in the Global South to implement certain policies favored by Nature Conservancy stakeholders, such as J.P. Morgan. Notably, a document provided by O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea to the SEC, claims that USAID is directly involved in O.N.E. Amazon's efforts along with unspecified ""UN agencies.""

Veea is a major developer of ""smart city"" technology that is pioneering the creep of those technologies into rural areas and farms. They are also a major provider of 5G technology. They have a deep relationship with U.S. military contractor Qualcomm, which describes itself as ""the driving force behind the development, launch and expansion of 5G."" Veea is one of Qualcomm's main partners in that endeavor. For instance, Veea is part of Qualcomm's Rural Cloud Initiative, which seeks to use 5G connectivity to ""digitally transform"" rural areas and agriculture through developing its AI-powered ""FarmGrid solution."" Veea is also part of Qualcomm's Smart Cities Accelerator Program. Veea is also a major provider of technology aimed at deploying the ""metaverse"" and augmented reality wearables. For example, last year, they announced a merger with augmented reality hardware producer Ostendo Technologies. As will be noted later, Peter Knez's venture before O.N.E. Amazon, the Venom Foundation, was also pushing into the metaverse. Ostendo is backed by the U.S. military's DARPA and Peter Thiel, who co-founded the deeply CIA-linked data-mining firm Palantir. Thiel is intimately connected to Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance and previously played a significant role in Trump's transition team during his first term in addition to being a major donor to Trump in the 2016 election. Ostendo has also worked as a contractor for the U.S. intelligence community's DARPA-equivalent IARPA.

Veea provides the hardware that links together the Internet of Forests (IoF) sensors, which were developed by MIT media Lab and ""others."" It states that building the IoF will occur in 5 phases, beginning with data infrastructure, followed by satellite and drone-provided imagery. The subsequent phases involve ""environmental sensing,"" ""socio-environmental sensing"" which appears to refer to surveilling the activities of locals living in the surveilled areas, and finally ""bio-sensing"" that will provide ""molecule-level insights.""

Veea frames the IoF project as ultimately leading toward an ""AI-driven neural network for our planet."" The effort to develop that neural network, framed as being founded on the ""principle that all species and ecosystems on this planet are part of a single system,"" are already underway. Called ""Enterprise Neurosystem,"" the goal is to ""link all the relevant climate networks and data sources"" for ""climate projects"" around the world into ""a single open AI framework"" and ""conduct a higher order analysis across all points of reference in real time."" This ""AI neurosystem"" would span the entire planet and its partners include not only Veea, but Microsoft, Google, Meta/Facebook, IBM, Intel and Yahoo!, among others. In other words, the IoF of O.N.E. Amazon is intended to eventually span every forest, everywhere, with major implications for nature and society.

In September 2022, O.N.E. Amazon signed an agreement with the indigenous organization FICSH, which represents the Shuar people of the Ecuadorian Amazon. FICSH, after reading the agreement more carefully, voted to cancel the agreement with O.N.E. Amazon just a few months later in early February 2023. Regional activist groups like Acción Ecológica have noted that the contract signed dramatically favored the interests of O.N.E. Amazon and put the Shuar at a major disadvantage.

For example, the surveillance systems placed in the forest as part of the agreement, i.e. systems like the Internet of Forests, would be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, and the company could use any type of surveillance device in Shuar territory and pass that data along to anyone they choose without oversight. In addition, any development or conservation project in Shuar territory related to the agreement are to also be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon and the company also possesses final authority over what private businesses or NGOs can enter Shuar territory to execute those projects.

The Shuar are also expected to help facilitate the surveillance of its territories by both the sensor network and by satellite, i.e. Satellogic, and those that ultimately purchase the O.N.E. Amazon digital asset security are also enabled to ""observe"" the Shuar's land via satellite per the contract. The proceeds from the sale from the security derived from Shuar land are also to be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, with the Shuar only entitled to 15% of the profits that O.N.E. Amazon and its OAIF custody. The contract says the Shuar would receive half of their money within 30 days after the sale concludes and the remaining half would be disbursed annually over the remaining 30 year duration of the contract.

In addition, only O.N.E. Amazon can unilaterally cancel the agreement, meaning that the Shuar's rapid change of opinion in the contractual agreement could see them still wait decades before they are actually free of its terms. It also opens up the possibility that O.N.E. Amazon could cancel the contracts after selling its securities but before the 30 days they have to pay the Shuar their half of their meager share of the sales. Ultimately, as REDD-Monitor's Chris Lang noted, O.N.E. Amazon's contract with the Shuar ""would result in a panopticon-level of surveillance over"" their territory, give O.N.E. Amazon control over the monetization of that data, allow O.N.E. Amazon to choose what businesses can enter into and act upon Shuar territory without Shuar consent, and allow O.N.E. Amazon to make almost all of the money. O.N.E. Amazon seems to have secured the signing of this deeply inequitable contract by paying Shuar leadership $10,000 followed by $90,000 once the contract was signed. Yet, given what the Shuar have lost and stand to lose - and what O.N.E. Amazon stands to gain - $100,00 is next to nothing.

In addition to their past contracts with the Shuar, there is also the partnership between the Colombian government and O.N.E. Amazon to consider. O.N.E. Amazon, which no longer publicly discusses its past controversy with the Shuar, instead highlights their partnership with the government of Colombia and how the OAIF will be investing in ""energy transition and circular economy projects"" which will ostensibly benefit both the local environment and local inhabitants.

For instance, the proposed OAIF-funded project in Ciénaga involves a ""clean energy"" port and industrial park as well as two offshore wind projects to be placed off the coast of the Ciénaga port. The offshore wind projects will be entirely owned by BlueFloat, a Spanish offshore wind company. BlueFloat is a portfolio company of 547 energy, which itself is part of the Houston-based Quantum Energy Partners (now Quantum Capital). Quantum, traditionally focused on the oil and gas sector, has - since 2021 - been investing very heavily in carbon capture and carbon market infrastructure companies and it was reported in June 2024 that Quantum has been attempting to sell its stake in BlueFloat for €500 million.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, the Environmental Impact Assessments for the offshore wind projects will be performed by USAID contractor and O.N.E. Amazon partner Aecom. The bulk of the power generated by this plant will not go toward powering local communities but instead will mainly power the Ciénaga industrial park including the Ciénaga desalination and ""green"" hydrogen production plant as well as the proposed Ciénaga ""green"" mineral processing zone, which will process raw minerals from Chile and Argentina (likely lithium) and other South American countries. The area of Ciénaga, per O.N.E. Amazon, has 2000 hectares of industrial ""development potential.""

In addition, as noted by O.N.E. Amazon, the ""stakeholders"" they have engaged with respect to the offshore wind project does not include local inhabitants, indigenous groups or environmental activists. Instead, it includes ""authorities in key [Colombian government] institutions involved in the project"" as well as the British and Spanish embassies, which O.N.E. Amazon says are ""closely collaborat[ing]"" on the projects. It also states that there have been ""discussions"" with the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank, defined by the U.S. military as ""financial weapons"" of U.S. government power, about ""potential support schemes"" for the projects.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, locals who will benefit from these projects will merely be those employed as ""workers, maintenance personnel and [other employed] possibly in related activities such as transportation and logistics."" The proposed projects at Ciénaga will ""benefit"" indigenous tribes by ""conserving"" the ""black line"" (línea negra) that separates indigenous territory from non-indigenous territory.

In addition to Ciénaga, O.N.E. Amazon is backing the production of biocrude from agricultural biomass. The end result of the biocrude produced will be for the aviation industry, as it is intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The plants will be run and operated (and presumably owned) by two foreign companies - the Dutch company BTG Bioliquids and Alder Fuels (now Alder Renewables). BTG and Alder are partners.

Alder was founded by Bryan Sherbacrow, who embezzled $5.9 million from Alder and was sentenced to 3 years in prison this past June. In January 2023, shortly before Sherbacrow was removed from his role as CEO, Alder received millions from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop its SAF production process, which has also been tested at the DoE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ""with support from the U.S. Defense and Logistics Agency,"" part of the U.S. military. Alder is also seeking to use ""blockchain technology tools to account for all the emissions claims from the use of the SAF"" in order to ""generate the necessary records and transparency for compliance with regulatory frameworks, ESG standards and other sustainability commitments."" This will directly enable the functionality of carbon markets as it relates to air travel.

In summary, the O.N.E. Amazon's OAIF-funded projects in Colombia profiled above are industrial projects that will greatly benefit foreign companies and are being closely developed with foreign governments (like the UK and Spain) as well as entities that are funded by or are contractors for the U.S. government. Their ""environmental"" benefits are dubious and, while it would create industrial hubs that could theoretically generate economic growth for the population, the bulk of the infrastructure will be owned by foreign companies, which also receive the vast majority of the profits that result from these projects.

O.N.E. Amazons's sole known funder is Starlight Ventures, which funds companies that produce ""transformative technologies to fix the world."" Its other investments focus mainly on biotechnology, lab-grown meat, carbon market infrastructure, autonomous mining vehicles and space-related technologies, especially satellite surveillance firms. The firm was co-founded by Patricia Wexler, a Venezuelan-American businesswoman who previously worked with top Disney executives and then Elevation Partners, a significant investor in Facebook, Uber and other prominent tech companies.

Starlight Ventures also has ties to the Endeavor Network, which is deeply embedded in Latin America - particularly its cryptocurrency infrastructure - and is heavily funded by the controversial Bronfman family and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay and owner of PayPal from 2002 to 2015. For instance, one of its three venture partners is Santiago Bilinkis, one of the earliest fixtures in the Endeavor Network who - among other things - first connected Wences Casares, the founder of Xapo Bank, with Endeavor's Linda Rottenberg. Bilinkis later co-founded Wanako Games with Casares and has served on Endeavor's board of directors. Bilinkis is still involved with Endeavor's Argentina branch, serving on its Council of Founders alongside Argentine oligarchs like Eduardo Elzstain, host of the Bilderberg-style Llao Llao Forum in Bariloche, Argentina. Starlight also invests in some Endeavor-backed companies, like Satellogic, which is also considerably connected to Endeavor's Argentina branch.

According to an older profile written by Starlight Ventures about O.N.E. Amazon and cited by Acción Ecologica, an investor named Jalak Jobanputra is named the third co-founder of O.N.E. Amazon. Jobanputra, before founding her VC firm Future Perfect Ventures, was the director of Emerging Market Mobile Investments for Pierre Omidyar's the Omidyar Network and also previously worked for Intel and Lehman Brothers. While at the Omidyar Network, Jobanputra closed ""Omidyar's largest for profit investment ($5M) to date in Latin America, a wireless company that created credit profiles on unbanked middle income consumers using mobile data.""

It was reportedly during her time at the Omidyar Network that Jobanputra became interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrency. More specifically, it was her ""time spent in Africa analyzing the growth of the mobile money services platform M-Pesa,"" which led her to believe that crypto and bitcoin adoption were more likely to succeed in emerging markets. However, Jobanputra links adoption of these technologies to having a digital ID ""that you [can] have different assets associated with and can transact with."" Notably, the Omidyar Network is a long-time funder of technologies that enable CBDC issuance as well as Digital ID. In addition, through Endeavor, the Omidyar Network backs the biggest companies in Latin America's fintech space, effectively dominating the payment rails for crypto and bitcoin and therefore centralizing control over them and neutering the supposed ""decentralizing"" effects of cryptocurrency and bitcoin adoption.

In Jobanputra's case, her current VC firm has invested in a variety of crypto companies including BitGo, Blockstream and Celo. BitGo was founded by Mike Belshe, a big supporter of Trump VP pick JD Vance, alongside Ben Davenport and has previously custodied the U.S. government's bitcoin. Blockstream is fundamentally connected to Bitcoin Core and, thus, has played an outsized role in most of the past major updates made on the Bitcoin network, making them so important to that network that Endeavor's Reid Hoffman once suggested they would be the Microsoft or Google of blockchain (Hoffman is a key member of the Endeavor network and ""PayPal Mafia,"" and was previously a Blockstream board member and is also a major Blockstream investor). Celo is a ""mobile first,"" ""carbon neutral"" blockchain with a major focus on ""scaling voluntary carbon markets"" and stablecoins. Its investors include Reid Hoffman, Jack Dorsey and Coinbase Ventures. Celo has a particularly important relationship with Circle's dollar stablecoin USDC, which Coinbase's Brian Armstrong once suggested would become the U.S.' de facto CBDC. Circle and USDC are deeply connected to BlackRock, with BlackRock holding a minority stake in Circle, Circle's USDC being used to convert shares of BlackRock's first tokenized fund BUIDL into digital dollars, and the Circle Reserve Fund being managed by BlackRock.

O.N.E. Amazon co-founder Peter Knez began his career at Goldman Sachs as a Quantitive Research Associate, before joining Barclays' BGI as their Chief Investment Officer. While employed at Barclays, Knez personally oversaw the creation of their iShares brand, an essential pillar in the proliferation of the now-dominant ETF market. In a conversation with Nasdaq, Knez claimed that ""ETFs really only started with iShares at BGI."" According to Knez, ""there was a simple reason for developing it: we were the largest institutional asset manager without a mutual fund product and wanted to expand into retail."" The iShares ETFs ""allowed us to enter the retail market and compete with Mutual Funds"" by ""replicating existing indexes with a product that traded on exchanges, while disclosing their holding on a daily basis and delivering liquidity and transparency in a tax efficient format.""

Due to global collateral damage during the 2008 financial crisis, BGI was eventually acquired by BlackRock in 2009, who took the iShares brand to new heights, including the fastest growing ETF in history, the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF. When asked about BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, Knez implied ""we are in the early innings of the 'institutional' regime in cryptocurrencies and blockchain as the Wild West regime ends,"" and later described this institutional regime as ""characterized by increased participation of institutions like BlackRock and by governments"" while noting incoming ""legislation providing a regulatory framework for digital assets"" within the United States. Knez further claims that ""BlackRock wants to participate in this regulatory momentum"" and stated his believe that ""BlackRock will ultimately succeed"" due to their ""excellent track record"" while articulating suspicions that CEO Larry Fink ""would not have gone public if it was not pre-approved.""

Knez, however, has stated that Bitcoin as a speculative asset is less important than the underlying blockchain technology:

""My view is Bitcoin is to blockchain much like search or pornography was to the internet. It drove early adoption, but the underlying technology is much more important. Technologies that remove important frictions and improve benefit for society, those are the ones that persist. Blockchain, in my view, is such a technology, and the institutions believe it, too. I've talked to BlackRock, I had lunch today with very senior people at Morgan Stanley, they believe it too. And they're preparing for it. They're preparing for it because they know it's a quantum leap and they know they have to be in this game they cannot stand on the sidelines.""

In a conversation with CertiK, Knez noted that this imminent transformation was why he ""couldn't resist getting involved."" He later made reference to his former Goldman Sachs boss, Fischer Black, best known as one of the authors of the Black-Scholes equation, who ""started option pricing"" and ""created the whole notion of synthetic replication."" According to Knez, ""tokenization of real world assets is as big, or bigger than that"" and will ""dramatically change the way assets are managed"":

""Once you tokenize it, you can trade it. Once you can trade, it you can index it. Once you index, it you can write synthetics on it. That's transformative in a way that's never been transformed ever...The reason you see guys like Larry Fink pushing tokenization now is, for one, that Aladdin's about to have the functionality he wants for his clients. [And] number two, there's not a lot of alternatives to go scale the business. This is a way for the large institutions, whether it's Morgan Stanley or BlackRock or the other asset managers, this is a way for them to scale their business. And so that's why I think it's inevitable.""

In line with these beliefs, Knez participated in the launch of a new layer one blockchain, Venom, and alongside it founded the Venom Foundation in 2020. Other Venom Foundation members include Mustafa Kheriba, the Executive Chairman of Iceberg Capital; Dr. Kai-Uwe Steck, manager of Pontinova Circle Investment Group; Osman Sultan, the former CEO of DU Telecom and Founder of Fikratech; and Shahal M. Khan, Founder of Burkhan World, Trinity Hospitality Holdings and the CEO of Burtech. In August 2023, the Venom Foundation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United Arab Emirates Government to ""develop and implement the National Carbon Credit System"" in preparation of the country hosting COP28 that November. ""Venom Foundation has provided an unparalleled solution, acting as a key infrastructure for a global ecosystem for Web3 applications, with superfast transaction speeds and unlimited scalability to meet governments' needs."" Knez explained that the foundation is ""the first company in the UAE to develop and licence its blockchain technology and shape the future of national decentralised systems and digitise operations in corporate and government enterprises."" The MOU further covers ""green investment,"" ""adaptation to climate change,"" ""reducing carbon emissions,"" ""preparing and implementing a climate neutrality strategy,"" while ""enhancing partnership opportunities with the private sector.""

Knez expressed his excitement upon the signing of the MOU, commenting that the foundation is ""honored and excited to join hands with the UAE Government to build the National Carbon Credit System."" The press release claims that this was ""a revolutionary collaboration"" which demonstrates ""the UAE's unwavering commitment to bolstering transparency, reliability, and efficiency in carbon emission management"" via ""the next generation blockchain technology of Venom"" which boasts being ""carbon neutral."" Knez, the chair of the foundation, had previously told Nasdaqthat Venom was ""focused on three primary projects: stablecoins, carbon credits, and commodities"" and furthered that ""with respect to stablecoins"" the foundation was ""involved with governments and commercial banks in countries both in Africa and Asia."" Knez believes the ""combination of blockchain and smart contracts"" will ""profoundly transform financial services"" in the ensuing decade. ""They will be unrecognizable, as almost every core function in financial services will be transformed.""

In order to advance this transformation, the Venom Foundation partnered with Iceberg Capital, led by Venom foundation member Mustafa Kheriba, in January 2023 to form the Venom Ventures Fund (VVF). The goal of the VVF was to create ""a ten-figure war chest"" with $1 billion dedicated to ""accelerating the adoption of blockchain, DeFi, and web3 in MENA and beyond."" Knez was chosen to chair the venture, while readying ""strategic investments"" to ""transform digital asset management"" via the ""ideal platform for us to achieve this goal,"" the Venom blockchain. Interestingly, both the Venom Foundation and Iceberg Capital currently operate within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a ""fast-growing financial center situated in the heart of the UAE's capital."" It was founded a decade ago to ""promote entrepreneurship throughout the United Arab Emirates and the wider MENA region."" Venom had previously been granted ""a formal license to issue utility tokens by ADGM"" and according to Forbes, became ""the first blockchain to come under government agency control"" and to be ""monitored by a regulatory body.""

According to reporting from The Block, at the time of its announcement, the fund said it had led a $20 million investment in Nümi Metaverse and the next January announced a $5 million investment in Layer 1 blockchain Everscale, while ""no deals have been announced since."" In a December 2023 tweet, the Venom Foundation announced they will ""no longer continue operating in ADGM and in accordance with section 40 of the regulations, the Foundation has initiated the dissolution process.""

While there is little to show for the $1 billion fund launched in 2023, just last week, Venom announced a ""historic agreement with the government of the Republic of the Philippines"" in order to ""digitize billions of accountable forms using its advanced blockchain technology"" in ""what could end up as the world's largest blockchain use case,"" according to reporting from Gulf News.

Christopher Louis Tsu, the CEO of Venom Foundation, called Venom's selection by the Republic of the Philippines a ""testament to our platform's capabilities and the trust placed in our technology."" He furthered noted that ""by digitizing checks using Venom blockchain, we are not only reducing printing and processing costs but also significantly enhancing transparency and efficiency in financial operations"" demonstrating ""the massive utilization of the Venom blockchain in the form of hundreds of millions of Venom tokens annually"" while showcasing their ""commitment to delivering scalable, secure, and innovative solutions for national-level applications.""

These aspirations for further institutional and nation-state adoption of blockchain was seemingly echoed by Knez in a discussion with CoinTelegraph in March 2023:

""It is the early innings of the institutionalization of Web3. It's early innings, but it's going to happen... If you want to attract institutional money, you're going to have to seek regulation... The era of the Wild West is ending, which I think is good for everybody. So I advise them to to embrace the institutionalization, as that's what time it is.""

Now, with O.N.E. Amazon, it appears clear that Knez is seeking to again partner with major governments to tokenize real world assets, in this case the natural world, and to enable the advancement of a global carbon market/carbon offset economy.

The other co-founder and current CEO of O.N.E. Amazon is Rodrigo Veloso, a Brazilian entrepreneur who developed the O.N.E. Coconut Water brand, later sold to PepsiCo in 2012. That same year he co-founded Brazil's first online insurance company, Segurar.com, though it appears not to have launched until 2013. Around this time, in 2013, Veloso began working at Unik Capital, which operates in both the U.S. and Brazil, and he claims to still work there even though he is not mentioned on the company website. He has also claimed to be the founder of Unik Capital and that he used his funds from selling O.N.E. Coconut Water to Pepsi to do so. However, only CEO Sylvie Proia is listed as the founder on the company's website.

A year after joining Unik Capital, in 2014, Veloso attempted to acquire a decommissioned naval base in Puerto Rico and turn it into a ""mix of Disney World and Las Vegas,"" a ""green city with a focus on entertainment,"" marking his first foray into ""green"" business ventures that would later culminate with his role in co-creating O.N.E. Amazon. In addition to O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso also created another company called O.N.E. Natural Energy that specializes in producing syngas, which can be produced from ""a wide range of carbon-containing substances"" and is used to generate electricity or ""as a building block for a range of desirable commodities, from methanol to gasoline."" O.N.E. Natural Energy currently operates in Brazil.

A few years before creating O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso played an interesting role in the efforts to take Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of the Trump-centric social network Truth Social, public. Beginning in 2021, TMTG planned to merge with Digital World, a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC. The merger ultimately occurred in March of this year. The merger was controversial and fraught with scandals for Digital World. As a consequence of the insider trading allegations and fines from the SEC, former CEO of Digital World Patrick Orlando was fired from that role in March 2023 due to the scandals, though Orlando has sued the new CEO, Eric Swider, alleging Swider had planned a ""coup d'etat"" of Digital World to depose him.

Rodrigo Veloso is a close friend of Orlando's and was a Digital World board member from July 2021 until December 2022. Veloso was also present on a pre-merger call with Trump, while still a board member at Digital World, which later became a key focus of the SEC investigation into Digital World that ended with the SEC suing Orlando (the suit was filed after Orlando was fired from Digital World). The New York Times reported that Veloso was acting as an adviser to Orlando on the call. In addition to the SEC charges against Orlando, Digital World was fined $18 million by the SEC. There have been no allegations of TMTG itself engaging in improper trades or other activities related to charges against Digital World and its past executives. Ultimately, the SPAC merger between TMTG and Digital World added billions to Trump's net worth and allegedly provided a ""financial lifeline"" to the former president. Veloso, in addition to his ties to Orlando and Digital World, was also a board member/director of TMTG itself from September 2021 until December 2022, the same time he resigned from Digital World when the then-Orlando-led company was the subject of several investigations. Notably, during this same period of time (2021-2022), Veloso was laying the groundwork for the formal launch of O.N.E. Amazon, including efforts to trademark the Internet of Forests concept and signing the controversial agreement between O.N.E. Amazon and the Shuar in 2022.

In examining the efforts of O.N.E. Amazon and their recently announced partnership with Satellogic, it is worth dwelling on why a company like Satellogic, which is deeply tied to the stablecoin Tether and the U.S. Treasuries market through its board member Howard Lutnick, might wish to be involved with such an endeavor.

Much like a corporation, the United States government itself has a budget it must finance, partly through taxation of citizens and companies, but mostly via the issuance of new debt sold in the form of government bonds known as Treasuries. These securities are directly issued by the U.S. Treasury with the yield, or rate of the return, effectively set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and its governors via the Federal Funding Rate, commonly referred to as an interest rate. Typically, these bonds yield a higher rate of return the longer the duration for which they are issued. For example, a 30 year Treasury would yield a higher coupon than a 3 month Treasury to incentivize buyers to hold U.S. debt for greater periods of time, giving the government a longer runway to service their debt obligations. On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Committee cut the targeted federal funding rate to 0% due to ""the effects of the coronavirus"" weighing ""on economic activity in the near term"" and thus ""risks to the economic outlook.""

""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the Fed statement said. ""Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected."" Despite the ensuing lockdowns and widespread fear of the virus, President Trump praised the Fed that week, saying in a briefing at the White House that the rate cut ""makes me very happy."" In retrospect, the combination of government-mandated lockdowns and the Fed's aggressive rate cut, with unprecedented financial stimulus being distributed (with heavy profits) with collaboration from private sector stalwarts like BlackRock, systemically changed the financial system not just for the U.S., but the world at large. In fact, the Fed ""struck a deal"" with five other central banks including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, to ""lower their rates"" to ""keep the financial markets functioning normally.""

By printing trillions of dollars of newly issued debt at effectively 0% interest rates while simultaneously shuttering monetary velocity and demand alongside the businesses forced to close by their reactionary legislation, Trump's Treasury, led by current Satellogic board Chair Steve Mnuchin, massively increased the monetary supply and the U.S. government's debt obligations while minimizing the immediate inflationary effects of such stimulus. This unprecedented combination of Fed, Treasury and domestic policies allowed huge profits for the highest wealth bands in the nation, with those closest to the money spigot able to gobble up commodities with freshly printed dollars. Arguably, no company benefited more than BlackRock, having been a chief architect of the ""Going Direct"" plan, which allowed them to use these supposed pandemic relief funds to purchase large swaths of assets including from their own iShares ETF division, having acquired the Knez-led iShares from Barclay's during the 2008 crisis after the bank denied a government bail out of their own.

The same March 2020 week as the rate cuts, Bitcoin crashed to nearly $3000, oil futures went negative, and real estate and stock markets around the world collapsed, offering an unprecedented buying opportunity to those with the capital to take advantage -- namely the recently ""stimulated"" BlackRock. But the U.S. government still needed a buyer of Treasuries and while finding a new place to sink this freshly issued debt, the Fed itself began ""purchasing massive amounts of debt securities,"" a technique utilized during the 2008 crisis known as Quantitive Easing, or QE. As Brookings notes, the Fed aimed to ""restore smooth functioning"" to the ""Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets"" which ""play a critical role in the flow of credit to the broader economy.""

On March 15, 2020, the Fed ""shifted the objective"" of QE to supporting the economy, agreeing to purchase ""at least $500 billion in Treasury securities"" and ""$200 billion in government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities"" over ""the coming months."" A week later, on March 23, 2020, the Fed agreed to make the purchases open-ended, saying it would acquire securities ""in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" and thus ""expanding the stated purpose of the bond buying to include bolstering the economy."" By June 2020, the Fed lowered the rate of purchases to ""at least $80 billion a month in Treasuries"" and ""$40 billion in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities"" for the time being. The Fed again updated its policy in December 2020 to slow these purchases when the economy made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and in November 2021, the Fed began tapering the pace of securities purchases.

By October 2021, Bitcoin had rocketed to nearly $70,000, and alongside it arose a new insatiable buyer of U.S. debt via government-issued securities -- dollar stablecoin issuers, led by Tether and Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald. As previously reported by Unlimited Hangout:

""In the past 18 months, a new high volume net buyer of this debt has appeared in the cryptocurrency industry: stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether or Circle have purchased over $150 billion of U.S. debt -- in the form of securities issued by the Treasury -- in order to ""back"" the issuance of their dollar-pegged tokens with a dollar-denominated asset. For some perspective on the absolutely astounding amount of volume these relatively young and relatively small businesses have gobbled up of U.S. debt, China and Japan, historically the U.S.' largest creditors, hold just under and just over $1 trillion, respectively, in these same debt instruments. Despite only existing for a decade, and despite only surpassing a $10 billion market cap in 2020, this leaves Tether alone at over 10% the Treasuries held by either of the U.S.' largest nation-state creditors.""

While the likes of Tether's USDT, alongside BlackRock-affiliated Circle's USDC and PayPal's PYUSD issued by Paxos, the U.S. has found partners for servicing the $35 trillion of already-issued debt alongside any future government budget as well as the modern evolution of the public-private partnership of capital creation while sustaining dollar hegemony across the globe via surveillable, programmable and seizable private bank currencies. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino previously claimed that Tether froze around $435 million in USDT for the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service on its path to becoming a ""world class partner"" to the U.S. to ""expand dollar hegemony globally.""

Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald, which holds Tether's T-Bills, is ""among the best-known bond trading houses on Wall Street"" and ""one of 25 primary dealers for U.S. Treasuries"" which allows ""direct trade with the Federal Reserve."" A report from September 2023 stated that Tether held $86.4 billion of assets in reserves with a later attestation report showing that USDT is mostly backed by U.S. Treasuries. By July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 5.5%, the ""highest level in 22 years,"" in hopes of making ""borrowing and investing more expensive."" With rates having risen faster than ever in U.S. history from the 0% target reached in March 2020, firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald -- net buyers of short duration securities known as T-Bills - are set to receive high yields with very little risk. In Tether's Q1 2023 Assurance Report, the stablecoin issuer held $81.8 billion with ""the majority of its reserves"" having been ""invested in U.S. Treasury Bills"" with ""all new issuance of tokens"" having ""been invested in U.S. Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo.""

In this same report, the company announced they would ""regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin (BTC)"" via ""utilizing realized profits from its investment strategy,"" which relied predominantly on short duration Treasuries. In Q1 2023, Tether held approximately $1.5 billion in bitcoin. By April 2024, the firm held approximately 75,354 bitcoin, worth nearly $4.5 billion today.

In Ardoino's statement regarding ""the decision to invest in Bitcoin"", the current CEO of Tether noted ""its limited supply"" as a reason for why the asset has ""emerged as a long-term store of value"" complete with ""substantial growth potential."" Whereas the U.S. government via the Treasury can continually issue these securities with no limit via a capped supply, bitcoin the asset has a predetermined issuance schedule, and an eventual total supply of just under 21 million bitcoin. The scarcity innate to bitcoin allows a debt-based financial system like the U.S. dollar system to continue to inflate into the demand inelastic, deflationary monetary policy of bitcoin. Now that the U.S. en masse has emerged, in no small part thanks to BlackRock's iShares IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF, as the world's largest known holder of bitcoin, complete with regulatory blessing from the likes of the DOJ and SEC, the Treasury has found willing market partners in their quest to service their debts and further dollarize the planet.

But it is perhaps within the planet itself that a new method for retaining U.S. dollar hegemony has emerged - the dollar-denominated, limited supply carbon market proposed by O.N.E. Amazon. Far from an unsubstantiated theory, Knez himself states precisely that the Amazon rainforest ""should be valued in the trillions"" and that his company is ""enabling the market to value it as such"" by ""turning it into an advanced digital asset security."" In a discussion with Gulf News, Knez took this one step further in explaining why the tangible parameters of the Amazon's size led to the creation of a limited supply of securities, providing the necessary mechanism to create a dollar-denominated debt sink out of the rainforest upon the security's appreciation:

""At O.N.E. Amazon, we are harnessing the power of the market - the same force that has driven exploitation - to transform it into a tool for conservation. We aim to prove that the Amazon is more valuable alive than dead.

We're not just environmentalists; we're innovators, economists, technologists, and community leaders. Together, we're developing a digital security asset - that represents the intrinsic value of the world's largest rainforest's biome. This isn't just a financial instrument; it's a statement, a commitment to the belief that the Amazon is valuable and ought to be priced. In terms of financial returns, investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the digital security as the market values the positive environmental and social benefits of the rainforest's biome.

Given the finite size of the Amazon rainforest, the total number of securities will be restricted to 750 million, corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest. This creates a limited supply of digital securities."" [emphasis added]

Due to the limited supply of digital securities, O.N.E. Amazon has created an axiom for vast capital appreciation of the asset itself, allowing a further expansion of dollar-denominated liabilities and thus further eventual demand for the dollar's underlying asset: U.S. Treasuries. Knez implies the Amazon should be valued in the trillions, and, much like he did in his role spearheading the iShares ETF brand, has created yet another growth market for the U.S. capital markets to ""quantitively ease"" into. Interestingly, this type of government debt expansion was theorized by RFK Jr.'s former running mate, Nicole Shanahan, in a project she led at Stanford titled ""An Analysis of Carbon Credit Markets as Validation for Climate Supportive Quantitative Easing Using the Blockchain"" described below:

""This project will provide a white paper for a carbon coin that works in tandem with the existing carbon credit (offset) markets. As an active venture investor in carbon credit markets such as Pachama and Joro Technologies, and a major customer of these offsets with my husband Sergey Brin, I will be leveraging the current entrepreneurial ecosystem to identify the economic, policy, and technological requirements to scale a carbon credit coin...While authors and futurists such as Kim Stanley Robinson (author of Ministry of the Future), have focused on the feasibility of governments issuing carbon coins in exchange for carbon sequestration, my argument is that a private market can first be situated to verify the accuracy of the carbon sequestration projects funded by the coin. The government can in turn, have evidence based results by which to sell government treasuries into the carbon coin network.""

These ""evidence based results"" of which Shanahan theorized, as it relates to the O.N.E. Amazon scheme, would presumably be the data provided by their satellite partner, Satellogic. Due to Satellogic's board being Chaired by former Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Cantor Fitzgerald's Lutnick large stake of shares and board position, and their funding by leading dollar-denominated stablecoin issuer Tether, the personnel and wherewithal to create such a debt sink at a time of dire need has been assembled.

As the U.S.' ballooning debt demands further areas to place their newly-issued debt, Knez and O.N.E. Amazon have all but directly proposed making the 750 million hectares of Amazon rainforest exactly that place.

O.N.E. Amazon's stated reasons for its business model - ostensibly ""preserving"" and ""conserving"" the Amazon - reflect a broader effort to frame efforts to centralize control over the global commons and build out a surveillance grid for both people and the planet as the only ""feasible"" means of rescuing the planet from catastrophe. However, as this article has endeavored to show, O.N.E. Amazon's interest is not in helping locals or indigenous groups or even in helping actually conserve the rainforest in the way most would imagine. Instead, the goal is to turn the Amazon rainforest into an exploitative farm - a farm for data that itself can be monetized and tokenized, just like the hectarage of the Amazon itself.

As the architects of Wall Street's new web3 economy search for new ways to store the wealth they have pilfered from the public through organized wealth transfers, more forms of ""digital gold"" will become a necessity. While bitcoin represents one digital store of value, the race is on to tokenize real world assets, especially the natural world and natural resources, in order to perpetuate the debt-based monetary system that has enabled the theft of regular people's wealth for centuries. Framed in altruistic terms of ""helping"" the environment and the have-nots, we are instead witnessing the ""datafication"" of all life both for profit and so that all life - including human beings and the natural world - can be surveilled, eventually down to the molecular level, and then ""managed"" by intelligent machines. Such a paradigm does not represent ""conservation"" or ""preservation,"" but rather the onboarding of our greatest natural treasures onto a system of hi-tech control, with every flutter of a butterfly wing and every branch swaying in the breeze being converted into bits and bytes that predatory bankers can trade and speculate on for profit.

O.N.E. Amazon is more than a company, it represents a model that others are following which seeks to borgify the natural world, and us along with it, claiming to ""harness the market"" to save us all from a vague yet impending doom. However, we and the forests are not being saved, we are being put in chains - forced into a prison without walls where the sensors to be placed on and in the trees and on and in our bodies will connect us to the bankers' blockchain of choice and allow us to be traded or sold, our biological signals and processes monetized for their benefit, and the masses of people, plants and animals on this planet to be ""managed"" by AI-powered machines that they program and control.",https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tokenizing-Nature-e1725115278986.jpg,0.3490196078431373

A satellite surveillance company with links to U.S. intelligence, former Trump administration officials, U.S. government debt barons and the stablecoin Tether (USDT) announced plans earlier this year to build the ""Internet for Forests"" in the Amazon rainforest. The satellite company, called Satellogic, plans to join an initiative to rig up one of the world's oldest and most important forests with sensors and ""machine intelligence infrastructure"" led by a group called O.N.E. Amazon. O.N.E. Amazon, in turn, seeks to turn the Amazon rainforest into a digital asset security to be chopped up, tokenized and sold off to investors around the world as a novel form of digital credit. O.N.E. Amazon's partners in this endeavor, such as Aecom, also have important U.S. intelligence connections.

O.N.E. Amazon is chaired by Peter Knez, who oversaw the creation of ETFs (exchange traded funds) and iShares, which is now owned by BlackRock. Knez, who also served for many years as BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Officer, also chairs the Venom Foundation, which is developing a proprietary blockchain and token to facilitate the ""development and implementation of central bank digital currency (CBDC) and traditional finance products by governments and businesses"" around the world. Given that O.N.E. Amazon describes its rainforest tokenization initiative as ""crypto with a purpose"" and that it is also chaired by Knez, it seems likely that the Amazon-focused initiative may involve Venom in some capacity. Given Satellogic's ties to past efforts to impose a Bitcoin blockchain-powered carbon market on Latin America, it is also possible that Bitcoin or another prominent blockchain will be used, especially considering the involvement of Jalak Jobanputra, a major investor in the digital currency space and particularly in important Bitcoin-related companies, in allegedly co-founding O.N.E. Amazon.

As we previously reported earlier this year in a piece entitled Tokenized Inc., BlackRock and other titans of finance are attempting to tokenize and financialize the natural world. Considering that the architect of iShares now stands at the helm of O.N.E. Amazon, it is important to reflect on BlackRock's Larry Fink's words shortly after the approval of the iShares Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. Fink stated that ""We believe ETFs are a technology no different than Bitcoin was a technology for asset storage."" In other words, blockchain and ETFs, per Fink, merely serve as a technological means to store centralized indexes, funds and tokenized assets, in direct contrast to the founding aspirations of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. Now, the very man who developed BlackRock's ETF machine is seeking to tokenize the Amazon rainforest and transform it into a digital asset of finite supply - essentially turning a major and crucial ecosystem into a ""digital gold"" or bitcoin analogue.

For years, titans of Wall Street like BlackRock have helped saddle South American countries with unprecedented debt levels, robbing them of their economic sovereignty through dollarization or institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Now, they are seeking to turn the continent's most crucial resources into a form of ""digital gold"" that will be enforced by a satellite-sensor system tied to individuals deeply invested in efforts to globalize dollar-denominated debt and also to American intelligence. While the goal is framed as ""conservation"" of the Amazon, the Satellogic-O.N.E. Amazon proposal seeks instead to enable the exploitation of a protected resource like never before while also building a cybernetic surveillance grid into one of nature's greatest monuments - not to ensure the forest's ""health"" - but to ensure the ""integrity"" of the digital asset security it is now poised to uphold.

What is O.N.E. Amazon?

O.N.E. Amazon aims to create ""sustainable impact for the environment and investors by using next-generation technology to bring innovation to conservation."" It was formally launched at COP28 in December 2023 but appears to have begun operations sometime around 2021, if not earlier. The ""innovation"" O.N.E. Amazon offers is related to its issuance of an upcoming,""regulated O.N.E. Amazon Digital Asset Security."" Per O.N.E. Amazon's chairman Peter Knez, ""each security will represent the perceived value of one hectare of biome in the Amazon rainforest, backed by a 30-year preservation agreement over that land."" The amount of securities to be issued will be capped at 750 million, ""corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest."" In other words, each security issued represents one hectare of the Amazon. Knez stated in an interview with TradeArabia that the group has already secured ""an impressive long-term land preservation agreement for 50 million hectares of rainforest, an area larger than Spain."" The company asserts that ""investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the security"" in large part due to ""the finite size"" of the rainforest it is tokenizing.

Proceeds from purchases of this security will go to the O.N.E. Amazon Impact Found (OAIF), which is headquartered Abu Dhabi, UAE and ""will create jobs for the local Amazonian communities and accelerate the energy transition of the countries through which the Amazon rainforest extends."" At its COP28 launch, O.N.E. Amazon, along with the OAIF, was described as ""the world's first trillion-dollar nature-based asset platform."" Goldman Sachs is the ""structuring partner"" for the fund. The company has also stated that this fund ""will invest in energy transition and circular economy projects, including infrastructure and clean energy generation projects, in addition to more localised community land preservation projects in the Amazon."" It also purports to ""better the lives"" of the millions who inhabit the region.

However, as we shall soon see, O.N.E. Amazon's efforts to-date in the Amazon show that the group, despite claiming to champion ecosystem preservation and indigenous well-being, have acted predatorily with respect to indigenous Amazonian tribes. They are also backing major industrial projects in the countries it operates that do not benefit the local people or environment, arguably the opposite.

In order to help underwrite their digital asset security linked to each hectare of the Amazon rainforest, O.N.E. Amazon plans to build the ""world's first Internet of Forest (IoF)"" in partnership with MIT Media Lab and the aforementioned satellite surveillance company, Satellogic. A percentage of the OAIF will go toward building out the IoF and other investments in Amazon ""data enablement."" MIT Media Lab is specifically helping O.N.E. Amazon create ""a framework to monitor every hectare that is tokenized against a Digital Asset Security"" that will also ""provide a data-driven, real-time understanding of what's happening the Amazon biome."" On its website, O.N.E. Amazon states that the IoF will ""monitor and analyze the health"" of the rainforest while also ""digitally connect[ing] every hectare of land."" According to O.N.E. Amazon co-founder and CEO Rodrigo Veloso, a former board member of Trump Media & Technology Group:

""The Internet of Forests is intended to ensure reliable measurements of key environmental and social metrics; serve as world - class data collection and storage infrastructure for scientific analysis of forest environments; and enable local communities to better understand how their behavior and the behavior of institutions impact the natural environment within the rainforest.""

Chris Lang, contributing editor of the REDD-Monitor substack, revealed in a 2023 report that O.N.E. Amazon has sought to trademark the ""Internet of Forests"" concept since 2021 and that the trademark is intended to cover the following:

""Software as a service; electronic data storage; database development; data analysis and processing; information / data processing; research on agroforestry and agroecological systems; research activities, including the use of apparatus and instruments for activities related to the operation of monitoring and measuring forestry and lands; scanning; advice and consultancy in carrying out tests and measurements for quality control; measurement and verification of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases; aero photogrammetry; photogrammetry; land surveying; topographic surveys; geological surveys; environmental control of air and noise pollution; research in the field of environmental protection; geological research; biological research; providing scientific information, advice and consultancy relating to carbon offsetting; development of technical projects on agroforestry and agroecological systems.""

Given the mentions of carbon dioxide emissions and carbon offsetting, it seems clear that the O.N.E. Amazon security and the ""Internet of Forests"" underwriting it intends to integrate into the broader efforts to impose carbon markets globally. As noted in previous reporting, Latin America has been a major focus for ""green"" bankers and financiers in this regard and O.N.E. Amazon, like groups like GREEN+, are using deeply inequitable contractual agreements made at the local level to implement their plans. The O.N.E. Amazon contracts will be discussed in later detail shortly.

In addition, in a research paper published earlier this year in April, O.N.E. Amazon co-founders Peter Knez and Rodrigo Veloso joined O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea and Mysten Labs to develop an approach where blockchain technology could be integrated into ""biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts."" The paper, entitled ""Preserving Nature's Ledger: Blockchains in Biodiversity Conservation,"" promotes a framework that focuses on ""tokenization strategies for biodiversity species and for IoT solutions, such as sensors, drones, and satellites to monitor and record data related to species and ecosystems.""

The paper notes that the biodiversity data obtained under this framework could be used to develop new green bonds and derivatives that could be traded on a blockchain. To accomplish this, they propose the ""datafication of biodiversity,"" which they define as ""the process of creating digital representations of various species in the ecosystem. They also propose ""data repurposing cascades,"" which refers to ""the process of reusing collected biodiversity data for various purposes [...] that are not necessarily and directly connected to conservation efforts,"" i.e. commercializing the biodiversity data they obtain. One example given later on relates to how ""all collected data can be used to create AI training sets aimed at identifying and resolving threats to biodiversity."" That example claims that the data could be used to train an AI that deploys ""swarm intelligence drones that are in contact with sensor on the ground"" to ""manage threats and shocks to biodiversity.""

The paper fails to establish how these ""innovations"" will actually promote and protect biodiversity. The paper merely says in its conclusion that ""the results of leveraging [biodiversity] data will hopefully help in biodiversity preservation via sustainable digital technology investments"" (emphasis added). It seems likely that these technology investments allude to the expansion of the sensor network and the Internet of Forests, which appears to be much more about surveilling the natural world and turning it into a financial asset than actually promoting biodiversity, as well as the the aforementioned use of ""swarm intelligence drones"" to ""manage"" biodiversity.

Notably, Mysten Labs, which co-authored the paper with O.N.E. Amazon's co-founders, is deeply tied to the Peter Thiel and DARPA-linked social media network Facebook and its efforts to make its own digital currency. Mysten Labs was founded in September 2021 by four former members of Meta/Facebook's stablecoin project Libra, also known as Diem and Novi Financial. Evan Cheng, co-founder and CEO was previously the head of Research and Development at Novi Financial, while Sam Blackshear, another co-founder and the CTO of Mysten Labs, was previously the Chief Engineer at Novi, having contributed significantly to the creation of the MOVE programming language used by Libra/Diem while at Meta. The founding team also includes Adeniyi Abiodun and George Danezis, key contributors to Diem's stablecoin and the aforementioned MOVE programming language -- the language now employed by Mysten Lab's blockchain, Sui.

O.N.E. Amazon's Partners

Though past efforts of O.N.E. Amazon have involved collaborations with groups like the aforementioned Mysten Labs, the only ""official"" partners it lists on its website include MIT Media Lab, Satellogic, Aecom and Veea. The latter three have significant connections to the U.S. government, namely the U.S. military and intelligence community.

MIT Media Lab was previously the force behind the creation of the Digital Currency Initiative, which partnered with the U.S. Federal Reserve on assessing the feasibility of a U.S. dollar CBDC (that effort is known as Project Hamilton). It is also known for its prior yet very deep financial relationship with sex trafficker of minors, currency speculator and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein, who not only funded MIT Media Lab and cultivated a close relationship with its former head Joi Ito, but also brought in other major donors like Bill Gates and Leon Black. Epstein was extremely interested in cryptocurrency and previously invited crypto pioneer Brock Pierce to his island to speak on cryptocurrency. Pierce would later create the dollar stablecoin Tether (USDT) along with William Quigley, a long-time business partner of Bill Elkus, a former trustee of the J. Epstein Foundation and founding partner of Idealab, the first institutional investor in PayPal. MIT Media Lab appears to not have publicly commented on its partnership with O.N.E. Amazon.

The other partner of O.N.E. Amazon in its IoF project is Satellogic. Satellogic was recently the recipient of $30 million investment from Tether (USDT) and Howard Lutnick, the long-time CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald - the custodian of much of Tether's U.S. Treasuries, sits on the board. Lutnick and Cantor both hold 23.9% each of Satellogic shares, for a combined 47.8%. Lutnick was recently named co-chair of Donald Trump's transition team, where he will help Trump choose cabinet and other executive appointments if Trump's 2024 election bid is successful. Satellogic's board is also chaired by Steve Mnuchin, Trump's former Treasury Secretary who helped implement BlackRock's ""Going Direct"" plan months before and throughout the Covid-19 crisis. ""Going Direct"" put the bulk of money printed for economic relief intended to mitigate the effects of lockdown policies on regular Americans into the hands of Wall Street giants like BlackRock. BlackRock, whose head Larry Fink was tapped by Trump to develop the government's fiscal response to the crisis, used much of that money to buy shares in their own ETFs. The former Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. military under Trump, Joseph Dunford, is also on the board of Satellogic.

Aside from its board, Satellogic's co-founders, Emiliano Kargieman and Gerardo Richarte, were long-time contractors for DARPA, the NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies prior to founding Satellogic. Kargieman recently stated that the company's investment from Tether would help Satellogic advance more easily into the U.S. ""National Security market,"" i.e. intelligence contracts. Tether itself onboarded the FBI, the U.S.' domestic intelligence agency, and Secret Service onto its platform last year, allowing them to surveil and seize Tether from wallets deemed unfriendly by the U.S. government.

In addition, Satellogic, as we reported in Debt From Above, was also a key partner in an effort called GREEN+, which seeks to use satellite surveillance to turn Latin America's protected areas into tokenized carbon credits to be traded on the Bitcoin side-chain Rootstock (RSK) and to finance industrial projects that would construct an inter-continental ""smart grid"" digitally linking the Americas.

Debt From Above: The Carbon Credit Coup Latin America is quietly being forced into a carbon market scheme through regional contractual obligations - enforced by the satellites of a US intelligence-linked firm - which seeks to create an inter-continental ""smart grid,"" erode national and local sovereignty, and link carbon-based life to the debt-based monetary system via a Bitcoin sidechain.

Satellogic isn't the only concerning firm partnered with O.N.E. Amazon. Another partner, Aecom, is the successor to the CIA-linked Ashland Oil and currently contracts extensively with USAID, widely believed to be a CIA front organization. In the 1970s, Ashland Oil pled guilty to multiple counts of making illegal domestic campaign contributions, which later became part of the Watergate scandal, and of bribing government officials in several countries. During this same period, Ashland was revealed to be a recipient of large amounts of CIA funds for ""undisclosed purposes,"" roughly half of which were paid in cash. Ashland, the CIA and the SEC all refused to comment on the nature of these payments. The Washington Post also reported in the late 1970s that the CIA had used Ashland Oil as ""a cover for an agent operating abroad."" In addition, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ashland Oil played a central role in a number of scandals that involved CIA veterans operating in Oman and Libya. Those veterans worked on behalf of what was known as the ""private CIA"" created during the Carter administration by Ted Shackley, the CIA's ""blonde ghost,"" and former CIA covert operations officer Thomas Clines. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, the ""private CIA"" cabal initiated what would become known as the Iran-Contra scandal and its members, including Clines, would become its main conspirators. The same group would later help give rise to Jeffrey Epstein and the networks that enabled his sexual and financial misdeeds.

The subsidiary of Ashland that would become Aecom, Ashland Technology, was formed in 1985, when Ashland was still steeped in clandestine intelligence ties. It was formally spun off in 1990, forming Aecom. Aecom, which now describes itself as an infrastructure firm serving governments, businesses and organizations, acquired long-time USAID, World Bank and Ford Foundation contractor PADCO (Planning and Development Collaborative International). It subsequently acquired a PADCO competitor, The Services Group, and launched Aecom International Development, making the company a major contractor to USAID. The Ford Foundation has long-standing connections to the CIA and USAID itself is widely believed to itself be a CIA front (see here, here, here and here). One of Aecom's partners on USAID contracts, the Nature Conservancy, is deeply connected to the efforts to financialize nature and use ""debt-for-nature"" or ""debt-for-climate"" swaps to force national governments in the Global South to implement certain policies favored by Nature Conservancy stakeholders, such as J.P. Morgan. Notably, a document provided by O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea to the SEC, claims that USAID is directly involved in O.N.E. Amazon's efforts along with unspecified ""UN agencies.""

Veea is a major developer of ""smart city"" technology that is pioneering the creep of those technologies into rural areas and farms. They are also a major provider of 5G technology. They have a deep relationship with U.S. military contractor Qualcomm, which describes itself as ""the driving force behind the development, launch and expansion of 5G."" Veea is one of Qualcomm's main partners in that endeavor. For instance, Veea is part of Qualcomm's Rural Cloud Initiative, which seeks to use 5G connectivity to ""digitally transform"" rural areas and agriculture through developing its AI-powered ""FarmGrid solution."" Veea is also part of Qualcomm's Smart Cities Accelerator Program. Veea is also a major provider of technology aimed at deploying the ""metaverse"" and augmented reality wearables. For example, last year, they announced a merger with augmented reality hardware producer Ostendo Technologies. As will be noted later, Peter Knez's venture before O.N.E. Amazon, the Venom Foundation, was also pushing into the metaverse. Ostendo is backed by the U.S. military's DARPA and Peter Thiel, who co-founded the deeply CIA-linked data-mining firm Palantir. Thiel is intimately connected to Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance and previously played a significant role in Trump's transition team during his first term in addition to being a major donor to Trump in the 2016 election. Ostendo has also worked as a contractor for the U.S. intelligence community's DARPA-equivalent IARPA.

Veea provides the hardware that links together the Internet of Forests (IoF) sensors, which were developed by MIT media Lab and ""others."" It states that building the IoF will occur in 5 phases, beginning with data infrastructure, followed by satellite and drone-provided imagery. The subsequent phases involve ""environmental sensing,"" ""socio-environmental sensing"" which appears to refer to surveilling the activities of locals living in the surveilled areas, and finally ""bio-sensing"" that will provide ""molecule-level insights.""

Veea frames the IoF project as ultimately leading toward an ""AI-driven neural network for our planet."" The effort to develop that neural network, framed as being founded on the ""principle that all species and ecosystems on this planet are part of a single system,"" are already underway. Called ""Enterprise Neurosystem,"" the goal is to ""link all the relevant climate networks and data sources"" for ""climate projects"" around the world into ""a single open AI framework"" and ""conduct a higher order analysis across all points of reference in real time."" This ""AI neurosystem"" would span the entire planet and its partners include not only Veea, but Microsoft, Google, Meta/Facebook, IBM, Intel and Yahoo!, among others. In other words, the IoF of O.N.E. Amazon is intended to eventually span every forest, everywhere, with major implications for nature and society.

O.N.E. Amazon's Dubious Track Record and Future Plans

In September 2022, O.N.E. Amazon signed an agreement with the indigenous organization FICSH, which represents the Shuar people of the Ecuadorian Amazon. FICSH, after reading the agreement more carefully, voted to cancel the agreement with O.N.E. Amazon just a few months later in early February 2023. Regional activist groups like Acción Ecológica have noted that the contract signed dramatically favored the interests of O.N.E. Amazon and put the Shuar at a major disadvantage.

For example, the surveillance systems placed in the forest as part of the agreement, i.e. systems like the Internet of Forests, would be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, and the company could use any type of surveillance device in Shuar territory and pass that data along to anyone they choose without oversight. In addition, any development or conservation project in Shuar territory related to the agreement are to also be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon and the company also possesses final authority over what private businesses or NGOs can enter Shuar territory to execute those projects.

The Shuar are also expected to help facilitate the surveillance of its territories by both the sensor network and by satellite, i.e. Satellogic, and those that ultimately purchase the O.N.E. Amazon digital asset security are also enabled to ""observe"" the Shuar's land via satellite per the contract. The proceeds from the sale from the security derived from Shuar land are also to be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, with the Shuar only entitled to 15% of the profits that O.N.E. Amazon and its OAIF custody. The contract says the Shuar would receive half of their money within 30 days after the sale concludes and the remaining half would be disbursed annually over the remaining 30 year duration of the contract.

In addition, only O.N.E. Amazon can unilaterally cancel the agreement, meaning that the Shuar's rapid change of opinion in the contractual agreement could see them still wait decades before they are actually free of its terms. It also opens up the possibility that O.N.E. Amazon could cancel the contracts after selling its securities but before the 30 days they have to pay the Shuar their half of their meager share of the sales. Ultimately, as REDD-Monitor's Chris Lang noted, O.N.E. Amazon's contract with the Shuar ""would result in a panopticon-level of surveillance over"" their territory, give O.N.E. Amazon control over the monetization of that data, allow O.N.E. Amazon to choose what businesses can enter into and act upon Shuar territory without Shuar consent, and allow O.N.E. Amazon to make almost all of the money. O.N.E. Amazon seems to have secured the signing of this deeply inequitable contract by paying Shuar leadership $10,000 followed by $90,000 once the contract was signed. Yet, given what the Shuar have lost and stand to lose - and what O.N.E. Amazon stands to gain - $100,00 is next to nothing.

In addition to their past contracts with the Shuar, there is also the partnership between the Colombian government and O.N.E. Amazon to consider. O.N.E. Amazon, which no longer publicly discusses its past controversy with the Shuar, instead highlights their partnership with the government of Colombia and how the OAIF will be investing in ""energy transition and circular economy projects"" which will ostensibly benefit both the local environment and local inhabitants.

For instance, the proposed OAIF-funded project in Ciénaga involves a ""clean energy"" port and industrial park as well as two offshore wind projects to be placed off the coast of the Ciénaga port. The offshore wind projects will be entirely owned by BlueFloat, a Spanish offshore wind company. BlueFloat is a portfolio company of 547 energy, which itself is part of the Houston-based Quantum Energy Partners (now Quantum Capital). Quantum, traditionally focused on the oil and gas sector, has - since 2021 - been investing very heavily in carbon capture and carbon market infrastructure companies and it was reported in June 2024 that Quantum has been attempting to sell its stake in BlueFloat for €500 million.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, the Environmental Impact Assessments for the offshore wind projects will be performed by USAID contractor and O.N.E. Amazon partner Aecom. The bulk of the power generated by this plant will not go toward powering local communities but instead will mainly power the Ciénaga industrial park including the Ciénaga desalination and ""green"" hydrogen production plant as well as the proposed Ciénaga ""green"" mineral processing zone, which will process raw minerals from Chile and Argentina (likely lithium) and other South American countries. The area of Ciénaga, per O.N.E. Amazon, has 2000 hectares of industrial ""development potential.""

The master plan for the OAIF-funded project(s) in Ciéwnaga

In addition, as noted by O.N.E. Amazon, the ""stakeholders"" they have engaged with respect to the offshore wind project does not include local inhabitants, indigenous groups or environmental activists. Instead, it includes ""authorities in key [Colombian government] institutions involved in the project"" as well as the British and Spanish embassies, which O.N.E. Amazon says are ""closely collaborat[ing]"" on the projects. It also states that there have been ""discussions"" with the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank, defined by the U.S. military as ""financial weapons"" of U.S. government power, about ""potential support schemes"" for the projects.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, locals who will benefit from these projects will merely be those employed as ""workers, maintenance personnel and [other employed] possibly in related activities such as transportation and logistics."" The proposed projects at Ciénaga will ""benefit"" indigenous tribes by ""conserving"" the ""black line"" (línea negra) that separates indigenous territory from non-indigenous territory.

In addition to Ciénaga, O.N.E. Amazon is backing the production of biocrude from agricultural biomass. The end result of the biocrude produced will be for the aviation industry, as it is intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The plants will be run and operated (and presumably owned) by two foreign companies - the Dutch company BTG Bioliquids and Alder Fuels (now Alder Renewables). BTG and Alder are partners.

Alder was founded by Bryan Sherbacrow, who embezzled $5.9 million from Alder and was sentenced to 3 years in prison this past June. In January 2023, shortly before Sherbacrow was removed from his role as CEO, Alder received millions from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop its SAF production process, which has also been tested at the DoE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ""with support from the U.S. Defense and Logistics Agency,"" part of the U.S. military. Alder is also seeking to use ""blockchain technology tools to account for all the emissions claims from the use of the SAF"" in order to ""generate the necessary records and transparency for compliance with regulatory frameworks, ESG standards and other sustainability commitments."" This will directly enable the functionality of carbon markets as it relates to air travel.

In summary, the O.N.E. Amazon's OAIF-funded projects in Colombia profiled above are industrial projects that will greatly benefit foreign companies and are being closely developed with foreign governments (like the UK and Spain) as well as entities that are funded by or are contractors for the U.S. government. Their ""environmental"" benefits are dubious and, while it would create industrial hubs that could theoretically generate economic growth for the population, the bulk of the infrastructure will be owned by foreign companies, which also receive the vast majority of the profits that result from these projects.

Starlight Ventures and Jalak Jobanputra

O.N.E. Amazons's sole known funder is Starlight Ventures, which funds companies that produce ""transformative technologies to fix the world."" Its other investments focus mainly on biotechnology, lab-grown meat, carbon market infrastructure, autonomous mining vehicles and space-related technologies, especially satellite surveillance firms. The firm was co-founded by Patricia Wexler, a Venezuelan-American businesswoman who previously worked with top Disney executives and then Elevation Partners, a significant investor in Facebook, Uber and other prominent tech companies.

Starlight Ventures also has ties to the Endeavor Network, which is deeply embedded in Latin America - particularly its cryptocurrency infrastructure - and is heavily funded by the controversial Bronfman family and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay and owner of PayPal from 2002 to 2015. For instance, one of its three venture partners is Santiago Bilinkis, one of the earliest fixtures in the Endeavor Network who - among other things - first connected Wences Casares, the founder of Xapo Bank, with Endeavor's Linda Rottenberg. Bilinkis later co-founded Wanako Games with Casares and has served on Endeavor's board of directors. Bilinkis is still involved with Endeavor's Argentina branch, serving on its Council of Founders alongside Argentine oligarchs like Eduardo Elzstain, host of the Bilderberg-style Llao Llao Forum in Bariloche, Argentina. Starlight also invests in some Endeavor-backed companies, like Satellogic, which is also considerably connected to Endeavor's Argentina branch.

The Chain of Custody: The ""Mafia"" Holding The Elite's Bitcoin The companies poised to dominate the digital financial infrastructure of Latin America have arisen courtesy of the self-described ""mafia"" multiplier, Endeavor. Flush with funds from billionaires linked to the US intelligence and organized crime, Endeavor's influence over the CEOs it has championed promises that, with the ushering in of a new financial system, a wave of covert dollarization will shortly follow.

According to an older profile written by Starlight Ventures about O.N.E. Amazon and cited by Acción Ecologica, an investor named Jalak Jobanputra is named the third co-founder of O.N.E. Amazon. Jobanputra, before founding her VC firm Future Perfect Ventures, was the director of Emerging Market Mobile Investments for Pierre Omidyar's the Omidyar Network and also previously worked for Intel and Lehman Brothers. While at the Omidyar Network, Jobanputra closed ""Omidyar's largest for profit investment ($5M) to date in Latin America, a wireless company that created credit profiles on unbanked middle income consumers using mobile data.""

It was reportedly during her time at the Omidyar Network that Jobanputra became interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrency. More specifically, it was her ""time spent in Africa analyzing the growth of the mobile money services platform M-Pesa,"" which led her to believe that crypto and bitcoin adoption were more likely to succeed in emerging markets. However, Jobanputra links adoption of these technologies to having a digital ID ""that you [can] have different assets associated with and can transact with."" Notably, the Omidyar Network is a long-time funder of technologies that enable CBDC issuance as well as Digital ID. In addition, through Endeavor, the Omidyar Network backs the biggest companies in Latin America's fintech space, effectively dominating the payment rails for crypto and bitcoin and therefore centralizing control over them and neutering the supposed ""decentralizing"" effects of cryptocurrency and bitcoin adoption.

In Jobanputra's case, her current VC firm has invested in a variety of crypto companies including BitGo, Blockstream and Celo. BitGo was founded by Mike Belshe, a big supporter of Trump VP pick JD Vance, alongside Ben Davenport and has previously custodied the U.S. government's bitcoin. Blockstream is fundamentally connected to Bitcoin Core and, thus, has played an outsized role in most of the past major updates made on the Bitcoin network, making them so important to that network that Endeavor's Reid Hoffman once suggested they would be the Microsoft or Google of blockchain (Hoffman is a key member of the Endeavor network and ""PayPal Mafia,"" and was previously a Blockstream board member and is also a major Blockstream investor). Celo is a ""mobile first,"" ""carbon neutral"" blockchain with a major focus on ""scaling voluntary carbon markets"" and stablecoins. Its investors include Reid Hoffman, Jack Dorsey and Coinbase Ventures. Celo has a particularly important relationship with Circle's dollar stablecoin USDC, which Coinbase's Brian Armstrong once suggested would become the U.S.' de facto CBDC. Circle and USDC are deeply connected to BlackRock, with BlackRock holding a minority stake in Circle, Circle's USDC being used to convert shares of BlackRock's first tokenized fund BUIDL into digital dollars, and the Circle Reserve Fund being managed by BlackRock.

Peter Knez and the Venom Foundation

O.N.E. Amazon co-founder Peter Knez began his career at Goldman Sachs as a Quantitive Research Associate, before joining Barclays' BGI as their Chief Investment Officer. While employed at Barclays, Knez personally oversaw the creation of their iShares brand, an essential pillar in the proliferation of the now-dominant ETF market. In a conversation with Nasdaq, Knez claimed that ""ETFs really only started with iShares at BGI."" According to Knez, ""there was a simple reason for developing it: we were the largest institutional asset manager without a mutual fund product and wanted to expand into retail."" The iShares ETFs ""allowed us to enter the retail market and compete with Mutual Funds"" by ""replicating existing indexes with a product that traded on exchanges, while disclosing their holding on a daily basis and delivering liquidity and transparency in a tax efficient format.""

Due to global collateral damage during the 2008 financial crisis, BGI was eventually acquired by BlackRock in 2009, who took the iShares brand to new heights, including the fastest growing ETF in history, the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF. When asked about BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, Knez implied ""we are in the early innings of the 'institutional' regime in cryptocurrencies and blockchain as the Wild West regime ends,"" and later described this institutional regime as ""characterized by increased participation of institutions like BlackRock and by governments"" while noting incoming ""legislation providing a regulatory framework for digital assets"" within the United States. Knez further claims that ""BlackRock wants to participate in this regulatory momentum"" and stated his believe that ""BlackRock will ultimately succeed"" due to their ""excellent track record"" while articulating suspicions that CEO Larry Fink ""would not have gone public if it was not pre-approved.""

Knez, however, has stated that Bitcoin as a speculative asset is less important than the underlying blockchain technology:

""My view is Bitcoin is to blockchain much like search or pornography was to the internet. It drove early adoption, but the underlying technology is much more important. Technologies that remove important frictions and improve benefit for society, those are the ones that persist. Blockchain, in my view, is such a technology, and the institutions believe it, too. I've talked to BlackRock, I had lunch today with very senior people at Morgan Stanley, they believe it too. And they're preparing for it. They're preparing for it because they know it's a quantum leap and they know they have to be in this game they cannot stand on the sidelines.""

In a conversation with CertiK, Knez noted that this imminent transformation was why he ""couldn't resist getting involved."" He later made reference to his former Goldman Sachs boss, Fischer Black, best known as one of the authors of the Black-Scholes equation, who ""started option pricing"" and ""created the whole notion of synthetic replication."" According to Knez, ""tokenization of real world assets is as big, or bigger than that"" and will ""dramatically change the way assets are managed"":

""Once you tokenize it, you can trade it. Once you can trade, it you can index it. Once you index, it you can write synthetics on it. That's transformative in a way that's never been transformed ever...The reason you see guys like Larry Fink pushing tokenization now is, for one, that Aladdin's about to have the functionality he wants for his clients. [And] number two, there's not a lot of alternatives to go scale the business. This is a way for the large institutions, whether it's Morgan Stanley or BlackRock or the other asset managers, this is a way for them to scale their business. And so that's why I think it's inevitable.""

In line with these beliefs, Knez participated in the launch of a new layer one blockchain, Venom, and alongside it founded the Venom Foundation in 2020. Other Venom Foundation members include Mustafa Kheriba, the Executive Chairman of Iceberg Capital; Dr. Kai-Uwe Steck, manager of Pontinova Circle Investment Group; Osman Sultan, the former CEO of DU Telecom and Founder of Fikratech; and Shahal M. Khan, Founder of Burkhan World, Trinity Hospitality Holdings and the CEO of Burtech. In August 2023, the Venom Foundation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United Arab Emirates Government to ""develop and implement the National Carbon Credit System"" in preparation of the country hosting COP28 that November. ""Venom Foundation has provided an unparalleled solution, acting as a key infrastructure for a global ecosystem for Web3 applications, with superfast transaction speeds and unlimited scalability to meet governments' needs."" Knez explained that the foundation is ""the first company in the UAE to develop and licence its blockchain technology and shape the future of national decentralised systems and digitise operations in corporate and government enterprises."" The MOU further covers ""green investment,"" ""adaptation to climate change,"" ""reducing carbon emissions,"" ""preparing and implementing a climate neutrality strategy,"" while ""enhancing partnership opportunities with the private sector.""

Knez expressed his excitement upon the signing of the MOU, commenting that the foundation is ""honored and excited to join hands with the UAE Government to build the National Carbon Credit System."" The press release claims that this was ""a revolutionary collaboration"" which demonstrates ""the UAE's unwavering commitment to bolstering transparency, reliability, and efficiency in carbon emission management"" via ""the next generation blockchain technology of Venom"" which boasts being ""carbon neutral."" Knez, the chair of the foundation, had previously told Nasdaqthat Venom was ""focused on three primary projects: stablecoins, carbon credits, and commodities"" and furthered that ""with respect to stablecoins"" the foundation was ""involved with governments and commercial banks in countries both in Africa and Asia."" Knez believes the ""combination of blockchain and smart contracts"" will ""profoundly transform financial services"" in the ensuing decade. ""They will be unrecognizable, as almost every core function in financial services will be transformed.""

In order to advance this transformation, the Venom Foundation partnered with Iceberg Capital, led by Venom foundation member Mustafa Kheriba, in January 2023 to form the Venom Ventures Fund (VVF). The goal of the VVF was to create ""a ten-figure war chest"" with $1 billion dedicated to ""accelerating the adoption of blockchain, DeFi, and web3 in MENA and beyond."" Knez was chosen to chair the venture, while readying ""strategic investments"" to ""transform digital asset management"" via the ""ideal platform for us to achieve this goal,"" the Venom blockchain. Interestingly, both the Venom Foundation and Iceberg Capital currently operate within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a ""fast-growing financial center situated in the heart of the UAE's capital."" It was founded a decade ago to ""promote entrepreneurship throughout the United Arab Emirates and the wider MENA region."" Venom had previously been granted ""a formal license to issue utility tokens by ADGM"" and according to Forbes, became ""the first blockchain to come under government agency control"" and to be ""monitored by a regulatory body.""

According to reporting from The Block, at the time of its announcement, the fund said it had led a $20 million investment in Nümi Metaverse and the next January announced a $5 million investment in Layer 1 blockchain Everscale, while ""no deals have been announced since."" In a December 2023 tweet, the Venom Foundation announced they will ""no longer continue operating in ADGM and in accordance with section 40 of the regulations, the Foundation has initiated the dissolution process.""

While there is little to show for the $1 billion fund launched in 2023, just last week, Venom announced a ""historic agreement with the government of the Republic of the Philippines"" in order to ""digitize billions of accountable forms using its advanced blockchain technology"" in ""what could end up as the world's largest blockchain use case,"" according to reporting from Gulf News.

Christopher Louis Tsu, the CEO of Venom Foundation, called Venom's selection by the Republic of the Philippines a ""testament to our platform's capabilities and the trust placed in our technology."" He furthered noted that ""by digitizing checks using Venom blockchain, we are not only reducing printing and processing costs but also significantly enhancing transparency and efficiency in financial operations"" demonstrating ""the massive utilization of the Venom blockchain in the form of hundreds of millions of Venom tokens annually"" while showcasing their ""commitment to delivering scalable, secure, and innovative solutions for national-level applications.""

These aspirations for further institutional and nation-state adoption of blockchain was seemingly echoed by Knez in a discussion with CoinTelegraph in March 2023:

""It is the early innings of the institutionalization of Web3. It's early innings, but it's going to happen... If you want to attract institutional money, you're going to have to seek regulation... The era of the Wild West is ending, which I think is good for everybody. So I advise them to to embrace the institutionalization, as that's what time it is.""

Now, with O.N.E. Amazon, it appears clear that Knez is seeking to again partner with major governments to tokenize real world assets, in this case the natural world, and to enable the advancement of a global carbon market/carbon offset economy.

Rodrigo Veloso's ""O.N.E"" Empire

The other co-founder and current CEO of O.N.E. Amazon is Rodrigo Veloso, a Brazilian entrepreneur who developed the O.N.E. Coconut Water brand, later sold to PepsiCo in 2012. That same year he co-founded Brazil's first online insurance company, Segurar.com, though it appears not to have launched until 2013. Around this time, in 2013, Veloso began working at Unik Capital, which operates in both the U.S. and Brazil, and he claims to still work there even though he is not mentioned on the company website. He has also claimed to be the founder of Unik Capital and that he used his funds from selling O.N.E. Coconut Water to Pepsi to do so. However, only CEO Sylvie Proia is listed as the founder on the company's website.

A year after joining Unik Capital, in 2014, Veloso attempted to acquire a decommissioned naval base in Puerto Rico and turn it into a ""mix of Disney World and Las Vegas,"" a ""green city with a focus on entertainment,"" marking his first foray into ""green"" business ventures that would later culminate with his role in co-creating O.N.E. Amazon. In addition to O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso also created another company called O.N.E. Natural Energy that specializes in producing syngas, which can be produced from ""a wide range of carbon-containing substances"" and is used to generate electricity or ""as a building block for a range of desirable commodities, from methanol to gasoline."" O.N.E. Natural Energy currently operates in Brazil.

A few years before creating O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso played an interesting role in the efforts to take Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of the Trump-centric social network Truth Social, public. Beginning in 2021, TMTG planned to merge with Digital World, a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC. The merger ultimately occurred in March of this year. The merger was controversial and fraught with scandals for Digital World. As a consequence of the insider trading allegations and fines from the SEC, former CEO of Digital World Patrick Orlando was fired from that role in March 2023 due to the scandals, though Orlando has sued the new CEO, Eric Swider, alleging Swider had planned a ""coup d'etat"" of Digital World to depose him.

Rodrigo Veloso is a close friend of Orlando's and was a Digital World board member from July 2021 until December 2022. Veloso was also present on a pre-merger call with Trump, while still a board member at Digital World, which later became a key focus of the SEC investigation into Digital World that ended with the SEC suing Orlando (the suit was filed after Orlando was fired from Digital World). The New York Times reported that Veloso was acting as an adviser to Orlando on the call. In addition to the SEC charges against Orlando, Digital World was fined $18 million by the SEC. There have been no allegations of TMTG itself engaging in improper trades or other activities related to charges against Digital World and its past executives. Ultimately, the SPAC merger between TMTG and Digital World added billions to Trump's net worth and allegedly provided a ""financial lifeline"" to the former president. Veloso, in addition to his ties to Orlando and Digital World, was also a board member/director of TMTG itself from September 2021 until December 2022, the same time he resigned from Digital World when the then-Orlando-led company was the subject of several investigations. Notably, during this same period of time (2021-2022), Veloso was laying the groundwork for the formal launch of O.N.E. Amazon, including efforts to trademark the Internet of Forests concept and signing the controversial agreement between O.N.E. Amazon and the Shuar in 2022.

Carbon Sink or Debt Sink?

In examining the efforts of O.N.E. Amazon and their recently announced partnership with Satellogic, it is worth dwelling on why a company like Satellogic, which is deeply tied to the stablecoin Tether and the U.S. Treasuries market through its board member Howard Lutnick, might wish to be involved with such an endeavor.

Much like a corporation, the United States government itself has a budget it must finance, partly through taxation of citizens and companies, but mostly via the issuance of new debt sold in the form of government bonds known as Treasuries. These securities are directly issued by the U.S. Treasury with the yield, or rate of the return, effectively set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and its governors via the Federal Funding Rate, commonly referred to as an interest rate. Typically, these bonds yield a higher rate of return the longer the duration for which they are issued. For example, a 30 year Treasury would yield a higher coupon than a 3 month Treasury to incentivize buyers to hold U.S. debt for greater periods of time, giving the government a longer runway to service their debt obligations. On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Committee cut the targeted federal funding rate to 0% due to ""the effects of the coronavirus"" weighing ""on economic activity in the near term"" and thus ""risks to the economic outlook.""

""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the Fed statement said. ""Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected."" Despite the ensuing lockdowns and widespread fear of the virus, President Trump praised the Fed that week, saying in a briefing at the White House that the rate cut ""makes me very happy."" In retrospect, the combination of government-mandated lockdowns and the Fed's aggressive rate cut, with unprecedented financial stimulus being distributed (with heavy profits) with collaboration from private sector stalwarts like BlackRock, systemically changed the financial system not just for the U.S., but the world at large. In fact, the Fed ""struck a deal"" with five other central banks including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, to ""lower their rates"" to ""keep the financial markets functioning normally.""

By printing trillions of dollars of newly issued debt at effectively 0% interest rates while simultaneously shuttering monetary velocity and demand alongside the businesses forced to close by their reactionary legislation, Trump's Treasury, led by current Satellogic board Chair Steve Mnuchin, massively increased the monetary supply and the U.S. government's debt obligations while minimizing the immediate inflationary effects of such stimulus. This unprecedented combination of Fed, Treasury and domestic policies allowed huge profits for the highest wealth bands in the nation, with those closest to the money spigot able to gobble up commodities with freshly printed dollars. Arguably, no company benefited more than BlackRock, having been a chief architect of the ""Going Direct"" plan, which allowed them to use these supposed pandemic relief funds to purchase large swaths of assets including from their own iShares ETF division, having acquired the Knez-led iShares from Barclay's during the 2008 crisis after the bank denied a government bail out of their own.

The same March 2020 week as the rate cuts, Bitcoin crashed to nearly $3000, oil futures went negative, and real estate and stock markets around the world collapsed, offering an unprecedented buying opportunity to those with the capital to take advantage -- namely the recently ""stimulated"" BlackRock. But the U.S. government still needed a buyer of Treasuries and while finding a new place to sink this freshly issued debt, the Fed itself began ""purchasing massive amounts of debt securities,"" a technique utilized during the 2008 crisis known as Quantitive Easing, or QE. As Brookings notes, the Fed aimed to ""restore smooth functioning"" to the ""Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets"" which ""play a critical role in the flow of credit to the broader economy.""

On March 15, 2020, the Fed ""shifted the objective"" of QE to supporting the economy, agreeing to purchase ""at least $500 billion in Treasury securities"" and ""$200 billion in government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities"" over ""the coming months."" A week later, on March 23, 2020, the Fed agreed to make the purchases open-ended, saying it would acquire securities ""in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" and thus ""expanding the stated purpose of the bond buying to include bolstering the economy."" By June 2020, the Fed lowered the rate of purchases to ""at least $80 billion a month in Treasuries"" and ""$40 billion in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities"" for the time being. The Fed again updated its policy in December 2020 to slow these purchases when the economy made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and in November 2021, the Fed began tapering the pace of securities purchases.

By October 2021, Bitcoin had rocketed to nearly $70,000, and alongside it arose a new insatiable buyer of U.S. debt via government-issued securities -- dollar stablecoin issuers, led by Tether and Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald. As previously reported by Unlimited Hangout:

""In the past 18 months, a new high volume net buyer of this debt has appeared in the cryptocurrency industry: stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether or Circle have purchased over $150 billion of U.S. debt -- in the form of securities issued by the Treasury -- in order to ""back"" the issuance of their dollar-pegged tokens with a dollar-denominated asset. For some perspective on the absolutely astounding amount of volume these relatively young and relatively small businesses have gobbled up of U.S. debt, China and Japan, historically the U.S.' largest creditors, hold just under and just over $1 trillion, respectively, in these same debt instruments. Despite only existing for a decade, and despite only surpassing a $10 billion market cap in 2020, this leaves Tether alone at over 10% the Treasuries held by either of the U.S.' largest nation-state creditors.""

While the likes of Tether's USDT, alongside BlackRock-affiliated Circle's USDC and PayPal's PYUSD issued by Paxos, the U.S. has found partners for servicing the $35 trillion of already-issued debt alongside any future government budget as well as the modern evolution of the public-private partnership of capital creation while sustaining dollar hegemony across the globe via surveillable, programmable and seizable private bank currencies. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino previously claimed that Tether froze around $435 million in USDT for the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service on its path to becoming a ""world class partner"" to the U.S. to ""expand dollar hegemony globally.""

Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald, which holds Tether's T-Bills, is ""among the best-known bond trading houses on Wall Street"" and ""one of 25 primary dealers for U.S. Treasuries"" which allows ""direct trade with the Federal Reserve."" A report from September 2023 stated that Tether held $86.4 billion of assets in reserves with a later attestation report showing that USDT is mostly backed by U.S. Treasuries. By July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 5.5%, the ""highest level in 22 years,"" in hopes of making ""borrowing and investing more expensive."" With rates having risen faster than ever in U.S. history from the 0% target reached in March 2020, firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald -- net buyers of short duration securities known as T-Bills - are set to receive high yields with very little risk. In Tether's Q1 2023 Assurance Report, the stablecoin issuer held $81.8 billion with ""the majority of its reserves"" having been ""invested in U.S. Treasury Bills"" with ""all new issuance of tokens"" having ""been invested in U.S. Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo.""

In this same report, the company announced they would ""regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin (BTC)"" via ""utilizing realized profits from its investment strategy,"" which relied predominantly on short duration Treasuries. In Q1 2023, Tether held approximately $1.5 billion in bitcoin. By April 2024, the firm held approximately 75,354 bitcoin, worth nearly $4.5 billion today.

In Ardoino's statement regarding ""the decision to invest in Bitcoin"", the current CEO of Tether noted ""its limited supply"" as a reason for why the asset has ""emerged as a long-term store of value"" complete with ""substantial growth potential."" Whereas the U.S. government via the Treasury can continually issue these securities with no limit via a capped supply, bitcoin the asset has a predetermined issuance schedule, and an eventual total supply of just under 21 million bitcoin. The scarcity innate to bitcoin allows a debt-based financial system like the U.S. dollar system to continue to inflate into the demand inelastic, deflationary monetary policy of bitcoin. Now that the U.S. en masse has emerged, in no small part thanks to BlackRock's iShares IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF, as the world's largest known holder of bitcoin, complete with regulatory blessing from the likes of the DOJ and SEC, the Treasury has found willing market partners in their quest to service their debts and further dollarize the planet.

But it is perhaps within the planet itself that a new method for retaining U.S. dollar hegemony has emerged - the dollar-denominated, limited supply carbon market proposed by O.N.E. Amazon. Far from an unsubstantiated theory, Knez himself states precisely that the Amazon rainforest ""should be valued in the trillions"" and that his company is ""enabling the market to value it as such"" by ""turning it into an advanced digital asset security."" In a discussion with Gulf News, Knez took this one step further in explaining why the tangible parameters of the Amazon's size led to the creation of a limited supply of securities, providing the necessary mechanism to create a dollar-denominated debt sink out of the rainforest upon the security's appreciation:

""At O.N.E. Amazon, we are harnessing the power of the market - the same force that has driven exploitation - to transform it into a tool for conservation. We aim to prove that the Amazon is more valuable alive than dead.

We're not just environmentalists; we're innovators, economists, technologists, and community leaders. Together, we're developing a digital security asset - that represents the intrinsic value of the world's largest rainforest's biome. This isn't just a financial instrument; it's a statement, a commitment to the belief that the Amazon is valuable and ought to be priced. In terms of financial returns, investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the digital security as the market values the positive environmental and social benefits of the rainforest's biome.

Given the finite size of the Amazon rainforest, the total number of securities will be restricted to 750 million, corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest. This creates a limited supply of digital securities."" [emphasis added]

Due to the limited supply of digital securities, O.N.E. Amazon has created an axiom for vast capital appreciation of the asset itself, allowing a further expansion of dollar-denominated liabilities and thus further eventual demand for the dollar's underlying asset: U.S. Treasuries. Knez implies the Amazon should be valued in the trillions, and, much like he did in his role spearheading the iShares ETF brand, has created yet another growth market for the U.S. capital markets to ""quantitively ease"" into. Interestingly, this type of government debt expansion was theorized by RFK Jr.'s former running mate, Nicole Shanahan, in a project she led at Stanford titled ""An Analysis of Carbon Credit Markets as Validation for Climate Supportive Quantitative Easing Using the Blockchain"" described below:

""This project will provide a white paper for a carbon coin that works in tandem with the existing carbon credit (offset) markets. As an active venture investor in carbon credit markets such as Pachama and Joro Technologies, and a major customer of these offsets with my husband Sergey Brin, I will be leveraging the current entrepreneurial ecosystem to identify the economic, policy, and technological requirements to scale a carbon credit coin...While authors and futurists such as Kim Stanley Robinson (author of Ministry of the Future), have focused on the feasibility of governments issuing carbon coins in exchange for carbon sequestration, my argument is that a private market can first be situated to verify the accuracy of the carbon sequestration projects funded by the coin. The government can in turn, have evidence based results by which to sell government treasuries into the carbon coin network.""

These ""evidence based results"" of which Shanahan theorized, as it relates to the O.N.E. Amazon scheme, would presumably be the data provided by their satellite partner, Satellogic. Due to Satellogic's board being Chaired by former Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Cantor Fitzgerald's Lutnick large stake of shares and board position, and their funding by leading dollar-denominated stablecoin issuer Tether, the personnel and wherewithal to create such a debt sink at a time of dire need has been assembled.

As the U.S.' ballooning debt demands further areas to place their newly-issued debt, Knez and O.N.E. Amazon have all but directly proposed making the 750 million hectares of Amazon rainforest exactly that place.

Datafication & Debt - The New ""Conservation""

O.N.E. Amazon's stated reasons for its business model - ostensibly ""preserving"" and ""conserving"" the Amazon - reflect a broader effort to frame efforts to centralize control over the global commons and build out a surveillance grid for both people and the planet as the only ""feasible"" means of rescuing the planet from catastrophe. However, as this article has endeavored to show, O.N.E. Amazon's interest is not in helping locals or indigenous groups or even in helping actually conserve the rainforest in the way most would imagine. Instead, the goal is to turn the Amazon rainforest into an exploitative farm - a farm for data that itself can be monetized and tokenized, just like the hectarage of the Amazon itself.

As the architects of Wall Street's new web3 economy search for new ways to store the wealth they have pilfered from the public through organized wealth transfers, more forms of ""digital gold"" will become a necessity. While bitcoin represents one digital store of value, the race is on to tokenize real world assets, especially the natural world and natural resources, in order to perpetuate the debt-based monetary system that has enabled the theft of regular people's wealth for centuries. Framed in altruistic terms of ""helping"" the environment and the have-nots, we are instead witnessing the ""datafication"" of all life both for profit and so that all life - including human beings and the natural world - can be surveilled, eventually down to the molecular level, and then ""managed"" by intelligent machines. Such a paradigm does not represent ""conservation"" or ""preservation,"" but rather the onboarding of our greatest natural treasures onto a system of hi-tech control, with every flutter of a butterfly wing and every branch swaying in the breeze being converted into bits and bytes that predatory bankers can trade and speculate on for profit.

O.N.E. Amazon is more than a company, it represents a model that others are following which seeks to borgify the natural world, and us along with it, claiming to ""harness the market"" to save us all from a vague yet impending doom. However, we and the forests are not being saved, we are being put in chains - forced into a prison without walls where the sensors to be placed on and in the trees and on and in our bodies will connect us to the bankers' blockchain of choice and allow us to be traded or sold, our biological signals and processes monetized for their benefit, and the masses of people, plants and animals on this planet to be ""managed"" by AI-powered machines that they program and control.

How to Spot the Next 100x Meme Coins? | SOL Pepe | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/c510e-how-to-spot-the-next-100x-meme-coins,2024-08-31,CryptoRank,"Meme coins offer an easy entry into a dynamic market, where virtually anyone could generate a new project. The first digital asset of this type was Dogecoin (DOGE), an asset that aimed to use crypto technology for fun. DOGE was in fact a full coin, which relied on proof-of-work just like Bitcoin. Later, meme asset used token technology, and relied on other chains like Ethereum or Solana.

The meme coin market ranges from projects with utility and elaborate reward systems, to humorous themes with a nonsensical image. The biggest attraction of meme assets was their ability to grow from nothing into a multi-billion projects, appreciating faster than the rest of the crypto market and taking the spotlight from Bitcoin maximalists.

Market timing and luck meant some early buyers easily achieved 1000X appreciation and soon those opportunities took the crypto world by a storm. Grabbing the next 100X meme coin may also require additional research as the market conditions shift and buyers become more cautious. In this guide, we will cover techniques on how to spot next 100x meme coins and exploit their unique cryptocurrency potential.

Meme coins, as their name suggests, are based on the images and visual language of Internet, spawned on forums, message boards, chat apps and social media. The market for meme-based digital assets emerged from a single image, that of Kabosu, the original Shiba Inu dog that drove the success of DOGE. The strong community of DOGE took the crypto market by a storm, even competing with major cryptocurrencies. DOGE was the first meme to reach a market cap above $1B and has remained a top cryptocurrency for years.

The first generation of derivative memes also followed the ""doge"" model, spawning Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FlokiInu (FLOKI). Soon, several other categories of memes appeared, again riding on the joke of the Shiba Inu breed.

Still using the Shiba Inu breed, a series of copies appeared, aiming to build communities around a familiar image.

Frogs/Pepes: The original Pepe is a widely known cartoon character, created by artist Mark Furie. Pepe became an Internet icon on the former Twitter social media, after becoming the go-to meme on 4Chan. Pepe-themed assets can be launched independently, but are also closely tied to PolitiFi. The meme also spawned the Original Pepe NFT collection.

Those images aimed to be cute and harmless, capitalizing on the Internet's love of cats. Cat-themed launches often focus on communities and compete with doge-themed projects.

PolitiFi: this section of memes is the most contentious, focusing on political wars and themes freshly derived from world events. The main focus of PolitiFi remains US politics and the Presidential election. PolitiFi derives its images from Internet art, often an example of Wojaks, the visual shorthand for political affiliations.

Big and small celebrities from sports, show business or dubious Internet fame have tried to capitalize on the frenzy. Unlike organic memes, celebrity projects are often viewed with suspicion, despite also outperforming in the short term.

Trends: WifHat, wrapped, baby are all modifiers of existing memes. Other similar images have no claims to greatness, except being appealing and cozy. Accessorized assets, especially ""WifHat"", tend to draw loyal communities, focusing on holding until the token breaks to a new price level.

Features like the speed, fees and the available liquidity of the chain set the pace for permissionless swapping. The availability of bots and general popularity also shape the possibilities for investors.

Almost all chains and networks can generate decentralized liquidity pairs, but the most active ecosystems only rely on a handful of leading platforms.

Since 2023, Solana has become the home to the most active decentralized trade. As a cryptocurrency, SOL has had wide adoption and become a source of value for decentralized market pairs. SOL is still among the top cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization.

Driven by bots, but also real users, Solana's decentralized market got a boost from the most influential projects, including PEPE, BOME, WIF, POPCAT, MEW and others. Those top trading pairs set the stage for similar features, while carrying meme trading into mainstream centralized exchanges. Solana's ecosystem includes the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX), where a listing allows a coin to grow and gain buyers.

The original network for tokenization, Ethereum was also the home of Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the first tokenized memes. Ethereum relies on Uniswap for new token liquidity. Sometimes, there are competing versions, as in the case of Neiro (NEIRO), launched both on Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum carries the ETH cryptocurrency, which has relatively high barriers to entry because of its high price. Gas fees are one of the features of Ethereum that can still discourage retail investors.

The Base blockchain, launched by Coinbase, is a tokenless protocol with a login-based wallet. Due to the lower fees and easier user onboarding, Base has more registered activity than Ethereum. Almost all memes have a Base version, relying either on Uniswap or Aerodrome.

Toncoin is the chain closely tied to Telegram users. Meme creation on Toncoin is a bit more deliberate. Some of the Toncoin assets are only created after building a Telegram community and setting up expectations for an airdrop. Memes on Toncoin also do not copy all the themes from Ethereum and Solana, instead they often track the interests and hype on obscure Telegram communities.

Practically all L1 and L2 chains have attracted meme communities. Dextools lists more than 80 networks, with BNBChain, Polygon and TRON among the most active. Some chains have practically no activity, so using the current dashboard is the best way to estimate whether a chain is active enough and offers sufficient liquidity. Using smaller chains poses the additional challenge of buying obscure and illiquid native coins. Not all L2 small chains lock in enough value to ensure robust decentralized features.

One of the main sources of liquidity pairs that start from nothing and grow into $1B valuations are launchpads like Pump.fun or Moonshot.

New listings start with minimal liquidity and trade erratically, while trying to generate attention, bring in more traders and boost liquidity to become top coins. After reaching sufficient liquidity, the newly listed meme coins can move on to a decentralized exchange like Raydium or Uniswap.

Moonshot does not have its own website, but is available through Dexscreener, offering intuitive access to newly listed, trending or already established coins. Moonshot is a new tool for crypto enthusiasts, listing new pairs before they move onto a cryptocurrency exchange.

The platforms offer a fair launch for brand-new assets and serve to build up both interest and liquidity. Once a predetermined level of liquidity is reached, the pair moves on to Raydium and can start more regular activity with higher volumes.

At the start of picking a new meme coin, users must connect one of the approved wallets. The platforms work even for traders with no available wallet, and will redirect them to MetaMask, Phantom or other compatible wallets.

Moonshot DexScreener will provide an intuitive preview of the newest, as well as the hottest trending meme tokens and top meme coins. Moonshot listings will have an intuitive progress bar to estimate how far they are from achieving enough liquidity to be ""finalized"" and move on to other DEX.

The progress bar and time since launch will give a clear visual on whether a popular meme coin is on the move, or it has stalled in building up liquidity.

Pump.fun takes a less formal approach to listing new meme tokens. Since a record number of projects are listing, the launchpad has a very basic interface, with no tools to filter the new tokens. Pump.fun offers a random selection of meme coins, but they can be filtered for relevance based on previous wallet activity.

Listings on Pump.fun also offer access to the profile of creators, to track for serial launches and previously successful investments. Overall, an estimated 99% of meme launches will fail to reach Raydium. Pump.fun recently added live chats to each new launch, to give a glimpse of the community and potential interest as factors for success. Some of the tokens will have market cap badges, or notify potential buyers about livestreams. A live stream will often coincide with a short-term meme coin pump.

Even with highly original memes, Pump.fun launches are often not engineered for mass appeal and fail to grab the attention of social media.

Conditions on Pump.fun may change overnight. Most traders in the crypto community focus on newly launched tokens, which survive for only a few hours in their initial trading. Even a 100X pair in that initial stage can have very low returns and negligible liquidity. The ability to mint for a low cost or for free creates an unlimited amount of new launches, where the main strategy is to ""ape"" as fast as possible with small initial investments.

Once the listed pair achieve escape liquidity, they are listed as new pairs on the respective DEX. Solana meme coins land on Raydium. To access new trading pairs, aggregators like DexScreener or Dextools will give an overview of liquidity, activity and other information on whether the pair has stabilized.

New pairs will often also fail, just minutes after being listed on a DEX. Early-stage meme coins can have the biggest upside, but it is also matched by the high failure rate of nearly 99%. To ensure new meme coins are liquid, DEX trends give a glimpse of top meme coins and have healthy trading pools.

Trending themes give a glimpse of where retail has moved in, and which memes are the most appealing.

Copying a whale or a high-profile wallet may be a suitable strategy to finding a 100X meme token.

The best way to find currently active whales is through Dextools. Among currently trending communities, the occasional whale transaction will expose wallet addresses with a longer risk-taking history.

Sometimes, whales also appear in the order books of daily losers, the coins that erased most of their value. Whale action may signal the asset is ready to recover and outperform.

Manually checking the activity of whales may be too time-consuming. Tools like Dexchecker will give a preview of ""large trades"" and their latest activities. Then, move onto the ""Wallet Screener"" tab, and explore a whale's activity history.

Some of the addresses which have shown good performance can then be tracked for buying additional meme coins. Whale watching apps can create alerts when the selected wallets are active.

One way to spot the next 100X meme coins is to look at newly launched pairs on decentralized exchanges.

Dextools offers a filter to access meme coins, including a selection based on the liquidity pair age. Setting up the filter will produce a list of assets and their earnings for a specified date. New pairs may appreciate by thousands of percent within hours.

Setting up filters will bring out the hottest pairs with a relatively small age. High liquidity may be a positive sign that the liquidity pool will be more resilient.

Filtering out the best 100X meme coins will also depend on the prevalence of buyers. Before committing to a meme coin, it is best to check back on its wallet profile and make sure there are no worrying insider holdings or wallet clusters on Bubblemaps.

Buying a newly launched coin on Ethereum or Solana may not be straightforward and may depend on gas fee conditions. Transactions on Solana or Ethereum may be more costly than usual, especially for very fast purchases within the next block.

One of the most widely used bots to snipe coins on Solana is BonkBot, a Telegram-based app. BonkBot will put speed first and buy as fast as possible by simply pasting the token address.

BonkBot has a native wallet that needs a SOL deposit to start buying. The main function of BoinkBot is to buy meme coins very quickly, by using Solana services like Jupiter DEX aggregator and the JitoSOL validator.

To achieve its goal of sniping, BonkBot does not pay attention to the required fees or price slippage. For some coins, the buying fees may surpass the potential earnings. BonkBot is considered secure, but it is crucial to be aware of risks and avoid investing money you are not prepared to lose.

Several related Telegram bots can perform even faster than BonkBot but incur unpredictable fees. Transaction speed may also lag behind professional traders with high-speed connection and running RPC nodes for faster access.

BonkBot Telegram channels also perform pre-selection to notice a trend, with the potential to buy very fast without leaving the channel. The projects may seem relatively safe to invest in, but they still hold some risk of a rug pull.

Top meme coins can still grow by 100X after reaching decentralized exchanges. Even at that stage, the relatively new trending pairs need additional research to reassure against a rug pull and a crash to zero. Most new additions to Raydium or Uniswap will indeed go to zero, as early investors realize lower profits and lock in gains.

To make sure a coin pair has locked liquidity and will not go through a rug pull, click on its name on Dextools, then check the side bar for additional data. Projects with locked liquidity will have an icon, displaying the available pools and whether any locks are in place.

Before committing to a token, also check for duplicates, copycats or scams. The Rugcheck tool on Solana will check for duplicate tickers. TokenSniffer will also monitor the blockchain for known scams or honeypots.

Community engagement will also give a glimpse of a growing project. The communities of early meme coins like PEPE, BOME, SLERF, WIF and even SHIB and FLOKI show high-level activity and engagement. Online communities also warn of possible scams and set the terms of engagement to avoid malicious links in comments or in messages.

Social media content arrives at a later stage and will point to the potential development of a token. Some assets work as ""degen"" meme coins, where buying the dips or ""aping"" is the most common strategy. Others, like PEPE and WIF, focus on long-term holding, while waiting for adoption and 100X rallies.

Once a trading pair has established liquidity, it is still necessary to see if trading would be fair. Bubblemaps can check smart contracts and visualize the presence of large wallets.

The most important element to look for on Bubblemaps is ""wallet clusters,"" which are connected wallets that trade or move meme coins between them. A wallet cluster is easy to spot when visualized. Clusters are usually the work of insiders, who use them to fake token traffic and trading.

Even coins with some investment history may develop clusters after insiders buy back at low prices or move in to create fake volumes.

Bubblemaps works by inputting the name of the chosen asset or its address and then looking over the visualization to check for connected wallets. For example, a wallet cluster will display constant transactions between wallets based on blockchain data.

Identifying and sniping an early-stage project may be risky and incur additional costs. But even more established meme coins can deliver 100X growth. Other meme coins with top volume can indicate a more promising investment while avoiding stagnation. Tools like Dexcheck will show which older pairs are trending and which ones are stagnating.

Another tool to discover investments is Dexcheck, which also built a section to explore whale holdings and the success of high-frequency trading wallets.

At this stage, the project's social media footprint gains importance. An explosive growth in followers or posting, as well as announcements, can show if a meme coin is here to stay.

Established meme coins also show a rollover of traders. Buying the dip in digital assets can lead to significant appreciation, though the 100X growth stage may not be possible.

One fast way to discover the next 100X meme coin is to ask a chatbot. The Tokenmetrics AI tool is still experimental but can aggregate suggestions on potential winners.

Meme coins rely on their X (formerly Twitter) communities, but some are also growing their influence on Telegram. A growing community of channels may indicate enough holders to avoid a rug pull, at least in the short term.

Meme coins are inherently risky, but there may be additional ways to lose SOL or ETH. Telegram sniping bots are risky, due to the usage of their groups. Scams through DM attempt to steal private keys and can also drain wallets. Some bots may also be inherently risky, or at least unpredictably expensive to use.

Always perform your own research, as there are risks involved at all stages of investing.",https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,0.4666666666666666
How to Spot the Next 100x Meme Coins?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-spot-the-next-100x-meme-coins/,2024-08-31,Cryptopolitan,"Meme coins offer an easy entry into a dynamic market, where virtually anyone could generate a new project. The first digital asset of this type was Dogecoin (DOGE), an asset that aimed to use crypto technology for fun. DOGE was in fact a full coin, which relied on proof-of-work just like Bitcoin. Later, meme asset used token technology, and relied on other chains like Ethereum or Solana.

The meme coin market ranges from projects with utility and elaborate reward systems, to humorous themes with a nonsensical image. The biggest attraction of meme assets was their ability to grow from nothing into a multi-billion projects, appreciating faster than the rest of the crypto market and taking the spotlight from Bitcoin maximalists.

Market timing and luck meant some early buyers easily achieved 1000X appreciation and soon those opportunities took the crypto world by a storm. Grabbing the next 100X meme coin may also require additional research as the market conditions shift and buyers become more cautious. In this guide, we will cover techniques on how to spot next 100x meme coins and exploit their unique cryptocurrency potential.

Types of meme coins

Meme coins, as their name suggests, are based on the images and visual language of Internet, spawned on forums, message boards, chat apps and social media. The market for meme-based digital assets emerged from a single image, that of Kabosu, the original Shiba Inu dog that drove the success of DOGE. The strong community of DOGE took the crypto market by a storm, even competing with major cryptocurrencies. DOGE was the first meme to reach a market cap above $1B and has remained a top cryptocurrency for years.

The first generation of derivative memes also followed the ""doge"" model, spawning Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FlokiInu (FLOKI). Soon, several other categories of memes appeared, again riding on the joke of the Shiba Inu breed.

Doge-themed

Still using the Shiba Inu breed, a series of copies appeared, aiming to build communities around a familiar image.

Frogs/Pepes: The original Pepe is a widely known cartoon character, created by artist Mark Furie. Pepe became an Internet icon on the former Twitter social media, after becoming the go-to meme on 4Chan. Pepe-themed assets can be launched independently, but are also closely tied to PolitiFi. The meme also spawned the Original Pepe NFT collection.

Cat-themed

Those images aimed to be cute and harmless, capitalizing on the Internet's love of cats. Cat-themed launches often focus on communities and compete with doge-themed projects.

PolitiFi: this section of memes is the most contentious, focusing on political wars and themes freshly derived from world events. The main focus of PolitiFi remains US politics and the Presidential election. PolitiFi derives its images from Internet art, often an example of Wojaks, the visual shorthand for political affiliations.

Celebrity

Big and small celebrities from sports, show business or dubious Internet fame have tried to capitalize on the frenzy. Unlike organic memes, celebrity projects are often viewed with suspicion, despite also outperforming in the short term.

Trends: WifHat, wrapped, baby are all modifiers of existing memes. Other similar images have no claims to greatness, except being appealing and cozy. Accessorized assets, especially ""WifHat"", tend to draw loyal communities, focusing on holding until the token breaks to a new price level.

Bitcoin has made significant strides in the world of online casinos, and its popularity continues to rise. With the advent of Bitcoin, players can enjoy fast, secure, and anonymous transactions, making it an attractive option for online blackjack enthusiasts.

Over the past few years, Bitcoin has gained traction in the online gambling industry. More and more online casinos are starting to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, revolutionizing the way players fund their accounts and withdraw their winnings.

Bitcoin's rise in popularity can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the currency, making it immune to government interference and regulation. This decentralized nature also means that transactions can be processed faster, without the need for intermediaries such as banks.

Another reason for Bitcoin's popularity in online casinos is its security features. Bitcoin transactions are secured using advanced cryptographic techniques, making it virtually impossible for hackers to manipulate or steal funds. This provides players with peace of mind, knowing that their financial information is safe and secure.

Bitcoin offers players the benefit of anonymity. Traditional payment methods often require players to provide personal information, such as their name, address, and credit card details. With Bitcoin, however, players can make transactions without revealing any personal information, ensuring their privacy is protected.

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography for security. When it comes to online gambling, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks, ensuring privacy and secure transactions for players.

When a player uses Bitcoin to gamble online, their transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. This ledger is decentralized and maintained by a network of computers, known as nodes, spread across the globe. Each transaction is verified by these nodes, ensuring its validity and preventing fraud.

One of the key advantages of using cryptocurrencies in online gambling is the speed of transactions. Traditional payment methods often involve lengthy processing times, with withdrawals taking several days to complete. With Bitcoin, however, transactions are processed almost instantly, allowing players to access their winnings quickly.

In addition to speed, cryptocurrencies also offer lower transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods. This is because cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as banks, which often charge fees for their services. With Bitcoin, players can enjoy lower transaction costs, maximizing their winnings.

Cryptocurrencies provide players with a level of transparency that is unparalleled in traditional gambling. The blockchain technology used by cryptocurrencies allows players to verify the fairness of games and the integrity of the casino. This transparency builds trust between players and online casinos, ensuring a fair and enjoyable gambling experience.

With the rising popularity of Bitcoin, more and more blackjack sites are now accepting this cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for players who want to enjoy their favorite card game while taking advantage of the benefits that Bitcoin offers.

However, with so many options available, it can be overwhelming to pick the right blackjack site that suits your needs. To help you make an informed decision, here are some key features to consider:

When choosing a Bitcoin blackjack site, there are several factors that you should take into account.

While Bitcoin offers enhanced security compared to traditional payment methods, it's still crucial to take precautions when playing online blackjack with cryptocurrencies. Here are some safety measures to keep in mind:

By considering these key features and safety measures, you can choose the right Bitcoin blackjack site that not only provides an enjoyable gaming experience but also ensures the security of your funds and personal information.

If you're new to using Bitcoin for online blackjack, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

The first step is to set up a Bitcoin wallet, which will serve as your digital wallet for storing, sending, and receiving Bitcoin. You can choose from various types of wallets, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and online wallets.

When setting up a software wallet, you will need to download and install the wallet software on your computer or mobile device. This software will generate a unique Bitcoin address for you, which you can use to receive funds. It is important to keep your wallet software updated and secure to protect your Bitcoin.

Hardware wallets, on the other hand, are physical devices that store your Bitcoin offline. They offer enhanced security as they are not connected to the internet, making them less vulnerable to hacking attempts. To use a hardware wallet, you will need to connect it to your computer or mobile device when making transactions.

Online wallets are web-based services that allow you to store and manage your Bitcoin through a website. These wallets are convenient as you can access them from any device with an internet connection. However, it is crucial to choose a reputable online wallet provider to ensure the safety of your funds.

Once you have a Bitcoin wallet, you need to fund it with Bitcoin. To deposit Bitcoin on a blackjack site, you will be provided with a unique address where you can send your Bitcoin. This address acts as a destination for your funds and ensures that they are credited to your account correctly.

When depositing Bitcoin, you will need to initiate a transaction from your wallet software or online wallet. You will enter the blackjack site's unique address as the recipient and specify the amount of Bitcoin you want to send. After confirming the transaction, the Bitcoin network will process it, and the funds will be credited to your account on the blackjack site.

Withdrawing Bitcoin from a blackjack site follows a similar process. You will need to provide your Bitcoin wallet address to the site, which will serve as the destination for your funds. After initiating the withdrawal request, the blackjack site will process the transaction and send the Bitcoin to your wallet.

It is important to note that Bitcoin transactions are usually processed on the blockchain, which can take some time depending on network congestion. The transaction fees associated with Bitcoin transfers may also vary, so it's essential to consider these factors when depositing or withdrawing Bitcoin on blackjack sites.

Using Bitcoin for online blackjack offers several advantages, including faster transactions, lower fees, and enhanced privacy. Additionally, Bitcoin transactions are secure and transparent, thanks to the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology that powers it.

Now that you have a better understanding of the process of using Bitcoin for online blackjack, you can enjoy the convenience and benefits that this digital currency brings to the world of online gambling.

Using Bitcoin for online blackjack has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore them:

Bitcoin offers several advantages for online blackjack players. These include anonymity, faster transactions, lower fees compared to traditional banking methods, and the ability to play from anywhere in the world without geographical restrictions.

Anonymity is a key benefit of using Bitcoin on blackjack sites. Unlike traditional banking methods, Bitcoin transactions do not require personal information, allowing players to maintain their privacy. This is particularly appealing for those who value their anonymity and want to keep their gambling activities discreet.

Bitcoin transactions are known for their speed. When using traditional banking methods, deposits and withdrawals can take several days to process. However, with Bitcoin, transactions are typically completed within minutes, allowing players to enjoy their winnings or start playing without delay.

Lower fees are another advantage of using Bitcoin for online blackjack. Traditional banking methods often charge high transaction fees, especially for international transfers. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, have significantly lower fees, making it a cost-effective option for players who frequently deposit or withdraw funds from their blackjack accounts.

Furthermore, Bitcoin allows players to access online blackjack sites from anywhere in the world. Unlike traditional banking methods that may have geographical restrictions or require additional verification steps, Bitcoin enables players to bypass these limitations and enjoy their favorite blackjack games without any hassle.

Despite its advantages, Bitcoin also comes with potential risks. One of the main concerns is the volatility of Bitcoin prices, which can affect the value of your winnings. Bitcoin is known for its price fluctuations, and if the value of Bitcoin drops significantly after a win, the actual value of your winnings may decrease. This can be a source of frustration for players who prefer stable currencies.

Additionally, not all blackjack sites accept Bitcoin as a payment method. While the popularity of Bitcoin has grown in recent years, there are still some online casinos and blackjack sites that do not support this cryptocurrency. This limitation can restrict the options available to players who prefer to use Bitcoin for their online gambling activities.

It is important for players to carefully consider these potential drawbacks and risks before deciding to use Bitcoin on blackjack sites. While the benefits can be enticing, it is essential to weigh them against the potential challenges and limitations that may arise.

A: Some major benefits include anonymity, faster transaction speeds, lower fees compared to traditional banking methods, no geographical restrictions, and more privacy. Bitcoin allows blackjack players to remain anonymous and withdraw/deposit funds much quicker without high transaction fees.

A: No, Bitcoin is not yet universally accepted on all online blackjack sites. While its popularity has grown substantially, there are still some online casinos and blackjack sites that do not yet support Bitcoin payments and transactions.

A: Drawbacks and risks include volatility in Bitcoin's value, which means the actual dollar value of your winnings could fluctuate. Additionally, limited acceptance among gambling sites restricts options for players wanting to use Bitcoin. There is also a learning curve for players less familiar with cryptocurrencies.

A: One major advantage of Bitcoin is faster transaction speeds. Whereas bank transfers or credit card deposits can take days to process, Bitcoin transactions typically are completed within minutes on blackjack sites. This allows faster access to winnings.

A: One benefit of Bitcoin is users do not have to provide personal/banking information, allowing them to maintain their privacy and remain anonymous. Players should ensure the site is reputable and licensed, but do not need to supply personal info.

A: Yes, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows for anonymous gambling since transactions do not require submitting personal information. Players can maintain discretion without supplying private details.

A: Yes, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to handle transactions. Popular options include software wallets, hardware wallets, and online web-based wallets. You use your wallet address to transfer Bitcoin to/from blackjack sites.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crypto-blackjack-casinos.jpg,0.6392156862745098
Five crypto market predictions that haven't come true  --  yet,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-prediction-nfts-privacy-metaverse-bitcoin,2024-08-30,Cointelegraph,"Success in crypto trading often hinges on a deep understanding of fundamentals, sharp technical analysis skills, or access to market intelligence.

However, the driving force behind price movement frequently comes down to market narratives.

These stories about the market may or may not be fundamentally sound, but respecting them is crucial for success in crypto investing.

There's also a catch: narratives often emerge with force but can just as quickly fade away.

In 2024, several crypto narratives have taken center stage.

Memecoins are one of the most peculiar trends, thriving on hype, humor and strong online communities despite lacking intrinsic value or any real utility. These tokens often attract quick-profit seekers, but their longevity remains in question.

More serious narratives, such as the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization -- both of which aim to solve actual problems -- have also appeared.

DePINs focus on decentralizing infrastructure like energy grids using blockchain, while RWA tokenization refers to tokenizing assets like real estate and commodities. Experts predict tokenized RWAs could unlock a $30 trillion market, although that is yet to materialize.

The dominant narrative is the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The ETFs provide a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, encouraging institutional adoption and legitimizing the market. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF alone has acquired over $20 billion in BTC, fueling optimism and market growth.

As these narratives evolve, the past shows that many trends tend to fade away or fall short of expectations, and Cointelegraph has taken a look at five major market narratives that have yet to pan out.

Lightning Network will make Bitcoin a viable currency for payments

In the 2008 Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to be a digital currency independent of central banks and institutions:

""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.""

One big headwind hampering Bitcoin's use as a payment currency is the network's slow transaction speeds.

Visa can handle 24,000 transactions per second (TPS), Mastercard can perform 5,000, and Bitcoin can currently handle a maximum of seven. The dramatic differences between these digital payment platforms prove that Bitcoin should find a solution to its transaction speeds to become a viable payment currency.

The Lightning Network (LN) is one such solution.

Lightning is a layer-2 protocol developed on the Bitcoin blockchain that can process payments in a parallel, faster, lighter network to remove traffic from the main blockchain. Theoretically, the LN can send 1,000,000 TPS and settle all of them instantly.

Lightning adoption has grown as its number of nodes has increased, and crypto exchanges have adopted the technology. Expectations for Lightning to make Bitcoin a viable payment currency were high, but it hasn't yet lived up to its hype.

Lightning has encountered challenges related to privacy concerns and issues with network liquidity, which add an extra layer of technical complexity to using cryptocurrencies and hinder global adoption.

The L2 solution hasn't failed but needs improvement to handle payments worldwide.

Blockchain is the solution to everything

""Put it on a blockchain"" has long been a term in the business world for hyping something up without providing any real benefits.

The 2017 crypto bull run and initial coin offering boom introduced cryptocurrencies to the broader public.

Blockchain was rapidly promoted as a technology that could solve the issues of any business sector.

Blockchain would improve global distribution systems, eliminate governmental corruption, tamper-proof elections, provide digital identity, establish intellectual property rights -- and the list goes on.

During the 2017 crypto bull run, blockchain became a buzzword as businesses tried to use versions of the technology to improve sectors or to attract attention.

Projects such as PetChain, which used blockchain to track household pets, and Dentacoin, which aimed to create a decentralized ecosystem to improve different aspects of dental care, were some of the more unusual use cases for blockchain.

The hype surrounding blockchain overshadowed its benefits, leading to many projects that often lacked real-world utility. As the dust settled, it became clear that blockchain can address specific challenges, but not every problem requires a blockchain solution.

NFT dream of digital ownership

Non-fungible tokens surged in January 2021, receiving mainstream attention in March 2021, when crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi purchased Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million. Currently, the best offer for this NFT is just over $2,000 or 0.8 Ether (ETH) at current prices, according to OpenSea.

NFTs provided the technical possibility of proving ownership over digital content. This was revolutionary, as it could transform several sectors and create a marketplace for gaming assets and digital collectibles.

NFTs purported to solve a problem for digital artists who could have their artwork easily duplicated or stolen. The token would offer proof of ownership, and the artwork would be included in its minting.

The emergence of a new digital market produced one of the craziest hype cycles in the history of crypto, where buyers bought into a craze to be the first holders of certain NFTs.

Millions of dollars went into NFT collections and computer-generated profile picture (PFP) collections, with only slight differences. The madness peaked, but nowadays, NFTs are being sold for heavy losses.

The reasons for the downfall of NFTs could be related to the use of NFTs for wash trading, the lack of copyright protections provided, and the numerous scams that tarnished their public image, eventually scaring off investors.

Despite the mainstream public associating NFTs with monkey profile pictures, they still offer many potential real-world use cases.

In real estate, they could track historical ownership, while in academics, they can enable immutable certificate verification. Anti-forgery systems for the ticketing sector and new approaches to digital identity and reputation management could be developed through NFT variations like soulbond tokens proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

These applications will only be implemented if NFTs achieve legal backing or widespread acceptance from markets and consumers.

The metaverse will provide a new frontier for social interactions

In 1985, Lucasfilm's Habitat -- a video game for the Commodore 64 -- provided the first example of a virtual cyberspace where users could interact.

Seven years later, in 1992, Neal Stephenson coined the term ""metaverse"" in his novel Snow Crash.

In the 1990s, the metaverse appeared poised to become a reality with the emergence of virtual reality (VR) headsets, heralded as a technological revolution. However, the market was overhyped and didn't gain mainstream traction, mainly due to technological limitations.

However, recent advancements in augmented reality (AR), VR headsets and faster internet bandwidth reignited interest in the metaverse.

The big moment came when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's rebranding to Meta and promised a commitment to investing and developing the metaverse.

The metaverse's crypto narrative revolves around creating a decentralized, immersive digital universe where users can interact, create and transact in a virtual space. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies offered the possibility of enabling true digital ownership and interoperability, as well as potentially developing new digital economic systems.

Like the NFT craze, a flood of money went into metaverse projects using blockchain. Virtual real estate was sold for astronomical amounts of money, such as the 116 digital ""land"" parcels sold for $2.4 million.

However, the sudden rush into leading metaverse platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland was short-lived.

Despite raising millions, DappRadar data indicates that Decentraland has around 300 daily active users, while The Sandbox has about 200.

The metaverse investment hype may have arrived too early. An underdeveloped product failed to meet gameplay expectations and ultimately bored users. Meta lost $16 billion in 2023 and continues to lose money on its metaverse investments. With new technological enhancements, a profitable and active metaverse could yet emerge -- only time will tell.

Privacy coins will catch on as people want to transact privately

Contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrencies do not inherently provide total anonymity. Most operate on a public blockchain, which offers pseudonymity at best -- privacy coins aimed to fix this.

Leading privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were created to preserve anonymity in financial transactions and ensure financial privacy.

These coins surged in the 2017 bull run and made a comeback in 2021. As regulators fixed their eyes on privacy coins, there was renewed interest in them.

However, it looks like regulatory forces are winning the battle so far.

Privacy coins have been stigmatized due to constant regulatory pressure over their association with illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion.

Despite the price surges in 2017 and 202, many exchanges began to delist privacy coins in 2022 to avoid regulatory backlash as pressure mounted, severely limited liquidity and accessibility.

Law enforcement capabilities have also evolved with the improvement of advanced forensic tools and blockchain analytics firms that can track certain transactions. Although Monero wasn't cracked, the fact that other privacy coins could be tracked weakened their selling point of being completely untraceable.

Furthermore, most common crypto users feel safe enough with the pseudonymity offered by mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, with proposals for them to become more private, reducing the appeal of niche privacy coins.","https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-08/0191a388-5cd5-7fa3-b646-cd00a81cfad1",0.2549019607843137

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,511.61, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $302.41 billion. ETH is currently up 47% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 71% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $80.89 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $298 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,511.61.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 118% year over year, compared to a 47% gain for ethereum.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

What is a Cold Wallet?,https://sfctoday.com/what-is-a-cold-wallet/,2024-08-29,sfctoday.com,"This article explores these questions in detail, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding cold wallets

What is a Cold Wallet? As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the interest of cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in storage and transaction processes. To protect their investments, many cryptocurrency users turn to cold wallets -- a form of offline storage that offers enhanced security against hacks and unauthorized access. But what exactly is a cold wallet, how does it work, and why is it considered one of the safest ways to store cryptocurrencies? This article explores these questions in detail, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding cold wallets and their role in the world of digital finance.

Before diving into the specifics of cold wallets, it's essential to understand the basic concept of cryptocurrency wallets. A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. Unlike a physical wallet that holds cash, a cryptocurrency wallet doesn't actually store the currency itself. Instead, it stores the cryptographic keys -- public and private keys -- that are used to access and manage the digital assets on the blockchain.

Public Key: The public key is akin to an account number. It is used to receive funds and can be shared with others without compromising security.

Private Key: The private key is similar to a password or PIN. It is used to sign transactions and access the funds stored in the wallet. The private key must be kept secure, as anyone with access to it can control the associated funds.

There are two primary categories of cryptocurrency wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets.

Hot Wallets: These are wallets connected to the internet, such as mobile apps, desktop applications, or online platforms. They offer convenience and are ideal for frequent transactions. However, their online nature makes them vulnerable to hacks and cyberattacks.

Cold Wallets: These are wallets that are not connected to the internet. Cold wallets are designed to provide an additional layer of security by keeping private keys offline, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access. They are ideal for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies and are less susceptible to hacking attempts.

A cold wallet, also known as cold storage, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that stores private keys in an offline environment. The primary purpose of a cold wallet is to protect the user's digital assets from online threats such as hacking, phishing, and malware. Since the private keys are kept offline, they are inaccessible to hackers who might attempt to steal funds through internet-based attacks.

Cold wallets come in various forms, including hardware wallets, paper wallets, and air-gapped computers. Each type has its unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages, but they all share the common goal of providing enhanced security for cryptocurrency storage.

Hardware Wallets: Hardware wallets are physical devices designed specifically for storing cryptocurrency private keys offline. These devices are often small, USB-like gadgets that can be connected to a computer or mobile device when a transaction needs to be signed. After the transaction is signed, the device can be disconnected, ensuring that the private keys remain offline.

Popular hardware wallets include:

Ledger Nano S/X: One of the most popular hardware wallets, Ledger devices support multiple cryptocurrencies and provide robust security features, including a secure chip and PIN protection.

Trezor: Another well-known hardware wallet, Trezor offers an easy-to-use interface and supports a wide range of digital assets. It also includes advanced security features like passphrase protection.

KeepKey: KeepKey is a sleek hardware wallet that supports major cryptocurrencies and offers a large display for easy transaction verification.

Advantages of Hardware Wallets:

High level of security due to offline storage of private keys.

Requires a backup of the recovery seed to restore funds in case of loss.

Paper Wallets: A paper wallet is a physical document that contains a printed version of a cryptocurrency address and its corresponding private key. The private key is typically presented as both a string of alphanumeric characters and a QR code, which can be scanned for easy access. Paper wallets are generated using a specialized tool that creates the public-private key pair offline.

Advantages of Paper Wallets:

Complete offline storage, making it immune to online hacks.

No hardware or software is required, making it cost-effective.

If the paper wallet is not generated securely, it may be compromised.

Difficult to use for regular transactions, as funds need to be imported into a hot wallet to be spent.

If someone gains access to the paper wallet, they can easily steal the funds.

Air-Gapped Computers: An air-gapped computer is a device that is physically isolated from any network connections, including the internet. This computer is used exclusively for generating and storing private keys, as well as signing cryptocurrency transactions. Once a transaction is signed, it can be transferred to an online device using a USB drive or other removable media.

Advantages of Air-Gapped Computers:

Provides an extremely high level of security by keeping private keys completely isolated from any network.

Ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency or managing funds for institutional investors.

Reduces the risk of malware or other online threats.

Disadvantages of Air-Gapped Computers:

Requires technical knowledge to set up and maintain.

Not practical for everyday use or frequent transactions.

The computer must be secured physically to prevent unauthorized access.

Expensive compared to other cold storage methods.

Cold Storage Solutions for Institutional Investors: For institutional investors, cold wallets are often integrated into more complex cold storage solutions that involve multi-signature wallets, hardware security modules (HSMs), and secure vaults. These solutions are designed to meet the rigorous security and regulatory requirements of large-scale cryptocurrency custodianship.

Advantages of Institutional Cold Storage:

Provides the highest level of security for large-scale cryptocurrency holdings.

Compliance with regulatory standards and audit requirements.

Often includes insurance coverage for stored assets.

May involve longer processing times for transactions due to security procedures.

The primary function of a cold wallet is to store the private keys required to access and manage cryptocurrency holdings offline. Here's a step-by-step overview of how cold wallets work:

Key Generation: The first step in using a cold wallet is to generate a public-private key pair. For hardware wallets, this process is handled by the device itself, typically during the initial setup. For paper wallets, key generation can be done using an offline tool, which ensures that the keys are never exposed to the internet.

Private Key Storage: Once generated, the private key is stored securely in the cold wallet. In the case of hardware wallets, the key is stored on the device's secure chip, inaccessible to external devices or software. For paper wallets, the private key is printed on a physical document and should be stored in a safe place.

Transaction Signing: When the user wants to send cryptocurrency, the transaction must be signed using the private key. For hardware wallets, this involves connecting the device to a computer or mobile device, initiating the transaction, and confirming the details on the hardware wallet itself. The transaction is then signed within the device and broadcast to the blockchain once the device is reconnected to the internet.

For paper wallets or air-gapped computers, the process involves importing the private key into a hot wallet to sign the transaction, after which the funds can be transferred. Alternatively, the transaction can be signed offline and then transferred to an online device for broadcasting.

Recovery and Backup: Cold wallets, especially hardware wallets, typically provide a recovery seed -- a list of words that can be used to restore access to the funds if the device is lost or damaged. This seed should be stored securely, as anyone with access to it can recover the funds. For paper wallets, no digital backup exists, so the physical document itself must be protected.

Enhanced Security: The most significant advantage of cold wallets is the enhanced security they offer. By keeping private keys offline, cold wallets protect against a wide range of online threats, including hacking, phishing, and malware. This makes them ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency or assets intended for long-term holding.

Protection from Exchange Hacks: Cryptocurrency exchanges are a common target for hackers, and storing funds on an exchange can be risky. Cold wallets allow users to maintain full control over their private keys and avoid the risk of losing funds in the event of an exchange breach.

Control and Ownership: With a cold wallet, the user has full control over their private keys and, by extension, their cryptocurrency holdings. This eliminates the need to trust third-party services with the security of their assets.

Long-Term Storage: Cold wallets are ideal for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies. Users who intend to hold onto their digital assets for an extended period without making frequent transactions can benefit from the security and peace of mind provided by cold storage.

Inconvenience for Frequent Transactions: Cold wallets are not designed for frequent transactions. The process of signing transactions and transferring funds using a cold wallet is more complex and time-consuming than using a hot wallet. This makes cold wallets less convenient for users who need to access their funds regularly.

Physical Security Risks: While cold wallets protect against online threats, they are still vulnerable to physical risks. Hardware wallets can be lost, stolen, or damaged, and paper wallets can be destroyed by fire, water, or other environmental factors. Proper physical security measures must be taken to protect these wallets.

Risk of User Error: Setting up and using a cold wallet requires a certain level of technical knowledge. Mistakes made during the setup process, such as failing to back up the recovery seed, can result in the permanent loss of funds. Users must take care to follow best practices and secure their wallets properly.

Initial Cost: Hardware wallets typically require an initial purchase, which can be a barrier for some users. While the cost is relatively low compared to the value of the assets they protect, it is still an upfront expense that users must consider.

To maximize the security and effectiveness of a cold wallet, users should follow these best practices:

Purchase from Reputable Sources: Only buy hardware wallets from reputable manufacturers and authorized retailers. Avoid purchasing second-hand devices, as they may be compromised.

Secure Backup of Recovery Seed: When setting up a hardware wallet, carefully write down the recovery seed and store it in a secure location. Consider using a fireproof and waterproof safe or a metal backup solution to protect the seed from physical damage.

Keep Private Keys Offline: Never store private keys on an internet-connected device. Ensure that all key generation and storage processes are done offline.

Use a Separate Device for Cold Wallet Management: For air-gapped computers, use a dedicated device that is never connected to the internet. This reduces the risk of malware infection and unauthorized access.

Regularly Check Hardware Wallet Firmware: Keep the firmware of your hardware wallet up to date to ensure that you have the latest security features and protections.

Limit Access: Only share access to your cold wallet or recovery seed with trusted individuals, and only if absolutely necessary. The fewer people who have access, the lower the risk of unauthorized transactions.

A cold wallet is one of the most secure methods for storing cryptocurrencies, offering protection against online threats such as hacking and malware. By keeping private keys offline, cold wallets provide users with peace of mind, knowing that their digital assets are safe from cybercriminals. Whether in the form of a hardware wallet, paper wallet, or air-gapped computer, cold wallets are an essential tool for anyone serious about securing their cryptocurrency investments.

However, with this enhanced security comes the responsibility of proper setup, backup, and physical security measures. Users must take care to follow best practices and remain vigilant in protecting their cold wallets from both online and physical threats.

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, cold wallets will remain a cornerstone of secure digital asset management, providing a reliable solution for long-term storage and protection of valuable crypto holdings.",https://sfctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/What-is-a-Cold-Wallet.jpg,0.2705882352941176

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $307.43 billion. It's up 47% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $307.43 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $298 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 71% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,522.45.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 120% and ETH is up 47% year over year.

You might be more comfortable using online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Interactive Brokers, Webull, and Robinhood.

Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal have options for buying ETH. Cryptocurrency ATMs also allow for direct purchases.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1607843137254903
Best Altcoins to Buy: Top Picks Based on Market Analysis and Growth Potential,https://coinpaper.com/5236/best-altcoins-to-buy,2024-08-29,Coinpaper,"Discovering the best altcoins to buy can be a game-changer for those eager to dive into cryptocurrencies.

Avalanche is also popular among investors. Its high throughput and low latency are lauded, making it suitable for various applications. Avalanche's sub-second finality and compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts increase its appeal.

DeFi tokens represent a new era of financial services without traditional intermediaries. Uniswap is a well-known DeFi token that serves as a decentralized exchange (DEX). UNI's governance token allows holders to vote on important protocol changes. The platform's ease of use and liquidity pools attract many users.

Chainlink is another important DeFi token. It provides decentralized oracles that bring off-chain data into smart contracts. This capability is crucial for many DeFi applications, making LINK a strong investment choice. Chainlink's partnerships with major players add to its credibility.

Aave is also noteworthy. This decentralized lending protocol lets users earn interest on deposits and borrow assets. The AAVE token gives holders governance rights and access to reduced fees on the platform. Aave's robust security measures and growing user base make it a solid option.

Privacy coins offer enhanced anonymity features, crucial for users who value confidentiality. Monero is a leading privacy coin known for its strong emphasis on privacy. It uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to obfuscate transactions, making it challenging to trace transaction history.

Zcash is another prominent privacy coin. It offers optional anonymity through its zk-SNARKs cryptographic technology, which enables shielded transactions. This feature allows Zcash to provide both transparent and private transactions.

Dash also falls into the privacy coin category. It provides optional privacy features through PrivateSend, which mixes coins to obscure their origin. Dash's focus on fast, low-cost transactions makes it versatile for various uses, including everyday spending.

Several strategies should be considered when investing in altcoins. These include long-term holding, active trading, and diversification, each offering unique benefits and risks.

Long-term holding, or ""HODLing,"" involves purchasing altcoins and holding them for an extended period. This strategy relies on the belief that the coin's value will increase significantly over time.

Popular altcoins for long-term investment often include Ethereum and Avalanche.

Investors aim to benefit from long-term growth by holding these assets through market fluctuations and holding altcoins. This strategy requires patience and a strong belief in the future potential of the chosen altcoins.

Active trading involves buying and selling altcoins frequently to capitalize on short-term market movements. This strategy is best suited for those who can dedicate time to monitoring market trends and executing trades quickly.

Platforms like Binance and Coinbase Pro are popular choices for active traders. Tools such as technical analysis charts and signals are essential for success in this approach.

Active traders often focus on coins like Solana and Chainlink, as these assets are known for their volatility and trading volume.

Diversification involves spreading investments across different altcoins to mitigate risk. By holding various assets, investors can protect themselves from the downturn of any single coin.

A diversified portfolio might include top performers like Ethereum and BNB and emerging altcoins like NEAR Protocol and Optimism.

This strategy allows investors to benefit from different sectors of the crypto market, such as DeFi and NFTs, without putting all their capital into one asset.

Investors should continuously research and adjust their portfolios. Crypto Twitter and news outlets provide valuable insights and updates on market trends and sentiment, aiding in making informed decisions.

Investing in altcoins carries significant risks. One effective way to manage these risks is by diversifying your portfolio. Don't put all your funds into one altcoin. Spread your investments across various altcoins to minimize potential losses.

Market volatility is another risk. Crypto markets can be volatile. Keep an eye on market trends and price movements. Set stop-loss orders to sell automatically if the price drops below a certain level.

Research thoroughly. Before investing, understand the technology behind the altcoin, its use cases, and the team involved. Follow reputable sources and experts on social media. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, often shares insights on promising projects and trends.

Secure your assets. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Store your cryptocurrencies in hardware wallets rather than exchanges to protect against hacks.

Stay informed. Visit Forbes Advisor, Crypto News, and U.S. News for up-to-date information.

Lastly, only invest money you can afford to lose. The crypto market is unpredictable, and preparing for any outcome is crucial.

Several trends are currently shaping the altcoin market, driving innovation and investment. From NFTs to Layer 2 solutions, these developments are capturing investors' attention.

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have exploded in popularity. They represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as art, music, and virtual real estate. People are buying NFTs for their potential value and status symbol.

Platforms like Solana and Ethereum are leaders in NFT transactions. Artists and creators prefer these networks for their reliability and lower transaction fees. This space is rapidly growing, with major brands and celebrities entering the market. The interest in digital collectibles and ownership rights suggests NFTs aren't just a fad but a significant innovation.

Another trend to watch is Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs. DAOs use blockchain technology to create organizations governed by smart contracts and consensus rather than central authorities, democratizing decision-making.

Popular DAOs like MakerDAO and Uniswap have influenced the DeFi space. Tokens like Ethereum and Polkadot support these frameworks. The transparency and security provided by DAOs can revolutionize industries beyond finance, such as gaming and supply chains. Investors are keen on these projects for their long-term potential.

Layer 2 solutions aim to improve blockchain scalability by processing transactions off the main chain. This approach reduces congestion and fees, and it is essential as mainstream adoption grows.

Projects like Optimism and Arbitrum are leading examples of Layer 2 technologies. Ethereum has benefited significantly from these innovations. The Layer 2 trend is vital for ensuring that blockchain technology can handle increased demand. Crypto Twitter analysts highlight the importance of these solutions for future space growth.

When investing in altcoins, it's essential to understand the legal and regulatory environment.

Regulatory Landscape: Different countries have varying regulations concerning altcoins. For instance, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stringent rules around cryptocurrencies, treating many altcoins as securities.

Compliance: Altcoin projects must often meet KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. This ensures better transparency and helps prevent illegal activities.

Security: Investors should be cautious about the security measures of altcoin projects. Regulatory bodies sometimes mandate stringent security protocols to safeguard investor funds.

Tax Implications: Trading altcoins can have tax consequences. Financial gains from altcoin investments are often subject to capital gains tax. It's crucial to consult with a tax advisor to understand these implications fully.

Legal Risks: Altcoin projects can face legal challenges, particularly if they fail to comply with the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Legal scrutiny can affect the value and stability of the altcoin.

Market News: Recently, regulatory updates have been a hot topic on Crypto Twitter, with industry experts like Anthony Pompliano discussing potential impacts. He stated, ""Navigating the regulatory landscape is crucial for the future of altcoins and their adoption.""

Project Transparency: Look for projects that are transparent about their regulatory compliance. Projects like Ethereum have clear communication channels, informing investors about regulatory developments.

Legal and regulatory considerations are crucial in the viability and stability of altcoin investments. Always stay informed about the latest regulations affecting the sector.

Keeping altcoins secure is essential. Both online and offline methods are available, each with its benefits.

Hot Wallets: These wallets are connected to the internet and easily accessible. Examples include mobile and web wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.

Cold Wallets are offline wallets that offer added security. Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor are popular choices.

Recent reports highlight that major exchanges like Binance are enhancing security measures following hacks targeting hot wallets. This underlines the importance of using both hot and cold storage to protect your altcoins effectively.

Ensuring the safety of altcoins involves a mix of good practices and using the right tools. This makes it crucial for investors to stay updated and vigilant.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1724781913/Whats_App_Image_2024_08_27_at_18_56_40_266b6db652.jpg,0.5529411764705883
Why the Valuation Gap Between Ethereum and Bitcoin is Increasing,http://topnews.in/why-valuation-gap-between-ethereum-and-bitcoin-increasing-2414907,2024-08-29,topnews.in,"Cryptocurrency investors have most likely heard the argument that Ethereum could one day surpass Bitcoin in terms of market valuation the gap between valuation of these two major cryptocurrencies would reduce with time. However, the opposite has been going on for the last few months. The interest in Ethereum has declined and Bitcoin is maintaining its supremacy. Let us check what has been going on with Ethereum during the last few months.

Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced a significant market downturn, evidenced by a $44.5 million outflow from Ethereum ETFs, primarily driven by Grayscale's ETHE. The decline is further reflected in Ethereum's trading volume, transaction count, and price, with the cryptocurrency failing to breach key resistance levels. Institutional interest appears to be waning, even as Bitcoin ETFs enjoy inflows. Despite these challenges, some analysts highlight that the recent decline is not as severe as in previous years. Ethereum's price remains vulnerable, trading within a critical range that could determine its near-term trajectory.

Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. recorded substantial net outflows of $44.5 million last week, marking a concerning trend for the cryptocurrency. This decline was largely spearheaded by Grayscale's ETHE, which saw $118 million in outflows, overshadowing the minor inflows recorded by other newly launched Ethereum ETFs. This exodus highlights a growing risk aversion among investors, further pressuring ETH's market performance.

Ethereum's trading volume and transaction count have plummeted, reflecting a broader decline in investor confidence. The 7-day moving average of daily trading volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped sharply, from $6.56 billion on July 26 to just $2.9 billion by the end of August. Additionally, the monthly transaction count fell to 27.27 million, a level not seen since May 2020, underscoring the significant retreat in market activity.

Ethereum has struggled to break above a crucial resistance level, contributing to its ongoing price consolidation. On Saturday, ETH tested the resistance at $2,817 but failed to sustain its gains, leading to a subsequent retracement. The price action formed a long-legged Doji candle, signaling indecision among traders and confirming a bearish reversal. This has kept ETH confined within a key rectangle pattern, with potential implications for future price movements.

The lack of institutional interest in Ethereum is becoming increasingly evident, particularly when compared to Bitcoin. Despite the broader market anticipating a potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve, Ethereum has not seen the same level of institutional inflows as Bitcoin. The contrast is stark, with Bitcoin ETFs posting seven consecutive days of net inflows, even as Grayscale's GBTC experienced outflows. This trend may indicate a shifting sentiment among institutional investors, who seem to be favoring Bitcoin over Ethereum in the current market environment.

While Ethereum's recent performance has been lackluster, it's worth noting that the decline in activity this August has been less severe compared to previous years. According to Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han, the decrease in ether trading volumes this August was a modest 7.7%, which is significantly lower than the average 16.8% decline observed over the last five years. This suggests that while Ethereum is facing headwinds, the current downturn may not be as dire as historical patterns might suggest.

Ethereum is currently trading around $2,570, down nearly 3% on the day, with significant liquidations recorded over the past 24 hours. For ETH to stage a recovery, it must break above the upper resistance of the current rectangle pattern, potentially reclaiming a critical support level that has held for nearly six months. A successful breakout could see Ethereum rally towards the next resistance level at $3,542, and potentially challenge its yearly high at $4,093. However, significant resistance at the 200-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages may pose challenges to this upward trajectory.

Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has seen remarkable adoption, attracting hundreds of millions of users and gaining the attention of mainstream investment firms. As a decentralized platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries, Ethereum stands as a technological powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space. Recent developments, including advancements in Layer 2 (L2) solutions and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology, have further strengthened Ethereum's fundamentals. Despite market volatility, Ethereum's robust technological infrastructure and growing ecosystem continue to position it as a leading force in the blockchain industry.

Since its release in 2015, Ethereum has experienced exponential adoption, attracting hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Its decentralized nature has captured the attention of mainstream investment firms and payment applications, establishing Ethereum as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. The platform's ability to host smart contracts and dApps without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference has set it apart in the digital asset landscape.

Ethereum goes beyond being just another cryptocurrency by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform for smart contracts and dApps. Central to Ethereum's operations is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node. The EVM executes bytecode and smart contracts -- self-executing agreements coded directly into the blockchain -- ensuring transactions are trustless and automated. This innovation eliminates the need for intermediaries in contractual agreements, representing a paradigm shift in how transactions are conducted across various industries.

Ethereum's platform supports a wide array of cryptocurrencies, underscoring its significant market influence. As of March 2024, 10 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies are either based on or linked to Ethereum, highlighting the platform's foundational role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its versatile framework enables the development of diverse applications, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, and has seen widespread integration by major organizations exploring blockchain technology.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has emphasized the network's ""crazy strong"" fundamentals, countering claims of weakness during the current market cycle. Key to this strength is the significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum's Layer 2 (L2) solutions, which now average below $0.01. Buterin attributed this cost efficiency to the implementation of EIP-4844 and the introduction of dedicated block spaces, known as ""blobs,"" for data transmitted from L2 blockchains. Additionally, Ethereum L2 solutions like Arbitrum have seen their fees drop dramatically, with daily transaction counts consistently surpassing 1 million, further demonstrating the network's sustained activity and user engagement.

Buterin also highlighted the progress of Optimism and Arbitrum, both of which have reached critical milestones in their development, referred to as ""Stage 1."" These platforms are essential to Ethereum's long-term scalability strategy, offering faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the main Ethereum network. The advancements in these L2 solutions are crucial as they enhance Ethereum's ability to handle a growing number of transactions, ensuring the network remains competitive and accessible.

Ethereum has made significant strides in improving the user experience, particularly in the realm of cross-L2 wallets, which now require less manual intervention when switching networks. This simplification enhances the overall usability of the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more attractive to both new and existing users. Furthermore, the maturation of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology has expanded its accessibility for decentralized application (dApp) developers, enabling more sophisticated privacy and security features within the Ethereum platform.

Buterin pointed to the ongoing innovation within Ethereum's ecosystem, particularly in privacy and security. The evolution of ZK tooling and the emergence of second-generation privacy solutions, such as 0xbow.io, underscore Ethereum's commitment to advancing privacy technology. Additionally, the development of Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (STARKs) is vital to Ethereum's long-term security and decentralization goals. These advancements, coupled with the expanding ecosystem for identity, reputation, and credentials, are expected to drive further adoption and strengthen Ethereum's position in the market.

Looking ahead, Ethereum's long-term investment potential appears optimistic, fueled by its continuous technological advancements, expanding adoption, and the broadening scope of its applications. As the platform continues to innovate and evolve, it is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the rapidly growing blockchain industry, making it a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to the future of decentralized technology.",,0.09019607843137245
