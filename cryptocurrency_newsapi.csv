Top Crypto Exchanges in 2024: Guide,https://u.today/guides/top-crypto-exchanges-in-2024-guide,2024-08-27,u.today,"Despite the market sending mixed signals for crypto traders, it is safe to say that volatility is back on the market. As such, this is the right moment to check out the best crypto exchanges for trading -- a cornerstone element of the global crypto ecosystem.

In this guide, we are going to indicate the most popular crypto exchanges and share some tips on how to choose the best crypto platform in 2024.

In 2024, there are a plethora of cryptocurrency exchanges available for traders with different backgrounds, deposit sizes, trading styles and so on.

As of 2024, Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken are typically listed among the top cryptocurrency exchanges.

Based on a variety of parameters, there is a list of the best cryptocurrency exchanges for trading and liquidity management (in no particular order):

In the following guide, we are going to focus on their specifications, pros and cons and the opportunities these platforms unlock.

A cryptocurrency exchange (crypto exchange, crypto trading platform) is an online service where users can buy and sell various digital assets (cryptocurrencies). These exchanges operate not unlike stocks, index, or ForEx markets but deal exclusively in digital currencies.

Exchanges typically offer various tools for market analysis, trading and secure storage of assets. In practice, crypto exchanges are often used as crypto wallets for only storing, receiving and transferring cryptocurrency with no conversion operations.

They play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing trading opportunities, enabling price discovery and facilitating the broader adoption of digital currencies among new generations of internet users.

As per the CoinMarketCap tracker, there are thousands of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in 2024. Due to this fact, choosing the right one might be challenging for newcomers.

As such, the platform should be secure, user-friendly, multi-product, and has to demonstrate stellar reputation in order to become part of the top crypto exchanges list.

Here is the simplest classification of cryptocurrency exchanges you need to find the one that suits you best:

On decentralized crypto exchanges, you are the one responsible for the keys from your account, while centralized platforms manage the keypairs themselves: You just log in via familiar tools.

Some exchanges only work with tokens issued on one blockchain, i.e., Bitcoin or Ethereum (for ERC-20 tokens), while the rest of crypto services work with a variety of blockchains.

Then, some exchanges accept fiat currencies from cards and bank accounts, while others only work with crypto: To top up your account, you already need to get some crypto from a third-party platform.

The vast majority of the largest crypto exchanges in the cryptocurrency world are centralized, many-blockchain, crypto-to-fiat platforms.

Now we are ready to proceed to the guide of the most popular crypto exchanges in 2024. The overview will focus on history, specifications and the main opportunities offered by the platforms.

What is a Desktop Crypto Wallet?

Further, since desktop wallets only connect to the internet when necessary, they are less exposed to online crypto threats, such as hacking and phishing.

That doesn't mean they're not immune to attacks. Desktop wallets are still susceptible to risks like malware and phishing attacks that could compromise the user's computer. If, for some reason, your computer gets damaged and you don't have a backup, you've likely lost your funds too.

Instead, the wallet divides the private key into three ""key-shares,"" each protected by a recovery password and stored in separate locations -- on the user's device, in cloud storage, and within the Web3 Wallet. This method significantly mitigates the risk associated with centralized storage of private keys and enhances overall security.

Pros and Cons of Crypto Desktop Wallets

While they're suitable for those who frequently work with their laptops and PCs and need to manage their crypto assets on-site, it's fair to lay out some of the advantages and disadvantages of desktop wallets. Here are some pros explained:

Now, let's go with the bad:

Best Desktop Crypto Wallets: Factors To Consider

With various options available, it's important to consider several factors to ensure the wallet you choose meets your security, compatibility, and usability needs.

Security Features

A fundamental aspect of any crypto wallet is control over private keys. Choosing a wallet that allows you to manage your private keys directly is vital. This ensures that you, not a third party, have complete control over your funds, providing an additional layer of security.

For enhanced security, look for wallets that support two-factor authentication (2FA). This feature requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device, before granting access to your wallet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Similarly, check the wallet's encryption standards and key storage methods. Strong encryption protocols and secure key storage are critical in protecting your wallet from potential breaches and unauthorized access. A wallet with robust backup options ensures that you can easily regain access to your digital assets, minimizing the risk of permanently losing your funds.

Compatibility and Usability

It might be obvious, but make sure your wallet is compatible with your device and operating system, whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Moreover, make sure your wallet supports hardware integration if you're looking for extra compatibility and usability with other devices. There are certain additional features to keep an eye on. For example, some desktop wallets offer built-in conversion features, enabling users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. This allows you to rebalance your portfolio without transferring funds to an external exchange.

Also, make sure the wallet you choose supports the cryptocurrency you plan to use. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to download it.

Development and Support

Choose a wallet that is actively developed and regularly updated with the latest technological advancements and security patches. Moreover, check for customer support services and make sure it is at least decent enough to guide you through basic questions.

Again, desktop wallets are not a replacement for hardware wallets, which are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency over the long term. Desktop wallets, however, are suitable for holding smaller amounts that you need to access more frequently.

What are Some Other Alternatives to Desktop Wallets?

Cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms and colors, each offering distinct advantages and features tailored to different user needs. Hot wallets and cold storage are two popular methods of storing digital assets today.

Let's begin with hot wallets.

Hot wallets are software applications designed to manage and transact cryptocurrencies. These wallets are always connected to the internet and are available on various platforms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop, of course. What makes these applications popular is their ease of use and accessibility, making them a common choice for daily transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Types of Hot Wallets

Web Wallets: Typically installed as browser extensions on popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. They allow you to manage, store, and transact cryptocurrencies directly through web browsers. They often support dApps, Web3 applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Mobile Wallets: Designed for iOS and Android devices, mobile wallets offer the convenience of managing digital assets on the go. However, be careful of exposing your phone to malware, and beware that there's always the chance you may lose the device.

Cold Wallets: The Secure Alternative

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. Their offline status greatly reduces the risk of hacking and other online threats.

Cold wallets, another term for it, are especially suited for those looking to store crypto for the long run and seek a device with a level of security. Here are some of the key features of cold wallets:

A desktop wallet for cryptocurrencies is a software tool designed to be installed on a user's computer, enabling them to store, manage, and transfer digital currencies securely.

One of the key features of these wallets is that they grant users direct control over their private keys, ensuring that they maintain full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

Can I Access my Desktop Wallet From Multiple Devices?

Typically, desktop wallets are designed to maximize security by being used on a single device. But some wallets offer features that allow users to sync their wallet data between devices, often through cloud storage or other methods. It's essential to review the specific features of the wallet you are considering to understand its capabilities regarding multi-device access.

What to Do in Case I Lose My Desktop Wallet?

If you lose access to your desktop wallet or the stored device, you can restore it using a recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. This phrase is a critical backup that allows you to regain access to your digital assets. Make sure you save your recovery phrase securely and never share it with anyone, as it is the key to restoring your wallet.

Closing Thoughts

Desktop wallets have become popular among crypto enthusiasts because they provide a secure environment for managing various cryptocurrencies. This guide on the best desktop crypto wallets highlights some of the top options in the market today.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_desktop_wallets_cover.jpg,0.388235294117647
The U.S. Dollar's Resilience: Strength Or Illusion?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4719602-vaneck-crypto-monthly-recap-august-2024,2024-09-06,Seeking Alpha,"One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun.

By Matthew Sigel & Patrick Bush

In August, most crypto assets saw significant declines amid rising market volatility and a risk-off environment driven by macroeconomic factors such as the yen carry trade implosion.

Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below.

Most crypto assets fell sharply in August as fundamental usage and financial statistics slipped against the broader market backdrop of rising volatility. For the month of August, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 11%, Ethereum (ETH-USD) -24%, and Solana (SOL-USD) -21%, vs. the S&P +2% and the Nasdaq +1%. The market capitalization of all Smart Contract Platforms (SCP) ended August (-12%) lower than it closed in July.

Though the precipitating event for the dismal price performance was a risk-off typhoon spawned by the yen carry trade, general sentiment for crypto remained poor even after the event. The apex of the pandemonium was August 5, when BTC wicked as low as $49k while ETH crashed to $2.1k after opening the month at around $64.6k and $3.2k respectively. Though Bitcoin has regained some of its value since the ""flash crash,"" sitting around $ 58k at the time of writing, ETH is still wallowing around $2.5k. The impact of the yen carry trade implosion translated into BTC and ETH's August 30-day volatility climbing (+48%) and (+52%) higher than the previous month, as well as Bitcoin's 90-day correlation with the Nasdaq rising to an 18-month high of 38%.

Besides macro factors driving prices lower, blockchain usage deteriorated in August. For example, daily active usership was down (-10%) in August, fees generated fell (-12%), and DEX volumes sagged (-4%) compared to July. The German & US Governments also transferred 62k Bitcoin to exchanges, presumably for sale, while Mt. Gox and Gemini bankruptcy distributions totaled another 124k Bitcoin. That's $11B in non-repeatable sales, roughly equivalent to the net inflows to Bitcoin ETPs in the first two months of trading. Lastly, driving weak price action at month-end, the SEC sent a Wells Notice to OpenSea, one of the largest NFT exchanges, claiming that the company is an unregistered broker. The action is another sign that regulation by enforcement may continue in the US unless Donald Trump wins the election.

One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun. A very important DeFi ""primitive,"" WBTC, or ""Wrapped Bitcoin,"" is a token on Ethereum that is backed by Bitcoin custodied at the crypto exchange Bitgo. Someone who wishes to use mint WBTC can send their Bitcoin to Bitgo, which then issues the WBTC on Ethereum. WBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, held by Bitgo, which provides attestations of holdings.

At the time of writing, more than 153k BTC worth $9.2B have been ""wrapped"" into WBTC for use in Ethereum's DeFi. As part of the new partnership agreement, Bitgo will move custody of WBTC outside of the United States to three different Asian countries. The crypto community reacted negatively to these developments due to the negative perception of Justin Sun and past issues with other projects brought under his aegis, like USDD and TrueUSD. MakerDAO, the entity that runs the permissionless crypto-backed stablecoin DAI, passed a governance proposal banning wBTC as used for collateral to create DAI. To seize the initiative, Coinbase announced its own wrapped version of BTC called wbBTC. At the same time, Bitcoin L2 Babylon unexpectedly declared the launch of their mainnet the week after Bitgo's new custody announcement. Meanwhile, existing competitors such as tBTC and BTC.b saw modest inflows of 250 BTC and 50 BTC.

Daily Memecoin Volumes on Solana Fall Back to 2023 Levels

Source: Dune @ally as of 8/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Click to enlarge

Solana (-21%) has had a mixed month as several underlying issues surfaced to generate a minor FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) cycle. Speculation is the lifeblood of crypto, and no more is this a reality than on Solana, which accounts for ~22% of all DEX trading, of which 47% has been memecoin trading since June 1, 2024. It is apparent to many in the crypto community that Solana memecoin trading is rife with fraudulent activity. A coin supposedly associated with Donald Trump was ""rugged"" for $2M, someone hacked McDonald's Instagram account to announce a memecoin that eventually scammed buyers out of $700k, while other tokens with liquidities of <$100k are seeing daily trading volumes >$10M. The result has been that many traders on Solana have lost money due to memecoins. It is estimated that only 0.76% of wallets on Solana's top memecoin platform, pump.fun, are profitable.

Many small traders are catching on to the fact that memecoin trading is usually a zero-sum game. This change in sentiment has driven memecoin trading down (-43%) month-to-month while total DEX volume on Solana is down (-48%). As a result, Solana's monthly fees have declined (35%). On the positive front for Solana, the first (and second) spot SOL ETF debuted in Brazil, while the interesting DePIN project Grass announced its token airdrop, and the perpetual futures platform Drift launched a prediction market. The stablecoin of PayPal, PYUSD, reached $664M in supply on Solana, nearly double the $345M of PYUSD on Ethereum. In August, the total supply of all stablecoins on Solana reached $3.9B, 160% greater than a year earlier.

A budding challenge for the widespread adoption of Solana is its blockchain's massive size in computer storage space. Solana is designed to process tens of thousands of transactions per second and has consistently demonstrated this capability. Blockchain transactions are essentially ""writes"" to each blockchain's database of information. The more transactions, the more ""writes"" occur, and this causes more data to be stored on a blockchain. While Bitcoin's blocks are around 1.6MB in size and occur every 10 minutes, Solana blocks can be as large as 128MB, and these blocks occur around every half second. The result is that the Bitcoin blockchain is around 550 GB in size for 15 years of history, while Solana's chain is around 150TB (272x bigger) for roughly 4.5 years of history.

This is an issue because it makes it very difficult and expensive for people to store its history and query its contents. Looking at past events or simple things like an account's historical balances is cost-prohibitive. Solana expects private entities to spin up to provide services for those wishing to comb Solana's history. Allium, an S-tier data services provider, is one of the few entities that can effectively assess Solana's history. This presents a challenge to anyone who wants to create assets on Solana.

If an audit is to occur or an issue crops up, someone has to spend large sums of money to untangle Solana's historical archive. The instability of Solana's consensus mechanism and its history of outages add to the challenges posed by Solana's substantial history. Because of these two issues, it is nearly impossible to prove that Solana's chain has operated without any faults (double spending of currency) and without sifting through the entire chain. Though this is a challenge with any blockchain, Solana's massive data output creates novel difficulties that are not posed by lower throughput chains. It must also be noted that while history is challenging to verify by new nodes, real-time verification of chain functionality can be verified by anyone with a full node. Newer high-throughput blockchains, such as Aptos and Sui, have different design philosophies that seek to address these challenges. But realistically, Solana's big data limitations will likely plague other high-capacity blockchains.

Hosted on the Polygon blockchain, Polymarket has crept into the news cycle during the US presidential election season as an exciting use case of crypto technology. Polymarket is a permissionless prediction market that allows users to create betting markets and speculate on the outcome of off-chain events in politics, sports, finance, and popular culture. The smart contracts that power Polymarket are hosted on the Polygon blockchain. These smart contracts receive, interpret, and execute better payoffs using data brought on the chain by the crypto ""oracle"" Uma. The pseudo-anonymous nature of Polymarket combined with its limitless, global accessibility allows it to incorporate valuable information more efficiently and dynamically than is possible outside of crypto. Because people can create any market with any type of outcome without a central party to prevent the flow of information by limiting markets or betting, Polymarket is arguably a more accurate prediction engine than any web2 betting platform. While web2 companies can be pressured to censor or alter markets, Polymarket's decentralized system prevents outside parties from stopping the incentivized transfer of knowledge that prediction markets enable.

The recent attention on Polymarket has focused on its political prediction markets, such as the winner of the US presidential election or the winners of key US congressional races. Polymarket is generating enormous controversy with detractors contending that public opinion can be swayed by large-pocketed investors who manipulate prediction markets. Regardless, Polymarket usage has surged, with over $440M in wagers placed by over 60k monthly active traders in August. Recently, its data feeds have been integrated into Bloomberg terminals worldwide. Despite its popularity, Polymarket has only generated $17.9k in fees for the Polygon blockchain where it is hosted.

Polymarket's Monthly Active Users Up 3600% since EoY 2024

In stablecoin news, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin USDT, has shelved plans to launch its blockchain, citing market saturation. Another interesting development is that Maker, the entity behind the collateral-backed stablecoin DAI, has decided to rebrand to SKY. As part of its move, Maker will upgrade its DAI token to USDS and change its governance token, MAKER, to SKY. Users can choose to upgrade their existing DAI or MAKER tokens to receive token rewards and the Sky Savings Rate, which will only be available in certain jurisdictions. As part of the sweeping changes Maker calls its ""Endgame,"" Maker will allow independent entities called Stars to launch innovative stablecoins. Meanwhile, Circle, the creator of USDC, has launched the Euro-backed stablecoin EURC on Base.

Meanwhile, the VanEck-backed Agora stablecoin1 has proven to be one of the fastest-growing stablecoins in crypto. Since its launch on August 19, it has grown to $57.5M on Avalanche and Ethereum. Agora intends to grow rapidly by expanding its presence to other chains such as Sui. This would make Agora the first fiat-backed stablecoin on Sui. Agora's strategy is to grow through revenue-sharing agreements and distribution partnerships. Some target partnerships include protocols, on-chain applications, centralized exchanges, and other important entities in crypto. Nick Van Eck, founder of Agora, believes that stablecoins will become a $10T asset class expanding to enterprises issuing their own stablecoins. For more on stablecoins, please look out for our upcoming research piece on the topic.

Breaking Down Ethereum's Struggles

One of the most confounding topics has been the consistent underperformance of ETH since the beginning of the bull market in crypto assets in November 2023. Of the 22 major L1 projects that we track, Ethereum ranks 13th with a yearly return of 62%. While this absolute return is spectacular, this is less than ½ of BTC's 138% return, and far below Solana's astounding 624% return over the same period of time. During periods of crypto price pullbacks, Ethereum has also underperformed. For example, over the past 90 days, ETH (-30%) ranks 12th place among the group of 22 and has been outshined by competitors such as BNB (-5%), Tron's TRX (+37%) and TON (-3%). More recently, over the past 30 days, ETH has been an abysmal (-23%), which ranks it 19th among the 22 layer 1 blockchains we track.

ETH is the 18th Worst Performing Asset Over the Last 30 Days

We attribute ETH's dismal performance to the following factors:

Decline in revenues Speculation moving to high throughput blockchains L2 blockchains cannibalize Ethereum's revenue items like transaction fees and MEV Deliberate policy choices Ethereum has reduced fees for its L2 customers Ethereum relies upon L2s Value Extraction by Service EntitiesL2s, data availability blockchains, staking, and re-staking take away Ethereum's value

Without question, the best use case for public blockchains at this early stage is speculation. The current monetization of SCPs relies on people moving assets or trading them on-chain. This generates revenue for blockchains through transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), ultimately bringing value to tokenholders. Without speculation driving on-chain revenues, a blockchain must bank its worth on uncertain long-term potential.

Ethereum's Decline in the Face of Faster Competitors

Ethereum was once the epicenter of crypto speculation because it was the first smart contract platform to attract novel projects and allow users to speculate upon their tokens. However, the competitive landscape has changed, with more capable blockchains eating into Ethereum's once-dominant position.

These chains apply advancements in distributed systems technology to handle more transaction throughput and faster transaction processing. While Ethereum can process ~15 TPS per second with transaction confirmation times measured in minutes, chains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos can process thousands per second with confirmation latency measured in seconds. Simultaneously, the new crop of blockchains has figured out how to parallelize transactions that can be processed alongside each other. This allows transactions unrelated to congested areas on the blockchain to execute their logic unencumbered. Ethereum only allows transactions to process sequentially, and if one part of Ethereum is bombarded with demand, transactions on other parts are held in queue. As a result, the user experience for Ethereum's traders is clunky, and the number of individuals who can utilize Ethereum is limited.

Because of Ethereum's bottlenecks, developers building novel applications are increasingly deploying their projects to chains that can accommodate a better user experience and more users. These projects are also deploying their tokens to these new chains. Many innovative, non-financial crypto projects, like Helium and Hivemapper, reside on more advanced blockchains. Slowly, Ethereum is not only losing its dominance as a place to speculate, but it is also losing the tokens that appeal to speculators.

Ethereum's Diminishing Fee Revenues

Quantifying Ethereum's loss of its pole position among blockchains, since 2022, the share of all blockchain fees received by Ethereum has fallen from 86% to 33%, while its share of DEX volume has declined from 42% to 29%.

Ethereum's Shift to Layer-2: A Double-Edged Sword?

Ethereum's solution to improve its scalability, pushing transactions to L2 blockchains, has thus far failed to drive value to ETH. Not only do the L2 blockchains increasingly cut into Ethereum economics through multiple pathways, but they also offer a suboptimal user experience while still offering far less transaction throughput than Ethereum competitors.

On the first dimension, value accrual to ETH, pushing transactions to its orbiting blockchains, also moves revenue-generating components like MEV and transaction fees to those L2 chains. Though L2s remit value to Ethereum by posting proofs and batches of transactions, Ethereum's share of transaction fees in its ecosystem (Ethereum + L2s) alone has dropped from 98% to 89% since 2022. MEV is difficult to calculate but can be approximated as a portion of DEX volumes. At the start of 2023, Ethereum commanded 90% of DEX volumes in its ecosystem, whereas today, that share is around 52%. The MEV that is generated by these DEX volumes accrues to the L2s instead of Ethereum.

The shift to L2s has also expanded the amount of available Ethereum blockspace, which has lowered the price of transactions. To make transactions even less costly, Ethereum passed EIP-4844, which created a new data processing lane for batches of L2 transactions. This has reduced revenues for both Ethereum and its L2s. At the start of 2024, Ethereum collected ~$6M; in August, that figure was $1.2M. The pie has shrunk at the behest of Ethereum, lowering its blockspace pricing, and because of Layer-2s. Ethereum's share of that pie has also diminished. Compared to 180 days ago, the 7 Day Moving Average of Ethereum's fees is down (-89%)! By comparison, Bitcoin's fees have sagged (-13%) while Tron's and Solana's are up (+125%) and (+114%). This lack of fee generation has bled into Ethereum, becoming an inflationary economic system, with inflation now sitting at 0.74% and 944K of yearly issuance worth $2.45B in new supply.

New Tokens and Competitors: Ethereum's Growing Challenges

At the same time, many tokens have been launched that currently, or in the future, cleave value from Ethereum's ecosystem. These include L2, Data availability, re-staking, and staking tokens. Each of these product groups offers a competing service to Ethereum. Influential investors holding billions of dollars worth of tokens will demand that these projects cut into Ethereum's core businesses. Many of these projects have yet to launch a token, but we can estimate the value they have subtracted from Ethereum by looking at the collective FDV of their tokens. The twelve who have launched or have pre-markets for their tokens' values have captured roughly 11% of Ethereum's ecosystem value. As more projects launch tokens, there will be further competition in Ethereum's service set, driving the price of Ethereum's core services lower while offering competing investment opportunities. This pricing pressure may shrink the economic pie available to ETH holders while increasing competition for investor interest.

ETH's Share of Ethereum Ecosystem Services Token Value Has Decreased from 97% to 89% since Jan 2023

Among Ethereum L2s, Polygon and Optimism stood out this month for significant increases in developer activity, with their contracts per deployer 30-day moving averages up ~7.9x and ~4.8x, respectively. However, MATIC & OP tokens performed in the middle of the pack, down (-15%) and (-14 %), respectively. Polygon PoS developers are likely busy deploying contracts in preparation for the PIP-19 component of the broader Polygon 2.0 rollout, scheduled for September 4th. This upgrade will transition Polygon's native MATIC token to the ecosystem's next-generation POL token, which is designed to accommodate an array of ZK-based L2 chains with community staking and governance. POL is optimized for the development of the aggregated Polygon network (""AggLayer""). This network aims to be a unique scaling solution, moving beyond the current binary competition between modular and monolithic blockchain thesis dominated by Ethereum and Solana.

Polygon & Optimism Dev Outputs Surge Ahead of Upgrades

Optimism developers increased their output this month due to two main catalysts: addressing recently discovered fraud proof vulnerabilities and preparing for interoperability upgrades ahead of OP Labs' Superchain upgrade in early 2025. The Granite Network Upgrade proposal, made in response to third-party audits identifying security issues in Optimism's fault proof, includes both security and performance enhancements. The proposal passed on August 28th and is scheduled for execution on September 10th.

More proactively, Optimism announced its 'Superchain' roadmap this month, a three-milestone plan to bring interoperability to the OP Stack. According to L2Beat, nine of the top 20 Ethereum L2s are built using Optimism's OP Stack codebase. If successful, this roadmap could significantly reduce the liquidity and user fragmentation currently affecting the Ethereum L2 ecosystem. Bringing interoperability to the OP Stack could elevate its user experience to be comparable with high-performance L1s like Solana while retaining the security, applications, and user base of the Ethereum ecosystem. Adding to the Superchain's gravity, Sony Group announced the development of its own Ethereum L2, 'Soneium' that will be built using the OP Stack for both general Sony Group ecosystem applications. Additionally, Soneium will allow the exploration of new purposes, including ""...the protection of rights to creativity created by creators, new mechanisms for returning profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds."" Notably, the Japanese Prime Minister will speak at a Web3 Event in Tokyo later this year.

Arbitrum's native ARB token underperformed this month, down (-23%), with the L2 blockchain showing no meaningful increase in average developer output or total developer count. Earlier in the month, Arbitrum's DAO proposed and approved the development of an ARB staking mechanism, which plans to stream DAO-generated rewards from the L2's sequencer along with MEV, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification rewards to eligible token holders who are delegated to active governance participants.

Alongside Uniswap's UNI token, ARB was also added to the custodial business of the controversial Special Purpose Broker-Dealer, Prometheus Capital. Contrary to more nuanced takes from many crypto industry participants, Prometheum is aligned with the SEC's stance that traditional securities laws provide clear guidance on digital assets transactions. Given Uniswap's embattlement with the SEC, one could view ARB's addition to Prometheum as a bullish catalyst in terms of institutional distribution and liquidity or as a bearish catalyst in terms of exposure to the SEC. In either case, ARB appeared to lag other L2s in organic growth this month.

Base Has ~10x More Contract Deployers Than Other Top L2s

Coinbase's Base blockchain is the largest Ethereum L2 by daily active addresses. Base also boasts a substantial number of smart contract deployers. Data from Artemis.xyz shows that Base has nearly an order of magnitude more addresses deploying smart contracts on its L2 than Arbitrum, Blast, OP Mainnet, or Polygon PoS combined. Like other entrepreneurs, crypto developers must strategically anticipate where their customers will be. We think developers they are increasingly choosing to build on Coinbase's Base because it enjoys a key competitive moat: a direct-to-consumer onramp from its dominant centralized exchange.

In an increasingly fragmented L2 landscape, Coinbase's unique nexus of onchain and offchain users, developers, and liquidity offers compelling virtual real estate for building a crypto business. As Base is also part of the OP Stack, it participates in the Superchain's revenue sharing model. According to the 'Superchain Health Dashboard', Base contributed an estimated 142.45 ETH (~$367k) month-to-date to the Superchain Collective as of August 29th, second only to OP Mainnet itself. Base and Optimism thus present an interesting synergy, with Optimism potentially playing the long-term role of a relatively decentralized modular scaling solution counterpart to Coinbase's more centralized, retail-centric strategy.

August's Notable Performer - Tron (+20%)

Tron's Stablecoin Market Cap Outpaces Other Leading L1s

Up (+20%), Tron's native TRX token stood out once again this month, reaching levels not seen since April 2021. The blockchain's significant performance may largely be attributed to the mid-August launch of the Sun Pump platform Beta - a platform modeled after Solana's infamous pump.fun and named after Tron's founder Justin Sun. Sun Pump is a streamlined tool to launch meme coins in seconds. As of August 28th, Sun Pump has already launched over 56,000 meme coins on Tron, generating over 23 million TRX in revenue for an estimated $3.64 million USD. Effective August 25th, Tron executed Proposal #92 to increase the blockchain's energy cap, lowering gas fees and increasing transaction throughput in response to the increased user activity.

Sun Pump's initial success marks a significant diversification in Tron's adoption drivers, which historically have been centered around stablecoin investments and transfers in the APAC region and emerging economies. Data from Artemis, visualized in the chart above, illustrates the disproportionate amount of stablecoin value issued to the Tron blockchain relative to other leading smart contract blockchains. Indeed, while other blockchains experienced sizable drawdowns in stablecoin market caps during the bear market, Tron's blockchain demonstrated more sustained USD stablecoin retention and growth, even surpassing Ethereum as the blockchain with the most circulating Tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market cap.

However, Tron was not without headwinds or controversy this month. After the Tron DAO Reserve removed ~$732 million of Bitcoin backing the USDD stablecoin (purportedly without community vote), Justin Sun tweeted to assuage concerns, stating, ""The TRON DAO Reserve plans to spend time upgrading USDD in the future to make it a more competitive decentralized stablecoin in the market"", after lamenting that ""...the capital utilization [of USDD's reserves] is not very efficient.""

We maintain a positive view of Tron's retail market penetration as a stablecoin-centric network. However, we hold a highly cautious view of the ecosystem's exposure to Justin Sun's control, given his questionable past actions with USDD and other projects. Bluechip, a third-party stablecoin ratings agency, estimated that USDD's 53% collateralization was comprised of 69% TRX, 29% BTC, and 2% TUSD -- before the latest BTC withdrawal. USDD was initially inspired to compete with the now-collapsed UST stablecoin involved in Terra/LUNA, and we fear it risks suffering a similar fate due to its reliance on TRX for collateral. We are also concerned about the general challenges facing USDT holders who want to off-ramp their tokens to fiat. USDT can be redeemed for dollars by only a few entities, and many holders are supposed have to swap for USDC to offramp their USDT. Additionally, moving USDT from Tron to Ethereum is nearly impossible, adding to our concern of collusion between Sun and Tether to block exits for Tron's USDT holders.

August's Notable Laggard - zkSync (-24.05%)

zkSync User Growth Lags Base, Arbitrum, and Others as Ethereum L2 Ecosystem Activity Bounces

zkSync's native ZK token experienced a significant decline of (-24%) this month, driven partly by its underperforming user growth compared to other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. As the chart above illustrates, the growth of zkSync's daily active addresses -- a proxy for users -- lags that of Base, Arbitrum, and other leading L2s, even as overall activity in the Ethereum L2 ecosystem rebounds. Absent a clear negative catalyst. However, zkSync's stagnation can primarily be attributed to the vacuum left by the absence of its previous driver: airdrop farming.

Previously, zkSync fueled speculation about a potential airdrop, prompting users to interact with its network to increase their potential eligibility. For instance, a September 2023 zkSync blog post mentioned plans to ""fully decentralize the protocol's technology, community governance...,"" and emphasized ""empowering the community with ownership."" On June 11th, zkSync finally revealed details about the airdrop of its native ZK token. However, the distribution was criticized for lacking sybil resistance, a vulnerability in which a single entity can use multiple accounts to gain disproportionate amounts of airdropped tokens. After ZK token claims began the following week, one user claimed to have received over 6.6 million tokens across 350 Sybil wallets, valued at nearly $1.2 million. Simultaneously, many good-faith users found themselves ineligible for the airdrop, rubbing salt in the wounds of loyal community members and highlighting the inefficacy of zkSync's approach to ""fair"" ZK token distributions.

The combined effects of the resulting negative sentiment, lack of ongoing user incentives, and 83% overhanging ZK supply contribute to selling pressure. Moreover, the Ethereum L2 competitive landscape remains fierce, with L2s like Base gaining traction with the development of features like on-chain verification-enabled applications. It is logical that growth driven by organic demand for on-chain applications and more direct-to-consumer distribution such as Coinbase's is more sustainable than the airdrop hype that may have driven much of zkSync's initial growth.

Cryptocurrency Development: Creating and Managing Digital Currencies,https://techbullion.com/cryptocurrency-development-creating-and-managing-digital-currencies/,2024-09-03,TechBullion,"The world of finance is fast changing. One of the most significant developments in recent years is the rise of cryptocurrency. This digital form of money has revolutionized the way people think about and use currency. The creation and management of digital currencies involve complex processes, but they offer tremendous opportunities for both individuals and businesses.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, often based on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This decentralized structure makes cryptocurrencies resistant to censorship and fraud.

Bitcoin, created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been developed, each with unique features and use cases. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.

Cryptocurrencies are often seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems. They offer greater transparency, lower transaction costs, and faster transfer times compared to conventional banking methods. However, they also come with risks, including volatility and regulatory uncertainty.

The Process of Creating a Cryptocurrency

Creating a cryptocurrency is a multi-step process that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography. Below are the key steps involved in developing a digital currency:

Define the Purpose of the Cryptocurrency

Before creating a cryptocurrency, it's essential to define its purpose. What problem does it solve? What is its target audience? For example, Bitcoin was created as a decentralized alternative to traditional currency. Ethereum, on the other hand, was developed to enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Defining the purpose of the cryptocurrency will guide its development and help differentiate it from the thousands of other digital currencies in the market.

Choose a Consensus Algorithm

A consensus algorithm is a process used by blockchain networks to validate transactions and ensure the integrity of the ledger. There are several types of consensus algorithms, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The most common algorithms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). PoW, used by Bitcoin, requires participants to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. PoS, used by Ethereum, allows participants to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold. The choice of consensus algorithm will impact the security, speed, and energy efficiency of the cryptocurrency.

Design the Blockchain Architecture

The blockchain architecture determines how the cryptocurrency will function. This includes deciding whether to use an existing blockchain platform, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, or to create a new one from scratch. Using an existing platform can save time and resources, but it may limit customization options. On the other hand, building a new blockchain allows for greater flexibility but requires significant technical expertise and resources.

Develop the Cryptocurrency Code

Once the blockchain architecture is in place, the next step is to develop the cryptocurrency code. This involves writing the code that will govern the creation, distribution, and management of the cryptocurrency. This code is typically written in programming languages such as C++, Python, or Solidity. It is crucial to ensure that the code is secure and free from vulnerabilities, as any weaknesses could be exploited by hackers.

Create the Cryptocurrency Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that allows users to store, send, and receive digital currencies. There are different types of wallets, including desktop wallets, mobile wallets, and hardware wallets. When developing a cryptocurrency, it's essential to create a wallet that is user-friendly and secure. The wallet should also support multiple platforms to ensure accessibility for a wide range of users.

Launch the Cryptocurrency

After the cryptocurrency code and wallet have been developed, the next step is to launch the cryptocurrency. This involves deploying the blockchain network, distributing the initial supply of coins or tokens, and making the cryptocurrency available for trading on exchanges. It's also important to create a marketing strategy to promote the cryptocurrency and attract users.

Maintain and Update the Cryptocurrency

Launching a cryptocurrency is just the beginning. To ensure its long-term success, it's essential to maintain and update the cryptocurrency regularly. This includes fixing bugs, implementing new features, and addressing security vulnerabilities. It's also important to engage with the community and gather feedback to improve the cryptocurrency over time.

Managing Digital Currencies

Once a cryptocurrency has been created, managing it effectively is crucial to its success. Managing digital currencies involves overseeing their distribution, ensuring their security, and promoting their adoption. Below are some key aspects of managing digital currencies:

Security

Security is one of the most critical aspects of managing digital currencies. Given the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, they are often targeted by hackers. To protect digital currencies from theft and fraud, it's essential to implement robust security measures. This includes using encryption, multi-signature wallets, and cold storage solutions to safeguard funds. Regular security audits and updates are also necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Regulation

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies widely from country to country. In some jurisdictions, cryptocurrencies are fully legal and regulated, while in others, they are banned or restricted. Managing digital currencies requires staying informed about the latest regulatory developments and ensuring compliance with local laws. This may involve registering the cryptocurrency with regulatory authorities, implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, and paying taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.

Adoption and Use

For a cryptocurrency to succeed, it must be widely adopted and used. This involves promoting the cryptocurrency to potential users, businesses, and investors. One way to increase adoption is to create partnerships with businesses that accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment. It's also important to make the cryptocurrency easy to use by developing user-friendly wallets and payment systems. Encouraging the development of dApps and other use cases for the cryptocurrency can also help drive adoption.

Community Engagement

Building a strong community is essential for the long-term success of a cryptocurrency. Engaging with the community through social media, forums, and events can help build trust and loyalty among users. It's also important to listen to feedback from the community and address any concerns or issues that arise. A strong and active community can help promote the cryptocurrency and drive its adoption.

Market Dynamics

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, with prices often fluctuating dramatically. Managing digital currencies requires staying informed about market trends and making strategic decisions to protect the value of the cryptocurrency. This may involve adjusting the supply of the cryptocurrency, implementing price stabilization mechanisms, or engaging in market-making activities. It's also important to monitor the performance of competitors and adapt to changes in the market.

Challenges and Opportunities in Cryptocurrency Development

Cryptocurrency development presents both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, creating and managing a digital currency requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography. It also involves navigating complex regulatory environments and managing security risks. On the other hand, the potential rewards are significant. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, create new business models, and empower individuals and communities.

One of the biggest challenges in cryptocurrency development is scalability. As the number of users and transactions on a blockchain network increases, so does the strain on the network's resources. This can lead to slower transaction times and higher fees. To address this challenge, developers are exploring solutions such as sharding, layer-2 scaling, and new consensus algorithms.

Another challenge is regulatory uncertainty. The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies widely from country to country, and regulations are constantly evolving. This creates uncertainty for developers and users, making it difficult to plan for the future. However, regulatory clarity is gradually improving, with more governments recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities in cryptocurrency development are vast. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more. They can enable faster and cheaper cross-border payments, increase financial inclusion, and create new opportunities for innovation.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrency development is a complex but rewarding endeavor. It involves creating a digital currency from scratch, managing its security, promoting its adoption, and navigating regulatory challenges. While the road to success is not without obstacles, the potential rewards are significant. As the world becomes increasingly digital, cryptocurrencies will play an essential role in shaping the future of finance and beyond.

For those interested in exploring this exciting field, understanding the fundamentals of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography is crucial. By staying informed about the latest developments and trends in the cryptocurrency space, developers and entrepreneurs can seize the opportunities presented by this rapidly evolving industry.

Binance Web3 Wallet offers a range of features designed to enhance the user experience and provide advanced asset management capabilities:

Security is a central focus of the Binance Web3 Wallet. By using advanced MPC technology, the wallet secures users' assets without needing a seed phrase, which is typically a vulnerable point in other wallets.

Instead, the wallet divides the private key into three ""key-shares,"" each protected by a recovery password and stored in separate locations -- on the user's device, in cloud storage, and within the Web3 Wallet. This method significantly mitigates the risk associated with centralized storage of private keys and enhances overall security.

Wasabi Wallet is an open-source, non-custodial Bitcoin wallet designed for desktop use, with a strong emphasis on privacy and security.

As a software solution that runs directly on your computer, Wasabi Wallet empowers users to manage their bitcoins while prioritizing the confidentiality of their transactions.

Wasabi Wallet is packed with features aimed at enhancing user privacy and security. Here are some of the most notable:

The wallet is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify it. Besides transparency, the wallet also puts a special focus on anonymity; the CoinJoin coordinator used by Wasabi cannot access or compromise the privacy of the participants. This ensures that the mixing process remains secure and anonymous.

Moreover, Wasabi Wallet implements hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, avoids address reuse, and mandates coin labeling, all contributing to maintaining user privacy and security.

Currently, Wasabi Wallet supports only Bitcoin, reflecting its focus on providing a specialized, privacy-centric tool for Bitcoin users.

While they're suitable for those who frequently work with their laptops and PCs and need to manage their crypto assets on-site, it's fair to lay out some of the advantages and disadvantages of desktop wallets. Here are some pros explained:

Now, let's go with the bad:

With various options available, it's important to consider several factors to ensure the wallet you choose meets your security, compatibility, and usability needs.

A fundamental aspect of any crypto wallet is control over private keys. Choosing a wallet that allows you to manage your private keys directly is vital. This ensures that you, not a third party, have complete control over your funds, providing an additional layer of security.

For enhanced security, look for wallets that support two-factor authentication (2FA). This feature requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device, before granting access to your wallet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Similarly, check the wallet's encryption standards and key storage methods. Strong encryption protocols and secure key storage are critical in protecting your wallet from potential breaches and unauthorized access. A wallet with robust backup options ensures that you can easily regain access to your digital assets, minimizing the risk of permanently losing your funds.

It might be obvious, but make sure your wallet is compatible with your device and operating system, whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Moreover, make sure your wallet supports hardware integration if you're looking for extra compatibility and usability with other devices. There are certain additional features to keep an eye on. For example, some desktop wallets offer built-in conversion features, enabling users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. This allows you to rebalance your portfolio without transferring funds to an external exchange.

Also, make sure the wallet you choose supports the cryptocurrency you plan to use. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to download it.

Choose a wallet that is actively developed and regularly updated with the latest technological advancements and security patches. Moreover, check for customer support services and make sure it is at least decent enough to guide you through basic questions.

Again, desktop wallets are not a replacement for hardware wallets, which are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency over the long term. Desktop wallets, however, are suitable for holding smaller amounts that you need to access more frequently.

Cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms and colors, each offering distinct advantages and features tailored to different user needs. Hot wallets and cold storage are two popular methods of storing digital assets today.

Let's begin with hot wallets.

Hot wallets are software applications designed to manage and transact cryptocurrencies. These wallets are always connected to the internet and are available on various platforms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop, of course. What makes these applications popular is their ease of use and accessibility, making them a common choice for daily transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Web Wallets: Typically installed as browser extensions on popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. They allow you to manage, store, and transact cryptocurrencies directly through web browsers. They often support dApps, Web3 applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Mobile Wallets: Designed for iOS and Android devices, mobile wallets offer the convenience of managing digital assets on the go. However, be careful of exposing your phone to malware, and beware that there's always the chance you may lose the device.

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. Their offline status greatly reduces the risk of hacking and other online threats.

Cold wallets, another term for it, are especially suited for those looking to store crypto for the long run and seek a device with a level of security. Here are some of the key features of cold wallets:

A desktop wallet for cryptocurrencies is a software tool designed to be installed on a user's computer, enabling them to store, manage, and transfer digital currencies securely.

One of the key features of these wallets is that they grant users direct control over their private keys, ensuring that they maintain full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

Typically, desktop wallets are designed to maximize security by being used on a single device. But some wallets offer features that allow users to sync their wallet data between devices, often through cloud storage or other methods. It's essential to review the specific features of the wallet you are considering to understand its capabilities regarding multi-device access.

If you lose access to your desktop wallet or the stored device, you can restore it using a recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. This phrase is a critical backup that allows you to regain access to your digital assets. Make sure you save your recovery phrase securely and never share it with anyone, as it is the key to restoring your wallet.

Desktop wallets have become popular among crypto enthusiasts because they provide a secure environment for managing various cryptocurrencies. This guide on the best desktop crypto wallets highlights some of the top options in the market today.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_desktop_wallets_cover.jpg,0.1529411764705881

Discover how these digital assets are poised to influence the global financial ecosystem and what the future might hold for them in different parts of the world.

Definition of Altcoins and Their Distinction from Bitcoin

Altcoins (short for 'alternative coins') refer to any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most widely recognised and valued, altcoins have emerged as alternatives with different purposes, functionalities, and technologies. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange, altcoins often aim to improve upon Bitcoin's limitations or offer entirely new features. For instance, Ethereum, the most prominent altcoin, introduced smart contracts that allow for decentralised applications, while others, like Litecoin, focus on faster transaction speeds.

Overview of the Current Altcoin Market

The market for altcoins has grown exponentially since the early days of cryptocurrency. Today, there are thousands of altcoins, each with unique use cases and technological innovations. The market capitalisation of altcoins has increased significantly, accounting for a substantial portion of the overall cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, the combined market cap of altcoins has been steadily rising, driven by the increasing adoption of decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain-based solutions across various industries. However, the altcoin market remains highly volatile, influenced by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment.

Importance of Altcoins for Global and Local Economies

Altcoins play a crucial role in both global and local economies. On a global scale, they contribute to the diversification of the cryptocurrency market, offering investors and users a broader range of options beyond Bitcoin. Altcoins have also been at the forefront of technological innovation, driving the development of decentralised applications, smart contracts, and blockchain solutions that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries. Locally, altcoins can empower emerging markets by providing access to financial services, enabling cross-border transactions, and fostering economic inclusion. In countries with unstable currencies or limited access to banking, altcoins can offer alternative financial systems, thus enhancing economic resilience and promoting growth.

Altcoins by Region

1.1. Americas

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum, developed in the United States, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and the most significant altcoin in terms of impact and innovation. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just a digital currency, it is a decentralised platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). Its introduction of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with Ethereum 2.0 have solidified its position as a leading technology in the blockchain space. The prospects for Ethereum are promising, especially as the demand for decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to grow.

Solana (SOL)

Solana is another prominent altcoin originating from the Americas, particularly from the United States. It is known for its high-performance blockchain, which supports thousands of transactions per second at low costs. Solana's innovative proof-of-history consensus mechanism sets it apart, making it a strong contender in the race to scale blockchain technology. As more developers and projects migrate to Solana due to its speed and efficiency, its potential for growth in the coming years is substantial.

1.2. Europe

Cardano (ADA)

Cardano, developed by a team of engineers and academics in Europe, is a blockchain platform designed for sustainability, scalability, and interoperability. Unlike many other altcoins, Cardano's development is based on peer-reviewed research and a formal development model. Cardano aims to create a more secure and scalable blockchain network, particularly for decentralised finance applications. With its unique Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and focus on real-world applications, Cardano has the potential to play a significant role in the future of blockchain technology in Europe and beyond.

IOTA (MIOTA)

IOTA, another significant European altcoin, is designed to facilitate transactions between devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Unlike traditional blockchains, IOTA uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure called the Tangle, which allows for feeless transactions and infinite scalability. Supported by the European Union, IOTA is being integrated into various smart city projects and industrial applications across the continent. The growth of IoT and smart infrastructure in Europe bodes well for IOTA's future adoption and success.

1.3. Asia

Binance Coin (BNB)

Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the most prominent altcoins in Asia, originating from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which was initially founded in China before relocating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. BNB was initially created as a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, but its use has expanded significantly. BNB is now integral to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralised applications. BSC has gained popularity due to its low transaction fees and faster processing times compared to Ethereum, making BNB a central player in the Asian and global crypto markets. The widespread adoption of Binance's ecosystem across Asia positions BNB as a key altcoin with strong growth potential.

NEO

Often referred to as the 'Chinese Ethereum', NEO is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency enabling digital assets and smart contracts development. NEO was developed in China and is designed to digitise various assets using smart contracts, focusing on regulatory compliance and a digital identity system. NEO's dual-token system, featuring NEO and GAS tokens, allows for the smooth operation of the network and provides incentives for developers and users. Despite strict cryptocurrency regulations in China, NEO has managed to maintain relevance, especially in projects that require a combination of blockchain technology and regulatory oversight. With China's growing interest in adopting blockchain technology for its digital economy, NEO is well-positioned to play a significant role in the region's blockchain development.

Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is an Indian-origin blockchain platform that addresses some of Ethereum's major scalability issues. By providing a Layer 2 scaling solution, Polygon enhances transaction speed and reduces fees on the Ethereum network. With the growing interest in decentralised finance and the increasing number of dApps being built on the Ethereum platform, Polygon's importance and adoption are likely to grow. Its strong foundation in India, a country with a burgeoning tech industry, positions Polygon as a critical player in the global altcoin market.

Vexanium (VEX)

Vexanium is a blockchain platform from Indonesia designed to support decentralised applications (dApps) and digital marketing solutions. It aims to provide an accessible blockchain platform for businesses and developers in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. Vexanium's focus on local businesses and its adaptability to regional markets give it a unique edge in the Asian altcoin landscape. As blockchain adoption increases in Southeast Asia, Vexanium has the potential to grow significantly within this emerging market.

2.1. Technological Innovations

Impact of DeFi and NFTs on Altcoin Development

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have been among the most significant drivers of technological innovation in the altcoin space. DeFi platforms allow users to access financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries, using smart contracts on blockchain networks. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon have become central to the DeFi ecosystem due to their ability to support these decentralized applications (dApps). The growth of DeFi has also led to the creation of numerous specialized altcoins that cater specifically to this market, offering unique features and governance models.

Similarly, NFTs have opened new avenues for digital ownership and creativity, with altcoins like Ethereum and Binance Coin playing crucial roles in the minting and trading of NFTs. The rise of NFTs has also sparked the development of new blockchain networks optimized for these tokens, further diversifying the altcoin market. As DeFi and NFT adoption continue to expand, altcoins that support or innovate within these sectors are likely to see increased demand and development.

Advancement of Smart Contracts and Network Scalability

Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, have revolutionized the way transactions and agreements are handled on blockchain networks. Ethereum pioneered this technology, but many other altcoins have since built upon and improved it. For example, Cardano's use of a formal development model and peer-reviewed research in the implementation of smart contracts aims to enhance security and scalability.

Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges for blockchain networks, and various altcoins are addressing this in different ways. Solana's proof-of-history consensus mechanism allows it to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains available. Similarly, Polygon's Layer 2 solution helps alleviate congestion on the Ethereum network by handling transactions off-chain, significantly reducing fees and improving transaction speed. These innovations in smart contracts and scalability are critical for the continued growth and adoption of altcoins.

2.2. Regulatory Issues

Variations in Cryptocurrency Regulations Across Countries

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies significantly from one country to another, impacting the development and adoption of altcoins. In the United States, regulatory bodies like the SEC have been scrutinising cryptocurrencies with a focus on ensuring compliance with securities laws. While this regulatory uncertainty can create challenges for altcoins operating within the U.S., it also pushes developers to create more robust and compliant systems.

In Europe, regulations are generally more liberal, with the European Union working on frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation to provide clarity and support for the growth of digital assets. Altcoins in Europe, such as IOTA and Cardano, benefit from this relatively favourable regulatory environment, which encourages innovation while protecting investors.

Asia presents a mixed regulatory landscape. Some countries, like China, have imposed strict regulations, including outright bans on cryptocurrency trading, which pose challenges for NEO and other Chinese altcoins. However, other countries in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, have adopted more crypto-friendly regulations, allowing for the development and growth of local altcoins. India's regulatory stance is rapidly evolving via ongoing discussions about regulating cryptocurrencies, which will significantly impact the future of Indian altcoins like Polygon.

Impact of Regulations on Altcoin Development and Adoption

Regulations play a pivotal role in adopting and developing altcoins. Strict regulations can hinder the growth of altcoins by limiting their accessibility and use cases. Conversely, clear and supportive regulations can foster innovation and encourage the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. For instance, the positive regulatory environment in countries like Switzerland has made it a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation, attracting projects from around the world.

In contrast, ambiguous or hostile regulations can stifle innovation and drive projects to relocate to more favourable jurisdictions. The regulatory environment also affects investor confidence, with clear regulations providing a sense of security and encouraging institutional investment in altcoins. As global regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the adaptability of altcoins to these changes will be crucial to their long-term success.

2.3. Economic Factors

Impact of Economic Unrest on Altcoins' Appeal

Economic instability, such as inflation, currency devaluation, and financial crises, often drives interest in cryptocurrencies, including altcoins. In countries experiencing hyperinflation or a lack of trust in the local currency, citizens may turn to altcoins as a store of value or a means of conducting transactions. For example, in Venezuela, where inflation has reached extreme levels, altcoins like Dash have gained popularity as alternatives to the national currency.

Similarly, in countries with unstable political or economic environments, altcoins can provide a hedge against local economic conditions. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies allows users to bypass traditional financial systems, offering a level of financial autonomy that is particularly appealing in times of economic uncertainty.

Role of Altcoins in the Development of Digital Economies

Altcoins are increasingly playing a crucial role in developing digital economies, particularly in emerging markets. By offering alternatives to traditional financial systems, altcoins can foster financial inclusion, especially in regions with limited access to banking services. Altcoins also enable the creation of new economic models, such as token economies, where users can earn, trade, and spend tokens within specific ecosystems.

According to Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa Broker, 'As digital economies continue to expand, the role of altcoins in these ecosystems is likely to increase, offering new opportunities for economic growth and innovation.'

Before diving into the world of crypto dice casino sites, it's important to grasp the basics of cryptocurrency. Simply put, cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for secure financial transactions.

Unlike traditional currency, it operates independently of a central bank and is decentralized. This offers benefits such as low transaction fees and faster processing times.

The Basics of Cryptocurrency

In order to use cryptocurrency on casino sites, it is essential to understand how it works. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets, which can be either software-based or hardware-based.

Wallets provide the necessary encryption tools to secure transactions and store cryptocurrency securely. Popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, offer different features and levels of security.

By familiarizing yourself with the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, you'll be better equipped to make informed decisions when using it on casino sites.

The Rise of Crypto Dice Casino Sites

What exactly are crypto dice casino sites, and why are they gaining popularity?

Crypto dice casinos are online gambling platforms that solely accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

These innovative sites offer dice games that provide players with a simple yet thrilling way to test their luck. The gameplay is straightforward - players place bets on the outcome of a dice roll or other dice games, with the chance to win attractive prizes. The rise of crypto dice casino sites can be attributed to several factors.

What are Crypto Dice Casino Sites?

Crypto dice casino sites are unique platforms that cater specifically to cryptocurrency users. These sites offer a wide range of dice games that utilize sophisticated algorithms to ensure fairness.

With their enticing rewards and the excitement of rolling the dice, these sites have become a popular choice for crypto enthusiasts looking for a thrilling gambling experience.

Why Crypto Dice Casino Sites are Gaining Popularity

The popularity of crypto dice casino sites can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency transactions appeals to those who value privacy and want to keep their gambling activities discreet.

Secondly, the use of blockchain technology ensures provably fair gameplay, enhancing the trustworthiness of these platforms.

Finally, the rising interest in cryptocurrency as an investment has led to an increased demand for crypto dice casino sites, providing a unique and potentially lucrative opportunity for investors and gamblers alike.

Another reason for the growing popularity of crypto dice casino sites is the global accessibility they offer.

Traditional casinos often have geographical restrictions, limiting access to players in certain countries. However, with crypto dice casinos, players from around the world can participate in the excitement of dice games without any limitations.

This level of inclusivity has attracted a diverse and international community of players, further fueling the popularity of these sites.

How to Choose the Right Crypto Dice Casino Site

Evaluating the Credibility of the Site

Before committing your cryptocurrency to a dice casino site, it's crucial to assess its credibility. Look for licenses and regulatory certifications that guarantee the platform's legitimacy.

Read reviews and feedback from other players to get insights into their experience with the site. A reputable and transparent platform will provide peace of mind and ensure fair gameplay.

It's beneficial to check if the crypto dice casino site employs provably fair technology. This technology allows players to verify the fairness of each game's outcome, ensuring that the results are not manipulated.

By choosing a platform that utilizes provably fair systems, you can trust that your gaming experience is free from any form of cheating or bias.

Assessing the Variety of Games and Betting Options

Another important aspect to consider is the variety of games and betting options available on the crypto dice casino site.

Ensure that the site offers a wide range of dice games to suit your preferences and provides flexible betting options to accommodate different budgets. A diverse selection of games will keep you entertained and engaged for longer periods.

Look for additional features such as tournaments, challenges, or interactive chat rooms that can enhance your overall gaming experience.

Crypto dice games are online gambling games where players bet on the outcome of a dice roll using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. These games typically involve predicting whether the result of a dice roll will be above or below a certain number.

2. How do crypto dice sites ensure fairness?

Most reputable crypto dice sites use a ""provably fair"" system. This cryptographic algorithm allows players to verify each roll's fairness independently. It typically involves a combination of a server seed, a client seed, and a nonce, which together determine the roll's outcome.

The legality of crypto dice sites varies by jurisdiction. In many countries, online gambling laws haven't caught up with cryptocurrency technology. It's crucial to check your local laws before participating. Remember, even if it's legal in your area, you're responsible for reporting any winnings for tax purposes.

5. How do I deposit and withdraw funds?

To deposit, you typically need to send cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the address provided by the dice site. Withdrawals work similarly - you request a withdrawal to your wallet address. Always double-check addresses to avoid losing funds.

6. What's the house edge in crypto dice games?

The house edge varies by platform but is typically between 1% and 2%. Some sites offer even lower house edges as low as 0.5%. Always check the specific odds and house edge for each game before playing.

7. Can I play crypto dice games on mobile devices?

Yes, most modern crypto dice sites are mobile-friendly and can be accessed through your smartphone or tablet's web browser. Some platforms even offer dedicated mobile apps for a smoother experience.

8. What's the difference between automatic and manual betting?

Automatic betting allows you to set parameters (like bet amount, number of bets, and stop conditions) and let the system place bets for you. Manual betting requires you to input your bet for each roll manually. Automatic can be faster but carries risks if not monitored carefully.

9. Are there bonuses or rewards programs on crypto dice sites?

Many sites offer welcome bonuses, deposit matches, cashback programs, or loyalty points. However, always read the terms and conditions carefully, as these often come with wagering requirements or other restrictions.

Bitcoin: A Price History of the First Cryptocurrency (Updated 2024),https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-price-history-first-cryptocurrency-updated-2024,2024-08-09,NASDAQ Stock Market,"Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, paved the way for the cryptocurrency asset class.

Now the cryptocurrency of choice, its meteoric rise was unlike any other commodity, resource or asset. Bitcoin's price rose more than 1,200 percent from March 2020 to reach US$69,044 on November 10, 2021.

The currency showcased its famous volatility in the following year, falling as low as US$15,787 by November 2022 amid economic uncertainty and a wave of negative media coverage.

The cryptocurrency started 2024 just below US$45,000 and has seen substantial gains in the first half of this year. Bitcoin reached its new all-time high price of US$73,115 on March 11, 2024.

So, where did Bitcoin start, and what has spurred Bitcoin's price movements in recent years? Read on to find out.

What was Bitcoin's starting price?

When Bitcoin started trading in 2009, its starting price was a minuscule US$0.0009, making its price movements since then even more impressive.

Created as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, the concept of Bitcoin was first introduced in a nine-page white paper titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" on October 31, 2008, on a platform called Metzdowd.

The manifesto was penned by a notoriously elusive person (or persons) who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The author(s) laid out a compelling argument and groundwork for a new type of cyber-currency that would revolutionize the monetary system.

Cryptographically secured, Bitcoin was designed to be transparent and resistant to censorship, using the power of blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger preventing double-spending. The true allure for Bitcoin's early adopters was in its potential to wrestle power away from banks and financial institutes and give it to the masses.

This was especially enticing as the fallout from the 2008 financial collapse ricocheted internationally. Described as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, US$7.4 billion in value was erased from the US stock market in 11 months, while the global economy shrank by an estimated US$2 trillion.

On January 3, 2009, the Genesis Block was established, marking the beginning of Bitcoin's blockchain, onto which all additional blocks have been added. The Genesis Block contained the first 50 Bitcoins ever created and a simple message: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.""

Many believe the message hints at Bitcoin's mission, as it references an article in The London Times that criticized the British government's inadequate response to the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008, particularly the government's inability to provide effective relief and support to the struggling economy.

On January 12, 2009, Nakamoto sent the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, a computer scientist and early Bitcoin enthusiast. The transaction involved 10 Bitcoins and was a crucial milestone in the cryptocurrency's development and adoption.

News of the cryptocurrency continued to spread around the Internet, but its value did not rise above US$0 until October 12, 2009, when a Finnish software developer sent 5,050 Bitcoins to New Liberty Standard for US$5.02 via PayPal, thereby establishing both the value of Bitcoin and New Liberty Standard as a Bitcoin exchange.

The first time Bitcoin was used to make a purchase was on May 22, 2010, when a programmer in Florida named Laszlo Hanyecz offered anyone who would bring him a pizza 10,000 Bitcoin in exchange. Someone accepted the offer and ordered Hanyecz two Papa John's pizzas for US$25. The 10,000 Bitcoin pizza order essentially set Bitcoin's price in 2010 at around US$0.0025.

Bitcoin's price finally broke through the US$1 mark in 2011, and moved as high as US$29.60 that year. However, it fell back down and remained relatively muted in 2012.

Bitcoin's price saw its first significant growth in earnest in 2013, the year it broke through both US$100 and US$1,000. It climbed all the way to US$1,242 in December 2013.

From that peak, Bitcoin's price began to fall, and it spent most of 2015 in the US$200 range. Its price turned around in December 2015 and began to climb again, and it ended the year at around US$430.

January 1, 2016, marked the beginning of Bitcoin's sustained price rise. It started the year at US$433 and ended it at US$989 -- a 128 percent value increase in 12 months.

That year, several contributing factors led to Bitcoin's rise in mainstream popularity. The stock market experienced one of its worst first weeks ever in 2016, and investors began turning to Bitcoin as a ""safe-haven"" stock amidst economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

2016 also saw the Brexit referendum in the UK in June and the election of Donald Trump to the White House in November, both events that coincided with a bump in Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin continued its ascent, while various industries continued to take an interest in blockchain technology, particularly technology and finance. In February, a group of investors that included IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Goldman Sachs invested US$60 million in a New York firm developing blockchain technology for financial services, Dig Asset Holdings. Bitcoin was trading at US$368.12 on February 2, down a bit from January, but two months later it was US$418.

In May the price of Bitcoin experienced a significant price increase, rising by 21 percent to US$539 at the end of the month. Its price went higher into June, peaking at US$764 on June 18. After that, it fell sharply and spent the summer in the high US$600 range. It dropped to US$517 on August 1 and started its climb all over again.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch partnered for a finance transacting endeavor in September. Not much price movement was observed, but Bitcoin remained on a steady upward trajectory after that. In October, Ripple partnered with 12 banks in a trial that used its native digital currency token XRP to facilitate cross-border payments. Institutional investment bolstered investor confidence, and Bitcoin went from US$629 to US$736 between October 20 and November 20.

Bitcoin's popularity continued into 2017, and it rose from US$1,035.24 in January to US$18,940.57 in December. Futures contracts began trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in December 2017, and Bitcoin began to be more widely perceived as a legitimate investment rather than a passing fad. FOMO flooded the market. What ensued was a frenzy of media coverage featuring celebrity endorsements and initial coin offerings (ICOs) that spilled into 2018.

Regulators began to take notice and issued warnings and guidelines meant to protect investors and mitigate risks associated with digital assets, which only seemed to make people want them more.

Through it all, Bitcoin remained the ""gold standard"" of cryptocurrencies, yet its price was subject to extreme volatility. At the beginning of 2019, it was around US$3,800, it reached nearly US$13,000 in June, but by December 2019 Bitcoin was trading at around US$7,2000.

What factors led to Bitcoin's rise in the early 2020s?

2020 proved a testing ground for the digital coin's ability to weather financial upheaval. Starting the year at US$6,950.56, a widespread selloff in March triggered by the pandemic brought its value to US$4,841.67 -- a 30 percent decline.

The low created a buying opportunity that helped Bitcoin regain its losses by May. The rally continued throughout 2020, and the digital asset ended the year at US$29,402.64, a 323 percent year-over-year increase and a 507 percent rise from its March drop.

By comparison, gold, one of the best-performing commodities of 2020, added 38 percent to its value from the low in March through December, setting what was then an all-time high of US$2,060 per ounce in August.

Bitcoin's ascent continued in 2021, rallying to an all-time high of US$68,649.05 in November, a 98.82 percent increase from January. Much of the growth in 2021 was attributed to risk-on investor appetite.

Increased money printing in response to the pandemic also benefited Bitcoin, as investors with more capital looked to diversify their portfolios. The success of the world's first cryptocurrency amid the market ups and downs of 2020 and 2021 led to more interest and investment in other coins and digital assets as well. For example, 2021 saw the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unique crypto assets that are stored, sold and traded digitally using blockchain technology.

Almost immediately following its record close above US$69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's value began to fall once again. Market uncertainty weighed especially heavily on Bitcoin in 2022. During the second quarter of that year, values dived below US$20,000 for the first time since December 2020.

On May 7, 2022, Curve Whale Watching posted the first sign that confidence in Terra Luna, a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, was waning after 85 million of its stablecoin UST exchanged for less than the 1:1 ratio it was supposed to maintain. This triggered a massive sell-off that brought Luna's value down 99.7 percent and eventually resulted in the Terra tokens ceasing to be traded on major crypto exchanges.

Terra's collapse had a domino effect on the industry as investors' faith in crypto crumbled. In July, the Celsius network, a platform where users could deposit crypto into digital wallets to accrue interest, halted all transfers due to ""extreme market conditions"", driving down the price of Bitcoin even further to US$19,047, a 60 percent decline from January 2022. In July, Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

However, the biggest shake-up to the industry came in November when CoinDesk published findings that cryptocurrency trading firm Alameda Research led by Sam Bankman-Fried had borrowed billions of dollars of customer funds from crypto exchange and sister company FTX. Over a third of Alameda's assets were tied up in FTT, the native cryptocurrency of FTX.

Once this news broke, investors withdrew their funds en masse, causing a liquidity crunch that collapsed FTX. Bankman-Fried was later arrested and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison on counts of money laundering, wire fraud and securities fraud.

Although Bitcoin was never implicated, the fallout of the FTX scandal led to a crisis of confidence across the sector and increased scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement. By the end of 2022, prices for Bitcoin had moved even lower to settle below US$17,000.

What was the highest price for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin set a new all-time high price on March 14, 2024, when it reached US$73,737.94 per BTC. This new highest price came after more than a year of slowly climbing back up from its 2022 lows.

Bitcoin's powerful performance cannot be understated as evidenced by its price performance in the later half of 2023 and so far in 2024.

Concerns with the banking system led the price of Bitcoin to rally in March 2023 to US$28,211 by March 21 after the failure of multiple US banks alarmed investors.

In Q2 2023, Bitcoin continued its ascent, stabilizing above US$25,000 even as the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), along with Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao.

Although it looked like bad news for the sector, Bitcoin stayed steady, holding above US$25,000. This was supported by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund with the SEC on June 15.

Bitcoin's price jumped above US$30,000 on June 21, and on July 3, the crypto hit its highest price since May 2022 at US$31,500. It held above US$30,000 for nearly a month before dropping just below on July 16. By September 11, prices had slid further to US$25,150.

Heading into the final months of the year, the Bitcoin price benefited from increased institutional investment on the prospect of the SEC approving a bevy of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by early 2024. In mid-November the price for the popular cryptocurrency was trading up at US$37,885, and by the end of the year that figure had risen further to US$42,228 per BTC.

Once the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs hit the wires, the price per coin jumped again to US$46,620 on January 10, 2024. These investment vehicles were a major driving force behind the more than 42 percent rise in value for Bitcoin in February; it reached US$61,113 on the last day of the month.

On March 4, Bitcoin surged almost 8 percent in 24 hours to trade at US$67,758, less than 2 percent away from its previous record, and on March 11 it hit a new milestone, surpassing the US$72,000 mark. Three days later, on March 14, Bitcoin reached its highest-ever recorded price of US$73,737.94, surpassing the market cap of silver.

How did the 2024 Bitcoin halving affect its price?

Bitcoin often surges leading up to the halving events, which is when Bitcoin rewards are halved for miners. The most recent came in April when the reward for completing a block was cut from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin.

Bitcoin often surges leading up to the halving, and several sources cited the 2024 halving as one of the forces that drove the price of Bitcoin to its newest high; however, with only three halvings in history, it's difficult to assertively identify price trends.

The halving occurred at around 8:10 p.m. EDT on a Friday, and Bitcoin's price remained stable within the US$63,000 to US$65,000 range over the ensuing weekend. On April 22, the Monday following the halving, it was slightly above US$66,000.

While Bitcoin's price stayed relatively stable, the cryptocurrency's trading volume experienced significant fluctuations through that weekend, with a 45 percent increase from April 19 to April 20 followed by a 68 percent decline on April 21. Between April 30 and May 3, it fell as low as US$56,903 following the Federal Reserve's April policy meeting, which did not produce a rate cut.

Reports that the SEC was moving to approve spot Ether ETFs in May sent the price of Bitcoin climbing again alongside that of Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which serves as the foundation for these ETFs. Bitcoin passed US$71,000 for the second time ever at 8:00 p.m. EDT on May 20, days before the SEC approved spot Ether ETFs on May 23.

Bitcoin hovered between US$67,000 and US$69,000 for the remainder of the month and into the middle of June. It fell back below US$67,000 on June 13 and moved lower the next day when the Federal Reserve opted to delay lowering interest rates once again.

Losses picked up speed through late June and continued in July, with analysts pointing to uncertainty over post-election regulations, Germany's sell-off of seized Bitcoin assets and concerns about the impact of the defunct trading platform Mt. Gox on the token market. Bitcoin dropped to a two-month low of US$55,880 on July 8, but quickly recovered most of its losses after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony on July 9 that signaled rate cuts may not be far off.

As crypto gains wider acceptance and accessibility, with more traditional financial institutions and products incorporating digital assets, the type of risk that Bitcoin represents has evolved. Bitcoin was primarily seen as a highly speculative alternative investment. Now, with expanding institutional interest, it is increasingly seen as a ""risk-on"" asset - meaning its price movements are influenced by market sentiment, investor confidence and broader economic conditions.

A rise in Bitcoin's price ensued after the July 13 assassination attempt of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has been actively endorsing the crypto industry for support. Bitcoin rose from US$57,899 to US$66,690 in the week following the incident as the odds of a Trump victory were seen to improve, highlighting the impact of regulatory uncertainty on the market. However, Bitcoin's price didn't experience any significant pullbacks in the week after current US President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and current Vice President Kamala Harris took over as the new nominee.

Other significant developments affecting Bitcoin during recent weeks include the underwhelming performance of spot Ether ETFs, fears of a US government Bitcoin sell-off, Trump's proposed national Bitcoin stockpile and Trump's declining chances of winning the election as support for Harris snowballs. The biggest driver of price volatility came in early August when an economic scare triggered a significant sell-off event across many global markets and cryptocurrencies.

What is Bitcoin at today?

As of 4:00 p.m. EDT on August 8, Bitcoin was valued at US$59,490, having partially recovered from the deep losses it incurred in early August.

The price of Bitcoin fell alongside digital assets and the broader stock market on August 5 in a sell-off event triggered by a series of events including weaker-than-expected economic data the prior Thursday (August 2). An unexpected interest rate hike in Japan on July 31 resulting in an unwinding in Yen carry trades also contributed, with Asian markets experiencing sell-offs not seen since the pandemic. Panic in the Asian market heightened fears that the US was headed into a recession, prompting investors to liquidate high-risk assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin lost over 18 percent of its value in a 24-hour period, briefly dipping below US$50,000 for the first time since February. However, after the initial sell-off, the market began to stabilize as investors took a more measured approach to assessing the long-term implications of the economic data.

A blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions.

Blockchains are constantly growing as completed blocks are recorded and added in chronological order. The mechanism by which digital currencies are mined, blockchain has become a popular investment space as the technology is increasingly being implemented in business processes across a variety of industries. These include banking, cybersecurity, networking, supply chain management, the Internet of Things, online music, healthcare and insurance.

How to buy Bitcoin?

Bitcoin can be purchased through a variety of crypto exchange platforms and peer-to-peer crypto trading apps, and then held in a digital wallet. These include Coinbase Global, CoinSmart Financial (OTC Pink:CONMF,NEO:SMRT), BlockFi, Binance and Gemini.

What is the Bitcoin halving?

Unlike traditional currencies that can increase circulation through printing, the number of Bitcoins is finite. This limit is a core function of Bitcoin's algorithm and was designed to offset inflation by maintaining scarcity. There are 21 million in existence, of which 19,787,175 are in circulation as of August 8. This means there are 1,212,825 still unmined.

A new Bitcoin is created when a Bitcoin miner uses highly specialized software to complete a block of transaction verifications on the Bitcoin blockchain. Roughly 900 Bitcoins are currently mined per day; however, after 210,000 blocks are completed, a Bitcoin protocol called a halving automatically reduces the number of new coins issued by half. Halving not only counteracts inflation but also supports the cryptocurrency's value by ensuring that its price will increase if demand remains the same.

Halvings have occurred every four years since 2012, with the most recent happening on April 19, 2024. The next halving is expected to occur in 2028.

What is Coinbase?

Coinbase Global is a secure online cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for investors to buy, sell, transfer and store cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

How does crypto affect the banking industry?

Cryptocurrencies are an alternative to traditional banking, and tend to attract people interested in assets that are outside mainstream systems. According to data from Statista, 53 percent of crypto owners are between the ages of 18 and 34, showing that the industry is drawing younger generations who may be interested in decentralized digital options.

Privacy is a key draw for cryptocurrency owners, as is the fact that they are separated from third parties such as central banks. Additionally, crypto transactions, including purchases, sales and transfers, are often quick and have fewer associated fees than transactions going through the banking system in the typical manner.

That said, banks are starting to notice how popular cryptocurrencies are. As Bitcoin and its compatriots become increasingly mainstream, many banks have begun to invest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies themselves.

Is Bitcoin a good investment anymore?

While Bitcoin has reached new heights in 2024, one of its well-known features is its volatility. Investors who are more accepting of risk could look to the cryptocurrency space as there historically has been money to be made, and Bitcoin is regaining value after plummeting in 2022. However, there is also historically money to be lost, and investors who prefer to take smaller risks should look towards other avenues.

As for Tesla, the company purchased US$1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021, but sold 75 percent of that the next year. As of February 2024, the EV maker's Bitcoin holdings were estimated at 9,720 Bitcoin, the third-largest bitcoin holdings for a publicly traded company. In a January 2024 post on his social media platform X, Musk said ""I still own a bunch of Dogecoin, and SpaceX owns a bunch of Bitcoin.""
