Top Crypto Exchanges in 2024: Guide,https://u.today/guides/top-crypto-exchanges-in-2024-guide,2024-08-27,u.today,"Despite the market sending mixed signals for crypto traders, it is safe to say that volatility is back on the market. As such, this is the right moment to check out the best crypto exchanges for trading -- a cornerstone element of the global crypto ecosystem.

In this guide, we are going to indicate the most popular crypto exchanges and share some tips on how to choose the best crypto platform in 2024.

In 2024, there are a plethora of cryptocurrency exchanges available for traders with different backgrounds, deposit sizes, trading styles and so on.

As of 2024, Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken are typically listed among the top cryptocurrency exchanges.

Based on a variety of parameters, there is a list of the best cryptocurrency exchanges for trading and liquidity management (in no particular order):

In the following guide, we are going to focus on their specifications, pros and cons and the opportunities these platforms unlock.

A cryptocurrency exchange (crypto exchange, crypto trading platform) is an online service where users can buy and sell various digital assets (cryptocurrencies). These exchanges operate not unlike stocks, index, or ForEx markets but deal exclusively in digital currencies.

Exchanges typically offer various tools for market analysis, trading and secure storage of assets. In practice, crypto exchanges are often used as crypto wallets for only storing, receiving and transferring cryptocurrency with no conversion operations.

They play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing trading opportunities, enabling price discovery and facilitating the broader adoption of digital currencies among new generations of internet users.

As per the CoinMarketCap tracker, there are thousands of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in 2024. Due to this fact, choosing the right one might be challenging for newcomers.

As such, the platform should be secure, user-friendly, multi-product, and has to demonstrate stellar reputation in order to become part of the top crypto exchanges list.

Here is the simplest classification of cryptocurrency exchanges you need to find the one that suits you best:

On decentralized crypto exchanges, you are the one responsible for the keys from your account, while centralized platforms manage the keypairs themselves: You just log in via familiar tools.

Some exchanges only work with tokens issued on one blockchain, i.e., Bitcoin or Ethereum (for ERC-20 tokens), while the rest of crypto services work with a variety of blockchains.

Then, some exchanges accept fiat currencies from cards and bank accounts, while others only work with crypto: To top up your account, you already need to get some crypto from a third-party platform.

The vast majority of the largest crypto exchanges in the cryptocurrency world are centralized, many-blockchain, crypto-to-fiat platforms.

Now we are ready to proceed to the guide of the most popular crypto exchanges in 2024. The overview will focus on history, specifications and the main opportunities offered by the platforms.

Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken are reputable examples of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges in 2024.",https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2024-08/51260%2C1.jpg,0.3176470588235294
The U.S. Dollar's Resilience: Strength Or Illusion?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4719602-vaneck-crypto-monthly-recap-august-2024,2024-09-06,Seeking Alpha,"One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun.

By Matthew Sigel & Patrick Bush

In August, most crypto assets saw significant declines amid rising market volatility and a risk-off environment driven by macroeconomic factors such as the yen carry trade implosion.

Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below.

Most crypto assets fell sharply in August as fundamental usage and financial statistics slipped against the broader market backdrop of rising volatility. For the month of August, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 11%, Ethereum (ETH-USD) -24%, and Solana (SOL-USD) -21%, vs. the S&P +2% and the Nasdaq +1%. The market capitalization of all Smart Contract Platforms (SCP) ended August (-12%) lower than it closed in July.

Though the precipitating event for the dismal price performance was a risk-off typhoon spawned by the yen carry trade, general sentiment for crypto remained poor even after the event. The apex of the pandemonium was August 5, when BTC wicked as low as $49k while ETH crashed to $2.1k after opening the month at around $64.6k and $3.2k respectively. Though Bitcoin has regained some of its value since the ""flash crash,"" sitting around $ 58k at the time of writing, ETH is still wallowing around $2.5k. The impact of the yen carry trade implosion translated into BTC and ETH's August 30-day volatility climbing (+48%) and (+52%) higher than the previous month, as well as Bitcoin's 90-day correlation with the Nasdaq rising to an 18-month high of 38%.

Besides macro factors driving prices lower, blockchain usage deteriorated in August. For example, daily active usership was down (-10%) in August, fees generated fell (-12%), and DEX volumes sagged (-4%) compared to July. The German & US Governments also transferred 62k Bitcoin to exchanges, presumably for sale, while Mt. Gox and Gemini bankruptcy distributions totaled another 124k Bitcoin. That's $11B in non-repeatable sales, roughly equivalent to the net inflows to Bitcoin ETPs in the first two months of trading. Lastly, driving weak price action at month-end, the SEC sent a Wells Notice to OpenSea, one of the largest NFT exchanges, claiming that the company is an unregistered broker. The action is another sign that regulation by enforcement may continue in the US unless Donald Trump wins the election.

One of the most controversial issues in the month of August was the partnership between Bitgo, the custodian of WBTC, and Justin Sun. A very important DeFi ""primitive,"" WBTC, or ""Wrapped Bitcoin,"" is a token on Ethereum that is backed by Bitcoin custodied at the crypto exchange Bitgo. Someone who wishes to use mint WBTC can send their Bitcoin to Bitgo, which then issues the WBTC on Ethereum. WBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, held by Bitgo, which provides attestations of holdings.

At the time of writing, more than 153k BTC worth $9.2B have been ""wrapped"" into WBTC for use in Ethereum's DeFi. As part of the new partnership agreement, Bitgo will move custody of WBTC outside of the United States to three different Asian countries. The crypto community reacted negatively to these developments due to the negative perception of Justin Sun and past issues with other projects brought under his aegis, like USDD and TrueUSD. MakerDAO, the entity that runs the permissionless crypto-backed stablecoin DAI, passed a governance proposal banning wBTC as used for collateral to create DAI. To seize the initiative, Coinbase announced its own wrapped version of BTC called wbBTC. At the same time, Bitcoin L2 Babylon unexpectedly declared the launch of their mainnet the week after Bitgo's new custody announcement. Meanwhile, existing competitors such as tBTC and BTC.b saw modest inflows of 250 BTC and 50 BTC.

Daily Memecoin Volumes on Solana Fall Back to 2023 Levels

Source: Dune @ally as of 8/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Click to enlarge

Solana (-21%) has had a mixed month as several underlying issues surfaced to generate a minor FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) cycle. Speculation is the lifeblood of crypto, and no more is this a reality than on Solana, which accounts for ~22% of all DEX trading, of which 47% has been memecoin trading since June 1, 2024. It is apparent to many in the crypto community that Solana memecoin trading is rife with fraudulent activity. A coin supposedly associated with Donald Trump was ""rugged"" for $2M, someone hacked McDonald's Instagram account to announce a memecoin that eventually scammed buyers out of $700k, while other tokens with liquidities of <$100k are seeing daily trading volumes >$10M. The result has been that many traders on Solana have lost money due to memecoins. It is estimated that only 0.76% of wallets on Solana's top memecoin platform, pump.fun, are profitable.

Many small traders are catching on to the fact that memecoin trading is usually a zero-sum game. This change in sentiment has driven memecoin trading down (-43%) month-to-month while total DEX volume on Solana is down (-48%). As a result, Solana's monthly fees have declined (35%). On the positive front for Solana, the first (and second) spot SOL ETF debuted in Brazil, while the interesting DePIN project Grass announced its token airdrop, and the perpetual futures platform Drift launched a prediction market. The stablecoin of PayPal, PYUSD, reached $664M in supply on Solana, nearly double the $345M of PYUSD on Ethereum. In August, the total supply of all stablecoins on Solana reached $3.9B, 160% greater than a year earlier.

A budding challenge for the widespread adoption of Solana is its blockchain's massive size in computer storage space. Solana is designed to process tens of thousands of transactions per second and has consistently demonstrated this capability. Blockchain transactions are essentially ""writes"" to each blockchain's database of information. The more transactions, the more ""writes"" occur, and this causes more data to be stored on a blockchain. While Bitcoin's blocks are around 1.6MB in size and occur every 10 minutes, Solana blocks can be as large as 128MB, and these blocks occur around every half second. The result is that the Bitcoin blockchain is around 550 GB in size for 15 years of history, while Solana's chain is around 150TB (272x bigger) for roughly 4.5 years of history.

This is an issue because it makes it very difficult and expensive for people to store its history and query its contents. Looking at past events or simple things like an account's historical balances is cost-prohibitive. Solana expects private entities to spin up to provide services for those wishing to comb Solana's history. Allium, an S-tier data services provider, is one of the few entities that can effectively assess Solana's history. This presents a challenge to anyone who wants to create assets on Solana.

If an audit is to occur or an issue crops up, someone has to spend large sums of money to untangle Solana's historical archive. The instability of Solana's consensus mechanism and its history of outages add to the challenges posed by Solana's substantial history. Because of these two issues, it is nearly impossible to prove that Solana's chain has operated without any faults (double spending of currency) and without sifting through the entire chain. Though this is a challenge with any blockchain, Solana's massive data output creates novel difficulties that are not posed by lower throughput chains. It must also be noted that while history is challenging to verify by new nodes, real-time verification of chain functionality can be verified by anyone with a full node. Newer high-throughput blockchains, such as Aptos and Sui, have different design philosophies that seek to address these challenges. But realistically, Solana's big data limitations will likely plague other high-capacity blockchains.

Hosted on the Polygon blockchain, Polymarket has crept into the news cycle during the US presidential election season as an exciting use case of crypto technology. Polymarket is a permissionless prediction market that allows users to create betting markets and speculate on the outcome of off-chain events in politics, sports, finance, and popular culture. The smart contracts that power Polymarket are hosted on the Polygon blockchain. These smart contracts receive, interpret, and execute better payoffs using data brought on the chain by the crypto ""oracle"" Uma. The pseudo-anonymous nature of Polymarket combined with its limitless, global accessibility allows it to incorporate valuable information more efficiently and dynamically than is possible outside of crypto. Because people can create any market with any type of outcome without a central party to prevent the flow of information by limiting markets or betting, Polymarket is arguably a more accurate prediction engine than any web2 betting platform. While web2 companies can be pressured to censor or alter markets, Polymarket's decentralized system prevents outside parties from stopping the incentivized transfer of knowledge that prediction markets enable.

The recent attention on Polymarket has focused on its political prediction markets, such as the winner of the US presidential election or the winners of key US congressional races. Polymarket is generating enormous controversy with detractors contending that public opinion can be swayed by large-pocketed investors who manipulate prediction markets. Regardless, Polymarket usage has surged, with over $440M in wagers placed by over 60k monthly active traders in August. Recently, its data feeds have been integrated into Bloomberg terminals worldwide. Despite its popularity, Polymarket has only generated $17.9k in fees for the Polygon blockchain where it is hosted.

In stablecoin news, Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin USDT, has shelved plans to launch its blockchain, citing market saturation. Another interesting development is that Maker, the entity behind the collateral-backed stablecoin DAI, has decided to rebrand to SKY. As part of its move, Maker will upgrade its DAI token to USDS and change its governance token, MAKER, to SKY. Users can choose to upgrade their existing DAI or MAKER tokens to receive token rewards and the Sky Savings Rate, which will only be available in certain jurisdictions. As part of the sweeping changes Maker calls its ""Endgame,"" Maker will allow independent entities called Stars to launch innovative stablecoins. Meanwhile, Circle, the creator of USDC, has launched the Euro-backed stablecoin EURC on Base.

Meanwhile, the VanEck-backed Agora stablecoin1 has proven to be one of the fastest-growing stablecoins in crypto. Since its launch on August 19, it has grown to $57.5M on Avalanche and Ethereum. Agora intends to grow rapidly by expanding its presence to other chains such as Sui. This would make Agora the first fiat-backed stablecoin on Sui. Agora's strategy is to grow through revenue-sharing agreements and distribution partnerships. Some target partnerships include protocols, on-chain applications, centralized exchanges, and other important entities in crypto. Nick Van Eck, founder of Agora, believes that stablecoins will become a $10T asset class expanding to enterprises issuing their own stablecoins. For more on stablecoins, please look out for our upcoming research piece on the topic.

Breaking Down Ethereum's Struggles

One of the most confounding topics has been the consistent underperformance of ETH since the beginning of the bull market in crypto assets in November 2023. Of the 22 major L1 projects that we track, Ethereum ranks 13th with a yearly return of 62%. While this absolute return is spectacular, this is less than ½ of BTC's 138% return, and far below Solana's astounding 624% return over the same period of time. During periods of crypto price pullbacks, Ethereum has also underperformed. For example, over the past 90 days, ETH (-30%) ranks 12th place among the group of 22 and has been outshined by competitors such as BNB (-5%), Tron's TRX (+37%) and TON (-3%). More recently, over the past 30 days, ETH has been an abysmal (-23%), which ranks it 19th among the 22 layer 1 blockchains we track.

ETH is the 18th Worst Performing Asset Over the Last 30 Days

We attribute ETH's dismal performance to the following factors:

Decline in revenues Speculation moving to high throughput blockchains L2 blockchains cannibalize Ethereum's revenue items like transaction fees and MEV Deliberate policy choices Ethereum has reduced fees for its L2 customers Ethereum relies upon L2s Value Extraction by Service EntitiesL2s, data availability blockchains, staking, and re-staking take away Ethereum's value

Without question, the best use case for public blockchains at this early stage is speculation. The current monetization of SCPs relies on people moving assets or trading them on-chain. This generates revenue for blockchains through transaction fees and maximal extractable value (MEV), ultimately bringing value to tokenholders. Without speculation driving on-chain revenues, a blockchain must bank its worth on uncertain long-term potential.

Ethereum's Decline in the Face of Faster Competitors

Ethereum was once the epicenter of crypto speculation because it was the first smart contract platform to attract novel projects and allow users to speculate upon their tokens. However, the competitive landscape has changed, with more capable blockchains eating into Ethereum's once-dominant position.

These chains apply advancements in distributed systems technology to handle more transaction throughput and faster transaction processing. While Ethereum can process ~15 TPS per second with transaction confirmation times measured in minutes, chains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos can process thousands per second with confirmation latency measured in seconds. Simultaneously, the new crop of blockchains has figured out how to parallelize transactions that can be processed alongside each other. This allows transactions unrelated to congested areas on the blockchain to execute their logic unencumbered. Ethereum only allows transactions to process sequentially, and if one part of Ethereum is bombarded with demand, transactions on other parts are held in queue. As a result, the user experience for Ethereum's traders is clunky, and the number of individuals who can utilize Ethereum is limited.

Because of Ethereum's bottlenecks, developers building novel applications are increasingly deploying their projects to chains that can accommodate a better user experience and more users. These projects are also deploying their tokens to these new chains. Many innovative, non-financial crypto projects, like Helium and Hivemapper, reside on more advanced blockchains. Slowly, Ethereum is not only losing its dominance as a place to speculate, but it is also losing the tokens that appeal to speculators.

Ethereum's Diminishing Fee Revenues

Quantifying Ethereum's loss of its pole position among blockchains, since 2022, the share of all blockchain fees received by Ethereum has fallen from 86% to 33%, while its share of DEX volume has declined from 42% to 29%.

Ethereum's Shift to Layer-2: A Double-Edged Sword?

Ethereum's solution to improve its scalability, pushing transactions to L2 blockchains, has thus far failed to drive value to ETH. Not only do the L2 blockchains increasingly cut into Ethereum economics through multiple pathways, but they also offer a suboptimal user experience while still offering far less transaction throughput than Ethereum competitors.

On the first dimension, value accrual to ETH, pushing transactions to its orbiting blockchains, also moves revenue-generating components like MEV and transaction fees to those L2 chains. Though L2s remit value to Ethereum by posting proofs and batches of transactions, Ethereum's share of transaction fees in its ecosystem (Ethereum + L2s) alone has dropped from 98% to 89% since 2022. MEV is difficult to calculate but can be approximated as a portion of DEX volumes. At the start of 2023, Ethereum commanded 90% of DEX volumes in its ecosystem, whereas today, that share is around 52%. The MEV that is generated by these DEX volumes accrues to the L2s instead of Ethereum.

The shift to L2s has also expanded the amount of available Ethereum blockspace, which has lowered the price of transactions. To make transactions even less costly, Ethereum passed EIP-4844, which created a new data processing lane for batches of L2 transactions. This has reduced revenues for both Ethereum and its L2s. At the start of 2024, Ethereum collected ~$6M; in August, that figure was $1.2M. The pie has shrunk at the behest of Ethereum, lowering its blockspace pricing, and because of Layer-2s. Ethereum's share of that pie has also diminished. Compared to 180 days ago, the 7 Day Moving Average of Ethereum's fees is down (-89%)! By comparison, Bitcoin's fees have sagged (-13%) while Tron's and Solana's are up (+125%) and (+114%). This lack of fee generation has bled into Ethereum, becoming an inflationary economic system, with inflation now sitting at 0.74% and 944K of yearly issuance worth $2.45B in new supply.

New Tokens and Competitors: Ethereum's Growing Challenges

At the same time, many tokens have been launched that currently, or in the future, cleave value from Ethereum's ecosystem. These include L2, Data availability, re-staking, and staking tokens. Each of these product groups offers a competing service to Ethereum. Influential investors holding billions of dollars worth of tokens will demand that these projects cut into Ethereum's core businesses. Many of these projects have yet to launch a token, but we can estimate the value they have subtracted from Ethereum by looking at the collective FDV of their tokens. The twelve who have launched or have pre-markets for their tokens' values have captured roughly 11% of Ethereum's ecosystem value. As more projects launch tokens, there will be further competition in Ethereum's service set, driving the price of Ethereum's core services lower while offering competing investment opportunities. This pricing pressure may shrink the economic pie available to ETH holders while increasing competition for investor interest.

ETH's Share of Ethereum Ecosystem Services Token Value Has Decreased from 97% to 89% since Jan 2023

Among Ethereum L2s, Polygon and Optimism stood out this month for significant increases in developer activity, with their contracts per deployer 30-day moving averages up ~7.9x and ~4.8x, respectively. However, MATIC & OP tokens performed in the middle of the pack, down (-15%) and (-14 %), respectively. Polygon PoS developers are likely busy deploying contracts in preparation for the PIP-19 component of the broader Polygon 2.0 rollout, scheduled for September 4th. This upgrade will transition Polygon's native MATIC token to the ecosystem's next-generation POL token, which is designed to accommodate an array of ZK-based L2 chains with community staking and governance. POL is optimized for the development of the aggregated Polygon network (""AggLayer""). This network aims to be a unique scaling solution, moving beyond the current binary competition between modular and monolithic blockchain thesis dominated by Ethereum and Solana.

Polygon & Optimism Dev Outputs Surge Ahead of Upgrades

Optimism developers increased their output this month due to two main catalysts: addressing recently discovered fraud proof vulnerabilities and preparing for interoperability upgrades ahead of OP Labs' Superchain upgrade in early 2025. The Granite Network Upgrade proposal, made in response to third-party audits identifying security issues in Optimism's fault proof, includes both security and performance enhancements. The proposal passed on August 28th and is scheduled for execution on September 10th.

More proactively, Optimism announced its 'Superchain' roadmap this month, a three-milestone plan to bring interoperability to the OP Stack. According to L2Beat, nine of the top 20 Ethereum L2s are built using Optimism's OP Stack codebase. If successful, this roadmap could significantly reduce the liquidity and user fragmentation currently affecting the Ethereum L2 ecosystem. Bringing interoperability to the OP Stack could elevate its user experience to be comparable with high-performance L1s like Solana while retaining the security, applications, and user base of the Ethereum ecosystem. Adding to the Superchain's gravity, Sony Group announced the development of its own Ethereum L2, 'Soneium' that will be built using the OP Stack for both general Sony Group ecosystem applications. Additionally, Soneium will allow the exploration of new purposes, including ""...the protection of rights to creativity created by creators, new mechanisms for returning profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds."" Notably, the Japanese Prime Minister will speak at a Web3 Event in Tokyo later this year.

Arbitrum's native ARB token underperformed this month, down (-23%), with the L2 blockchain showing no meaningful increase in average developer output or total developer count. Earlier in the month, Arbitrum's DAO proposed and approved the development of an ARB staking mechanism, which plans to stream DAO-generated rewards from the L2's sequencer along with MEV, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification rewards to eligible token holders who are delegated to active governance participants.

Alongside Uniswap's UNI token, ARB was also added to the custodial business of the controversial Special Purpose Broker-Dealer, Prometheus Capital. Contrary to more nuanced takes from many crypto industry participants, Prometheum is aligned with the SEC's stance that traditional securities laws provide clear guidance on digital assets transactions. Given Uniswap's embattlement with the SEC, one could view ARB's addition to Prometheum as a bullish catalyst in terms of institutional distribution and liquidity or as a bearish catalyst in terms of exposure to the SEC. In either case, ARB appeared to lag other L2s in organic growth this month.

Base Has ~10x More Contract Deployers Than Other Top L2s

Coinbase's Base blockchain is the largest Ethereum L2 by daily active addresses. Base also boasts a substantial number of smart contract deployers. Data from Artemis.xyz shows that Base has nearly an order of magnitude more addresses deploying smart contracts on its L2 than Arbitrum, Blast, OP Mainnet, or Polygon PoS combined. Like other entrepreneurs, crypto developers must strategically anticipate where their customers will be. We think developers they are increasingly choosing to build on Coinbase's Base because it enjoys a key competitive moat: a direct-to-consumer onramp from its dominant centralized exchange.

In an increasingly fragmented L2 landscape, Coinbase's unique nexus of onchain and offchain users, developers, and liquidity offers compelling virtual real estate for building a crypto business. As Base is also part of the OP Stack, it participates in the Superchain's revenue sharing model. According to the 'Superchain Health Dashboard', Base contributed an estimated 142.45 ETH (~$367k) month-to-date to the Superchain Collective as of August 29th, second only to OP Mainnet itself. Base and Optimism thus present an interesting synergy, with Optimism potentially playing the long-term role of a relatively decentralized modular scaling solution counterpart to Coinbase's more centralized, retail-centric strategy.

August's Notable Performer - Tron (+20%)

Tron's Stablecoin Market Cap Outpaces Other Leading L1s

Up (+20%), Tron's native TRX token stood out once again this month, reaching levels not seen since April 2021. The blockchain's significant performance may largely be attributed to the mid-August launch of the Sun Pump platform Beta - a platform modeled after Solana's infamous pump.fun and named after Tron's founder Justin Sun. Sun Pump is a streamlined tool to launch meme coins in seconds. As of August 28th, Sun Pump has already launched over 56,000 meme coins on Tron, generating over 23 million TRX in revenue for an estimated $3.64 million USD. Effective August 25th, Tron executed Proposal #92 to increase the blockchain's energy cap, lowering gas fees and increasing transaction throughput in response to the increased user activity.

Sun Pump's initial success marks a significant diversification in Tron's adoption drivers, which historically have been centered around stablecoin investments and transfers in the APAC region and emerging economies. Data from Artemis, visualized in the chart above, illustrates the disproportionate amount of stablecoin value issued to the Tron blockchain relative to other leading smart contract blockchains. Indeed, while other blockchains experienced sizable drawdowns in stablecoin market caps during the bear market, Tron's blockchain demonstrated more sustained USD stablecoin retention and growth, even surpassing Ethereum as the blockchain with the most circulating Tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market cap.

However, Tron was not without headwinds or controversy this month. After the Tron DAO Reserve removed ~$732 million of Bitcoin backing the USDD stablecoin (purportedly without community vote), Justin Sun tweeted to assuage concerns, stating, ""The TRON DAO Reserve plans to spend time upgrading USDD in the future to make it a more competitive decentralized stablecoin in the market"", after lamenting that ""...the capital utilization [of USDD's reserves] is not very efficient.""

We maintain a positive view of Tron's retail market penetration as a stablecoin-centric network. However, we hold a highly cautious view of the ecosystem's exposure to Justin Sun's control, given his questionable past actions with USDD and other projects. Bluechip, a third-party stablecoin ratings agency, estimated that USDD's 53% collateralization was comprised of 69% TRX, 29% BTC, and 2% TUSD -- before the latest BTC withdrawal. USDD was initially inspired to compete with the now-collapsed UST stablecoin involved in Terra/LUNA, and we fear it risks suffering a similar fate due to its reliance on TRX for collateral. We are also concerned about the general challenges facing USDT holders who want to off-ramp their tokens to fiat. USDT can be redeemed for dollars by only a few entities, and many holders are supposed have to swap for USDC to offramp their USDT. Additionally, moving USDT from Tron to Ethereum is nearly impossible, adding to our concern of collusion between Sun and Tether to block exits for Tron's USDT holders.

August's Notable Laggard - zkSync (-24.05%)

zkSync User Growth Lags Base, Arbitrum, and Others as Ethereum L2 Ecosystem Activity Bounces

zkSync's native ZK token experienced a significant decline of (-24%) this month, driven partly by its underperforming user growth compared to other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. As the chart above illustrates, the growth of zkSync's daily active addresses -- a proxy for users -- lags that of Base, Arbitrum, and other leading L2s, even as overall activity in the Ethereum L2 ecosystem rebounds. Absent a clear negative catalyst. However, zkSync's stagnation can primarily be attributed to the vacuum left by the absence of its previous driver: airdrop farming.

Previously, zkSync fueled speculation about a potential airdrop, prompting users to interact with its network to increase their potential eligibility. For instance, a September 2023 zkSync blog post mentioned plans to ""fully decentralize the protocol's technology, community governance...,"" and emphasized ""empowering the community with ownership."" On June 11th, zkSync finally revealed details about the airdrop of its native ZK token. However, the distribution was criticized for lacking sybil resistance, a vulnerability in which a single entity can use multiple accounts to gain disproportionate amounts of airdropped tokens. After ZK token claims began the following week, one user claimed to have received over 6.6 million tokens across 350 Sybil wallets, valued at nearly $1.2 million. Simultaneously, many good-faith users found themselves ineligible for the airdrop, rubbing salt in the wounds of loyal community members and highlighting the inefficacy of zkSync's approach to ""fair"" ZK token distributions.

The combined effects of the resulting negative sentiment, lack of ongoing user incentives, and 83% overhanging ZK supply contribute to selling pressure. Moreover, the Ethereum L2 competitive landscape remains fierce, with L2s like Base gaining traction with the development of features like on-chain verification-enabled applications. It is logical that growth driven by organic demand for on-chain applications and more direct-to-consumer distribution such as Coinbase's is more sustainable than the airdrop hype that may have driven much of zkSync's initial growth.

Best Desktop Crypto Wallets in 2024: Top 11 Picks in 2024 | Guides,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/cf272-best-desktop-crypto-wallets,2024-09-04,CryptoRank,"Desktop crypto wallets have some specifics compared to mobile wallets and browser extensions, but they also have a myriad of strengths.

In this guide, we'll review some of the best desktop crypto wallets in the industry, highlighting their key features, functionalities, advantages, and disadvantages. It will also provide you with some factors to consider before choosing a wallet, such as security, compatibility, and usability.

What is a Desktop Crypto Wallet?

Desktop crypto wallets are specialized software applications that allow you to securely store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies directly from your personal computer.

They are typically non-custodial wallets, meaning you retain complete control over your private keys and, consequently, your assets. One of their main benefits is enhanced security compared to web-based alternatives and more features and options to explore and leverage.

Further, since desktop wallets only connect to the internet when necessary, they are less exposed to online crypto threats, such as hacking and phishing.

That doesn't mean they're not immune to attacks. Desktop wallets are still susceptible to risks like malware and phishing attacks that could compromise the user's computer. If, for some reason, your computer gets damaged and you don't have a backup, you've likely lost your funds too.

Pros and Cons of Crypto Desktop Wallets

While they're suitable for those who frequently work with their laptops and PCs and need to manage their crypto assets on-site, it's fair to lay out some of the advantages and disadvantages of desktop wallets. Here are some pros explained:

Now, let's go with the bad:

Best Desktop Crypto Wallets: Factors To Consider

With various options available, it's important to consider several factors to ensure the wallet you choose meets your security, compatibility, and usability needs.

Security Features

A fundamental aspect of any crypto wallet is control over private keys. Choosing a wallet that allows you to manage your private keys directly is vital. This ensures that you, not a third party, have complete control over your funds, providing an additional layer of security.

For enhanced security, look for wallets that support two-factor authentication (2FA). This feature requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device, before granting access to your wallet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Similarly, check the wallet's encryption standards and key storage methods. Strong encryption protocols and secure key storage are critical in protecting your wallet from potential breaches and unauthorized access. A wallet with robust backup options ensures that you can easily regain access to your digital assets, minimizing the risk of permanently losing your funds.

Compatibility and Usability

It might be obvious, but make sure your wallet is compatible with your device and operating system, whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Moreover, make sure your wallet supports hardware integration if you're looking for extra compatibility and usability with other devices. There are certain additional features to keep an eye on. For example, some desktop wallets offer built-in conversion features, enabling users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. This allows you to rebalance your portfolio without transferring funds to an external exchange.

Also, make sure the wallet you choose supports the cryptocurrency you plan to use. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to download it.

Development and Support

Choose a wallet that is actively developed and regularly updated with the latest technological advancements and security patches. Moreover, check for customer support services and make sure it is at least decent enough to guide you through basic questions.

Again, desktop wallets are not a replacement for hardware wallets, which are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency over the long term. Desktop wallets, however, are suitable for holding smaller amounts that you need to access more frequently.

What are Some Other Alternatives to Desktop Wallets?

Cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms and colors, each offering distinct advantages and features tailored to different user needs. Hot wallets and cold storage are two popular methods of storing digital assets today.

Let's begin with hot wallets.

Hot wallets are software applications designed to manage and transact cryptocurrencies. These wallets are always connected to the internet and are available on various platforms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop, of course. What makes these applications popular is their ease of use and accessibility, making them a common choice for daily transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Types of Hot Wallets

Web Wallets: Typically installed as browser extensions on popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. They allow you to manage, store, and transact cryptocurrencies directly through web browsers. They often support dApps, Web3 applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Mobile Wallets: Designed for iOS and Android devices, mobile wallets offer the convenience of managing digital assets on the go. However, be careful of exposing your phone to malware, and beware that there's always the chance you may lose the device.

Cold Wallets: The Secure Alternative

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. Their offline status greatly reduces the risk of hacking and other online threats.

Cold wallets, another term for it, are especially suited for those looking to store crypto for the long run and seek a device with a level of security. Here are some of the key features of cold wallets:

A desktop wallet for cryptocurrencies is a software tool designed to be installed on a user's computer, enabling them to store, manage, and transfer digital currencies securely.

One of the key features of these wallets is that they grant users direct control over their private keys, ensuring that they maintain full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

Can I Access my Desktop Wallet From Multiple Devices?

Typically, desktop wallets are designed to maximize security by being used on a single device. But some wallets offer features that allow users to sync their wallet data between devices, often through cloud storage or other methods. It's essential to review the specific features of the wallet you are considering to understand its capabilities regarding multi-device access.

What to Do in Case I Lose My Desktop Wallet?

If you lose access to your desktop wallet or the stored device, you can restore it using a recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. This phrase is a critical backup that allows you to regain access to your digital assets. Make sure you save your recovery phrase securely and never share it with anyone, as it is the key to restoring your wallet.

Closing Thoughts

Desktop wallets have become popular among crypto enthusiasts because they provide a secure environment for managing various cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency Development: Creating and Managing Digital Currencies,https://techbullion.com/cryptocurrency-development-creating-and-managing-digital-currencies/,2024-09-03,TechBullion,"The world of finance is fast changing. One of the most significant developments in recent years is the rise of cryptocurrency. This digital form of money has revolutionized the way people think about and use currency. The creation and management of digital currencies involve complex processes, but they offer tremendous opportunities for both individuals and businesses.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, often based on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This decentralized structure makes cryptocurrencies resistant to censorship and fraud.

Bitcoin, created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been developed, each with unique features and use cases. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.

Cryptocurrencies are often seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems. They offer greater transparency, lower transaction costs, and faster transfer times compared to conventional banking methods. However, they also come with risks, including volatility and regulatory uncertainty.

The Process of Creating a Cryptocurrency

Creating a cryptocurrency is a multi-step process that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography. Below are the key steps involved in developing a digital currency:

Define the Purpose of the Cryptocurrency

Before creating a cryptocurrency, it's essential to define its purpose. What problem does it solve? What is its target audience? For example, Bitcoin was created as a decentralized alternative to traditional currency. Ethereum, on the other hand, was developed to enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Defining the purpose of the cryptocurrency will guide its development and help differentiate it from the thousands of other digital currencies in the market.

Choose a Consensus Algorithm

A consensus algorithm is a process used by blockchain networks to validate transactions and ensure the integrity of the ledger. There are several types of consensus algorithms, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The most common algorithms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). PoW, used by Bitcoin, requires participants to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. PoS, used by Ethereum, allows participants to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold. The choice of consensus algorithm will impact the security, speed, and energy efficiency of the cryptocurrency.

Design the Blockchain Architecture

The blockchain architecture determines how the cryptocurrency will function. This includes deciding whether to use an existing blockchain platform, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, or to create a new one from scratch. Using an existing platform can save time and resources, but it may limit customization options. On the other hand, building a new blockchain allows for greater flexibility but requires significant technical expertise and resources.

Develop the Cryptocurrency Code

Once the blockchain architecture is in place, the next step is to develop the cryptocurrency code. This involves writing the code that will govern the creation, distribution, and management of the cryptocurrency. This code is typically written in programming languages such as C++, Python, or Solidity. It is crucial to ensure that the code is secure and free from vulnerabilities, as any weaknesses could be exploited by hackers.

Create the Cryptocurrency Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that allows users to store, send, and receive digital currencies. There are different types of wallets, including desktop wallets, mobile wallets, and hardware wallets. When developing a cryptocurrency, it's essential to create a wallet that is user-friendly and secure. The wallet should also support multiple platforms to ensure accessibility for a wide range of users.

Launch the Cryptocurrency

After the cryptocurrency code and wallet have been developed, the next step is to launch the cryptocurrency. This involves deploying the blockchain network, distributing the initial supply of coins or tokens, and making the cryptocurrency available for trading on exchanges. It's also important to create a marketing strategy to promote the cryptocurrency and attract users.

Maintain and Update the Cryptocurrency

Launching a cryptocurrency is just the beginning. To ensure its long-term success, it's essential to maintain and update the cryptocurrency regularly. This includes fixing bugs, implementing new features, and addressing security vulnerabilities. It's also important to engage with the community and gather feedback to improve the cryptocurrency over time.

Managing Digital Currencies

Once a cryptocurrency has been created, managing it effectively is crucial to its success. Managing digital currencies involves overseeing their distribution, ensuring their security, and promoting their adoption. Below are some key aspects of managing digital currencies:

Security

Security is one of the most critical aspects of managing digital currencies. Given the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, they are often targeted by hackers. To protect digital currencies from theft and fraud, it's essential to implement robust security measures. This includes using encryption, multi-signature wallets, and cold storage solutions to safeguard funds. Regular security audits and updates are also necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Regulation

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies widely from country to country. In some jurisdictions, cryptocurrencies are fully legal and regulated, while in others, they are banned or restricted. Managing digital currencies requires staying informed about the latest regulatory developments and ensuring compliance with local laws. This may involve registering the cryptocurrency with regulatory authorities, implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, and paying taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.

Adoption and Use

For a cryptocurrency to succeed, it must be widely adopted and used. This involves promoting the cryptocurrency to potential users, businesses, and investors. One way to increase adoption is to create partnerships with businesses that accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment. It's also important to make the cryptocurrency easy to use by developing user-friendly wallets and payment systems. Encouraging the development of dApps and other use cases for the cryptocurrency can also help drive adoption.

Community Engagement

Building a strong community is essential for the long-term success of a cryptocurrency. Engaging with the community through social media, forums, and events can help build trust and loyalty among users. It's also important to listen to feedback from the community and address any concerns or issues that arise. A strong and active community can help promote the cryptocurrency and drive its adoption.

Market Dynamics

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, with prices often fluctuating dramatically. Managing digital currencies requires staying informed about market trends and making strategic decisions to protect the value of the cryptocurrency. This may involve adjusting the supply of the cryptocurrency, implementing price stabilization mechanisms, or engaging in market-making activities. It's also important to monitor the performance of competitors and adapt to changes in the market.

Challenges and Opportunities in Cryptocurrency Development

Cryptocurrency development presents both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, creating and managing a digital currency requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, programming, and cryptography. It also involves navigating complex regulatory environments and managing security risks. On the other hand, the potential rewards are significant. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, create new business models, and empower individuals and communities.

One of the biggest challenges in cryptocurrency development is scalability. As the number of users and transactions on a blockchain network increases, so does the strain on the network's resources. This can lead to slower transaction times and higher fees. To address this challenge, developers are exploring solutions such as sharding, layer-2 scaling, and new consensus algorithms.

Another challenge is regulatory uncertainty. The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies widely from country to country, and regulations are constantly evolving. This creates uncertainty for developers and users, making it difficult to plan for the future. However, regulatory clarity is gradually improving, with more governments recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities in cryptocurrency development are vast. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more. They can enable faster and cheaper cross-border payments, increase financial inclusion, and create new opportunities for innovation.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrency development is a complex but rewarding endeavor. It involves creating a digital currency from scratch, managing its security, promoting its adoption, and navigating regulatory challenges. While the road to success is not without obstacles, the potential rewards are significant. As the world becomes increasingly digital, cryptocurrencies will play an essential role in shaping the future of finance and beyond.

As a software solution that runs directly on your computer, Wasabi Wallet empowers users to manage their bitcoins while prioritizing the confidentiality of their transactions.

Wasabi Wallet is packed with features aimed at enhancing user privacy and security. Here are some of the most notable:

The wallet is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify it. Besides transparency, the wallet also puts a special focus on anonymity; the CoinJoin coordinator used by Wasabi cannot access or compromise the privacy of the participants. This ensures that the mixing process remains secure and anonymous.

Moreover, Wasabi Wallet implements hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, avoids address reuse, and mandates coin labeling, all contributing to maintaining user privacy and security.

Currently, Wasabi Wallet supports only Bitcoin, reflecting its focus on providing a specialized, privacy-centric tool for Bitcoin users.

While they're suitable for those who frequently work with their laptops and PCs and need to manage their crypto assets on-site, it's fair to lay out some of the advantages and disadvantages of desktop wallets. Here are some pros explained:

Now, let's go with the bad:

With various options available, it's important to consider several factors to ensure the wallet you choose meets your security, compatibility, and usability needs.

A fundamental aspect of any crypto wallet is control over private keys. Choosing a wallet that allows you to manage your private keys directly is vital. This ensures that you, not a third party, have complete control over your funds, providing an additional layer of security.

For enhanced security, look for wallets that support two-factor authentication (2FA). This feature requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile device, before granting access to your wallet, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Similarly, check the wallet's encryption standards and key storage methods. Strong encryption protocols and secure key storage are critical in protecting your wallet from potential breaches and unauthorized access. A wallet with robust backup options ensures that you can easily regain access to your digital assets, minimizing the risk of permanently losing your funds.

It might be obvious, but make sure your wallet is compatible with your device and operating system, whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Moreover, make sure your wallet supports hardware integration if you're looking for extra compatibility and usability with other devices. There are certain additional features to keep an eye on. For example, some desktop wallets offer built-in conversion features, enabling users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet. This allows you to rebalance your portfolio without transferring funds to an external exchange.

Also, make sure the wallet you choose supports the cryptocurrency you plan to use. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to download it.

Choose a wallet that is actively developed and regularly updated with the latest technological advancements and security patches. Moreover, check for customer support services and make sure it is at least decent enough to guide you through basic questions.

Again, desktop wallets are not a replacement for hardware wallets, which are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency over the long term. Desktop wallets, however, are suitable for holding smaller amounts that you need to access more frequently.

Cryptocurrency wallets come in various forms and colors, each offering distinct advantages and features tailored to different user needs. Hot wallets and cold storage are two popular methods of storing digital assets today.

Let's begin with hot wallets.

Hot wallets are software applications designed to manage and transact cryptocurrencies. These wallets are always connected to the internet and are available on various platforms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop, of course. What makes these applications popular is their ease of use and accessibility, making them a common choice for daily transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Web Wallets: Typically installed as browser extensions on popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. They allow you to manage, store, and transact cryptocurrencies directly through web browsers. They often support dApps, Web3 applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Mobile Wallets: Designed for iOS and Android devices, mobile wallets offer the convenience of managing digital assets on the go. However, be careful of exposing your phone to malware, and beware that there's always the chance you may lose the device.

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. Their offline status greatly reduces the risk of hacking and other online threats.

Cold wallets, another term for it, are especially suited for those looking to store crypto for the long run and seek a device with a level of security. Here are some of the key features of cold wallets:

A desktop wallet for cryptocurrencies is a software tool designed to be installed on a user's computer, enabling them to store, manage, and transfer digital currencies securely.

One of the key features of these wallets is that they grant users direct control over their private keys, ensuring that they maintain full ownership and responsibility for their digital assets.

Typically, desktop wallets are designed to maximize security by being used on a single device. But some wallets offer features that allow users to sync their wallet data between devices, often through cloud storage or other methods. It's essential to review the specific features of the wallet you are considering to understand its capabilities regarding multi-device access.

If you lose access to your desktop wallet or the stored device, you can restore it using a recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. This phrase is a critical backup that allows you to regain access to your digital assets. Make sure you save your recovery phrase securely and never share it with anyone, as it is the key to restoring your wallet.

Desktop wallets have become popular among crypto enthusiasts because they provide a secure environment for managing various cryptocurrencies. This guide on the best desktop crypto wallets highlights some of the top options in the market today.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/best_desktop_wallets_cover.jpg,0.1529411764705881
Most Downloaded Crypto Wallets in 2024 | Bitcoinist.com,https://bitcoinist.com/most-downloaded-crypto-wallets-in-2024/,2024-09-13,Bitcoinist.com,"The global cryptocurrency wallet market was valued at $10.28 billion in 2023, and it is expected to surpass $94.45 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.83% from 2024 to 2033. Currently, cryptocurrency wallets account for nearly 25% of sales in the overall cryptocurrency market. According to Statista, in March 2024 alone, downloads of the largest cryptocurrency storage apps worldwide exceeded 23 million.

One of the key advantages of cryptocurrency wallets is their capacity to securely store users' private keys or passwords, making their cryptocurrencies safe and accessible. This allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Crypto wallets are often the first point of contact with blockchain for most novice users as they begin exploring the world of cryptocurrency, making the quality of these wallets a crucial factor in determining whether a user continues their crypto journey. This article will review the latest and most popular crypto wallets on the market and explain why they deserve their place in our rankings.

Bitget Wallet has recently reported reaching 12 million monthly active users -- a record metric in the market. It is now the top Web3 wallet by app downloads, surpassing MetaMask and hitting the milestone of 30 million users, making it the largest Web3 wallet on the market.

The key to its popularity lies in its multifunctionality and advanced user experience. Bitget Wallet was the first to achieve multi-chain aggregation, allowing users to interact with decentralized apps across various blockchains -- all within a single app. This gives Bitget Wallet an edge over MetaMask, which has traditionally focused on the Ethereum ecosystem.

Additionally, Bitget Wallet offers on-chain token charts and cross-chain transactions and integrates NFT markets and launchpads on multiple chains. It has integrated with over 100 major public and EVM-compatible blockchain networks, making it the best all-in-one entry point for crypto users.

Bitget Wallet's security is backed by cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, a leader in spot and derivatives trading. It boasts a unique DESM encryption algorithm and a $300 million User Protection Fund, providing a strong security track record.

Being the longest-tenured and most well-known crypto wallet in the market, MetaMask is probably an app that started it all for many crypto enthusiasts years ago.

MetaMask's feature set has significantly expanded over the years. Originally designed for Ethereum tokens, it now includes an NFT gallery, a token bridge, Ethereum staking capabilities, and the MetaMask Portfolio, a suite of tools that offers experienced users more control over their digital assets.

In August, MetaMask launched the world's first crypto payment card in partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. This launch will likely have a significant impact on the industry as a whole as it will contribute to the global mass adoption of crypto into everyday casual use.

However, its market-leading status comes with both advantages and challenges. As the most popular software wallet, MetaMask has become a target for hackers and has sparked debates about its decentralization, with some users concerned about the level of authority it holds in the Web3 space.

Tangem stands out in the 2024 crypto wallet landscape with its blend of security, simplicity, and versatility. Available in two forms -- a plastic card and a zirconia ceramic ring -- Tangem emphasizes top-tier protection with its EAL6+ certified hardware, safeguarding against both invasive and non-invasive attacks.

The wallet's firmware has undergone independent audits by Kudelski Security and Riscure, ensuring the absence of backdoors and maintaining firmware integrity with no updates allowed post-installation. Tangem supports over 6,000 cryptocurrencies across 65+ blockchain networks, providing users with robust management capabilities including buying, selling, and swapping assets. Its IP68-rated durability ensures resistance to dust, water, EMP, ESD, and X-rays, while NFC connectivity simplifies asset management through the Tangem mobile app without needing additional power sources.

Additionally, Tangem Express offers secure, competitive token swaps. This combination of advanced security features, extensive cryptocurrency support, and durable design makes Tangem a compelling choice for crypto enthusiasts.

Coin Wallet was founded by CoinSpace LLC in 2015, starting with both mobile and browser versions. Initially focused solely on Bitcoin, the wallet evolved over the years, reflecting the growing diversity of the cryptocurrency landscape. By 2021, Coin Wallet launched its desktop application, expanding its user base by offering more flexibility across devices.

In response to market demand, the wallet's supported assets grew steadily. By 2021, Binance Smart Chain tokens and Dogecoin were integrated, with further additions in 2022, including Cardano, Ethereum Classic, Solana, and Tron. A significant milestone came later that year when Coin Wallet became one of the first platforms to support the Monero hard fork, solidifying its position as a forward-thinking and adaptable platform.

By 2024, Coin Wallet had introduced support for Toncoin, Fantom, Optimism, and their respective tokens, bringing the total to 21 supported currencies, not counting the hundreds of tokens available. Today, Coin Wallet is used by over 24 million wallets across 190 countries, making it the most popular and secure non-custodial multicurrency wallet.

Not only does this wallet have the most desirable name and URL on the market, but it has deservingly earned its spot as one of the safest and most secure wallets in the sector.

Crypto.com has a stellar reputation with regulation compliance, and though it did face an exploit back in 2022, since then the wallet has incorporated top-notch encryption technology, and biometric and multi-factor authentication to protect its users.

What sets it apart is its seamless integration with the entire Crypto.com ecosystem, allowing users to trade, earn, and even spend crypto with the Crypto.com Visa card.

In August, Crypto.com announced that its US users can now purchase cryptocurrencies with PayPal, allowing people to seamlessly buy crypto in a much faster and more convenient manner. This feature is set to attract many new US-based users to the wallet given that PayPal is a well-established and trusted payment option with a good history in the region.",https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17437.jpeg,0.2705882352941176

Discover how these digital assets are poised to influence the global financial ecosystem and what the future might hold for them in different parts of the world.

Definition of Altcoins and Their Distinction from Bitcoin

Altcoins (short for 'alternative coins') refer to any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most widely recognised and valued, altcoins have emerged as alternatives with different purposes, functionalities, and technologies. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange, altcoins often aim to improve upon Bitcoin's limitations or offer entirely new features. For instance, Ethereum, the most prominent altcoin, introduced smart contracts that allow for decentralised applications, while others, like Litecoin, focus on faster transaction speeds.

Overview of the Current Altcoin Market

The market for altcoins has grown exponentially since the early days of cryptocurrency. Today, there are thousands of altcoins, each with unique use cases and technological innovations. The market capitalisation of altcoins has increased significantly, accounting for a substantial portion of the overall cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, the combined market cap of altcoins has been steadily rising, driven by the increasing adoption of decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain-based solutions across various industries. However, the altcoin market remains highly volatile, influenced by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment.

Importance of Altcoins for Global and Local Economies

Altcoins play a crucial role in both global and local economies. On a global scale, they contribute to the diversification of the cryptocurrency market, offering investors and users a broader range of options beyond Bitcoin. Altcoins have also been at the forefront of technological innovation, driving the development of decentralised applications, smart contracts, and blockchain solutions that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries. Locally, altcoins can empower emerging markets by providing access to financial services, enabling cross-border transactions, and fostering economic inclusion. In countries with unstable currencies or limited access to banking, altcoins can offer alternative financial systems, thus enhancing economic resilience and promoting growth.

Altcoins by Region

1.1. Americas

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum, developed in the United States, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and the most significant altcoin in terms of impact and innovation. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just a digital currency, it is a decentralised platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). Its introduction of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with Ethereum 2.0 have solidified its position as a leading technology in the blockchain space.

Supported by the European Union, IOTA is being integrated into various smart city projects and industrial applications across the continent. The growth of IoT and smart infrastructure in Europe bodes well for IOTA's future adoption and success.

1.3. Asia

Binance Coin (BNB)

Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the most prominent altcoins in Asia, originating from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which was initially founded in China before relocating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. BNB was initially created as a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, but its use has expanded significantly. BNB is now integral to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralised applications. BSC has gained popularity due to its low transaction fees and faster processing times compared to Ethereum, making BNB a central player in the Asian and global crypto markets. The widespread adoption of Binance's ecosystem across Asia positions BNB as a key altcoin with strong growth potential.

NEO

Often referred to as the 'Chinese Ethereum', NEO is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency enabling digital assets and smart contracts development. NEO was developed in China and is designed to digitise various assets using smart contracts, focusing on regulatory compliance and a digital identity system. NEO's dual-token system, featuring NEO and GAS tokens, allows for the smooth operation of the network and provides incentives for developers and users. Despite strict cryptocurrency regulations in China, NEO has managed to maintain relevance, especially in projects that require a combination of blockchain technology and regulatory oversight. With China's growing interest in adopting blockchain technology for its digital economy, NEO is well-positioned to play a significant role in the region's blockchain development.

Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is an Indian-origin blockchain platform that addresses some of Ethereum's major scalability issues. By providing a Layer 2 scaling solution, Polygon enhances transaction speed and reduces fees on the Ethereum network. With the growing interest in decentralised finance and the increasing number of dApps being built on the Ethereum platform, Polygon's importance and adoption are likely to grow. Its strong foundation in India, a country with a burgeoning tech industry, positions Polygon as a critical player in the global altcoin market.

Vexanium (VEX)

Vexanium is a blockchain platform from Indonesia designed to support decentralised applications (dApps) and digital marketing solutions. It aims to provide an accessible blockchain platform for businesses and developers in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. Vexanium's focus on local businesses and its adaptability to regional markets give it a unique edge in the Asian altcoin landscape. As blockchain adoption increases in Southeast Asia, Vexanium has the potential to grow significantly within this emerging market.

2.1. Technological Innovations

Impact of DeFi and NFTs on Altcoin Development

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have been among the most significant drivers of technological innovation in the altcoin space. DeFi platforms allow users to access financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries, using smart contracts on blockchain networks. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon have become central to the DeFi ecosystem due to their ability to support these decentralized applications (dApps). The growth of DeFi has also led to the creation of numerous specialized altcoins that cater specifically to this market, offering unique features and governance models.

Similarly, NFTs have opened new avenues for digital ownership and creativity, with altcoins like Ethereum and Binance Coin playing crucial roles in the minting and trading of NFTs. The rise of NFTs has also sparked the development of new blockchain networks optimized for these tokens, further diversifying the altcoin market. As DeFi and NFT adoption continue to expand, altcoins that support or innovate within these sectors are likely to see increased demand and development.

Advancement of Smart Contracts and Network Scalability

Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, have revolutionized the way transactions and agreements are handled on blockchain networks. Ethereum pioneered this technology, but many other altcoins have since built upon and improved it. For example, Cardano's use of a formal development model and peer-reviewed research in the implementation of smart contracts aims to enhance security and scalability.

Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges for blockchain networks, and various altcoins are addressing this in different ways. Solana's proof-of-history consensus mechanism allows it to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains available. Similarly, Polygon's Layer 2 solution helps alleviate congestion on the Ethereum network by handling transactions off-chain, significantly reducing fees and improving transaction speed. These innovations in smart contracts and scalability are critical for the continued growth and adoption of altcoins.

2.2. Regulatory Issues

Variations in Cryptocurrency Regulations Across Countries

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies significantly from one country to another, impacting the development and adoption of altcoins. In the United States, regulatory bodies like the SEC have been scrutinising cryptocurrencies with a focus on ensuring compliance with securities laws. While this regulatory uncertainty can create challenges for altcoins operating within the U.S., it also pushes developers to create more robust and compliant systems.

In Europe, regulations are generally more liberal, with the European Union working on frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation to provide clarity and support for the growth of digital assets. Altcoins in Europe, such as IOTA and Cardano, benefit from this relatively favourable regulatory environment, which encourages innovation while protecting investors.

Asia presents a mixed regulatory landscape. Some countries, like China, have imposed strict regulations, including outright bans on cryptocurrency trading, which pose challenges for NEO and other Chinese altcoins. However, other countries in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, have adopted more crypto-friendly regulations, allowing for the development and growth of local altcoins. India's regulatory stance is rapidly evolving via ongoing discussions about regulating cryptocurrencies, which will significantly impact the future of Indian altcoins like Polygon.

Impact of Regulations on Altcoin Development and Adoption

Regulations play a pivotal role in adopting and developing altcoins. Strict regulations can hinder the growth of altcoins by limiting their accessibility and use cases. Conversely, clear and supportive regulations can foster innovation and encourage the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. For instance, the positive regulatory environment in countries like Switzerland has made it a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation, attracting projects from around the world.

In contrast, ambiguous or hostile regulations can stifle innovation and drive projects to relocate to more favourable jurisdictions. The regulatory environment also affects investor confidence, with clear regulations providing a sense of security and encouraging institutional investment in altcoins. As global regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the adaptability of altcoins to these changes will be crucial to their long-term success.

2.3. Economic Factors

Impact of Economic Unrest on Altcoins' Appeal

Economic instability, such as inflation, currency devaluation, and financial crises, often drives interest in cryptocurrencies, including altcoins. In countries experiencing hyperinflation or a lack of trust in the local currency, citizens may turn to altcoins as a store of value or a means of conducting transactions. For example, in Venezuela, where inflation has reached extreme levels, altcoins like Dash have gained popularity as alternatives to the national currency.

Similarly, in countries with unstable political or economic environments, altcoins can provide a hedge against local economic conditions. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies allows users to bypass traditional financial systems, offering a level of financial autonomy that is particularly appealing in times of economic uncertainty.

Role of Altcoins in the Development of Digital Economies

Altcoins are increasingly playing a crucial role in developing digital economies, particularly in emerging markets. By offering alternatives to traditional financial systems, altcoins can foster financial inclusion, especially in regions with limited access to banking services. Altcoins also enable the creation of new economic models, such as token economies, where users can earn, trade, and spend tokens within specific ecosystems.

According to Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa Broker, 'As digital economies continue to expand, the role of altcoins in these ecosystems is likely to increase, offering new opportunities for economic growth and innovation.'

Octa is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011.

Before diving into the world of crypto dice casino sites, it's important to grasp the basics of cryptocurrency. Simply put, cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for secure financial transactions.

Unlike traditional currency, it operates independently of a central bank and is decentralized. This offers benefits such as low transaction fees and faster processing times.

The Basics of Cryptocurrency

In order to use cryptocurrency on casino sites, it is essential to understand how it works. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets, which can be either software-based or hardware-based.

Wallets provide the necessary encryption tools to secure transactions and store cryptocurrency securely. Popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, offer different features and levels of security.

By familiarizing yourself with the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, you'll be better equipped to make informed decisions when using it on casino sites.

The Rise of Crypto Dice Casino Sites

What exactly are crypto dice casino sites, and why are they gaining popularity?

Crypto dice casinos are online gambling platforms that solely accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

These innovative sites offer dice games that provide players with a simple yet thrilling way to test their luck.

It's beneficial to check if the crypto dice casino site employs provably fair technology. This technology allows players to verify the fairness of each game's outcome, ensuring that the results are not manipulated.

By choosing a platform that utilizes provably fair systems, you can trust that your gaming experience is free from any form of cheating or bias.

Assessing the Variety of Games and Betting Options

Ensure that the site offers a wide range of dice games to suit your preferences and provides flexible betting options to accommodate different budgets. A diverse selection of games will keep you entertained and engaged for longer periods.

Crypto dice games are online gambling games where players bet on the outcome of a dice roll using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. These games typically involve predicting whether the result of a dice roll will be above or below a certain number.

2. How do crypto dice sites ensure fairness?

Most reputable crypto dice sites use a ""provably fair"" system. This cryptographic algorithm allows players to verify each roll's fairness independently. It typically involves a combination of a server seed, a client seed, and a nonce, which together determine the roll's outcome.

The legality of crypto dice sites varies by jurisdiction. In many countries, online gambling laws haven't caught up with cryptocurrency technology. It's crucial to check your local laws before participating. Remember, even if it's legal in your area, you're responsible for reporting any winnings for tax purposes.

5. How do I deposit and withdraw funds?

To deposit, you typically need to send cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the address provided by the dice site. Withdrawals work similarly - you request a withdrawal to your wallet address. Always double-check addresses to avoid losing funds.

6. What's the house edge in crypto dice games?

The house edge varies by platform but is typically between 1% and 2%. Some sites offer even lower house edges as low as 0.5%. Always check the specific odds and house edge for each game before playing.

7. Can I play crypto dice games on mobile devices?

Yes, most modern crypto dice sites are mobile-friendly and can be accessed through your smartphone or tablet's web browser. Some platforms even offer dedicated mobile apps for a smoother experience.

8. What's the difference between automatic and manual betting?

Automatic betting allows you to set parameters (like bet amount, number of bets, and stop conditions) and let the system place bets for you. Manual betting requires you to input your bet for each roll manually. Automatic can be faster but carries risks if not monitored carefully.

9. Are there bonuses or rewards programs on crypto dice sites?

Many sites offer welcome bonuses, deposit matches, cashback programs, or loyalty points. However, always read the terms and conditions carefully, as these often come with wagering requirements or other restrictions.

What Are NFT DApps?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-are-nft-dapps/,2024-08-28,Forbes,"Non-fungible tokens and decentralized applications are changing how we own and trade digital assets. NFT dApps combine these technologies, creating platforms for digital art, gaming and more. This article explores NFT dApps and their impact on various industries.

NFT dApps have become a cornerstone of the Web3 ecosystem, driving significant transaction volumes. These platforms are reshaping creator economies by enabling direct-to-fan sales and automated royalties. For investors, NFT dApps offer exposure to an emerging asset class with potential for high-value transactions.

NFTs are digital tokens that represent ownership of unique items or content on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, each NFT has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. They provide verifiable proof of ownership for digital assets.

NFTs have transformed how digital content is valued and traded. Creators can now sell their work directly to buyers, eliminating traditional middlemen. This shift has opened new revenue streams for artists and given collectors assurance of authenticity. NFTs can represent various digital assets, including art, music, virtual real estate and in-game items.

NFTs are cryptographic tokens with unique identifiers stored on a blockchain. Each token has distinct metadata and asset information, making it non-fungible. For example, an NFT representing digital art includes data like the artist's wallet address, creation date, and a link to the artwork file.

Blockchain records every NFT transaction, creating a verifiable ownership trail. This data is public and immutable. Users can trace an NFT's history from its creation through all transfers using block explorers. Smart contracts automate NFT functions like minting, transferring ownership and executing royalty payments to creators on secondary sales.

Digital art NFTs entered the mainstream spotlight with Beeple's $69 million ""Everydays"" sale at Christie's in 2021. CryptoPunks, 10,000 unique pixel art characters, have traded for millions. Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs serve as both digital art and access passes to exclusive events and merchandise. In sports, NBA Top Shot offers licensed video clip collectibles of memorable plays.

Gaming NFTs include Axie Infinity's breedable creatures and Decentraland's virtual land parcels. Music NFTs from Kings of Leon and Grimes offer exclusive content and experiences. Virtual fashion NFTs by Gucci have sold in online environments. Twitter's founder sold his first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million.

dApps are software programs that run on blockchain networks rather than centralized servers. They operate on peer-to-peer networks, eliminating the need for intermediaries. dApps leverage smart contracts to automate processes and ensure transparent, trustless interactions.

dApps increase security through blockchain's immutable nature. They also enhance privacy as users maintain control of their data. Finally, dApps improve transparency because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger.

dApps operate on blockchain networks, using smart contracts to automate processes without central authorities. Their open-source code allows public review and encourages community contributions. dApps use native tokens or cryptocurrencies for in-app transactions and governance. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake or Proof of Work validate transactions and maintain network integrity. These applications store immutable transaction records on the blockchain, boosting transparency and security.

Many dApps integrate with Web3 wallets for user authentication and transactions. They often utilize decentralized storage solutions to store and retrieve data. Tokenomics models incentivize user participation and network growth in many dApps. Interoperability protocols allow dApps to connect across blockchains, expanding their utility.

Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, processes cryptocurrency trades without intermediaries. Aave runs a lending and borrowing platform. Axie Infinity players earn crypto by breeding and battling digital creatures. Compound users lend crypto assets for interest.

OpenSea hosts an NFT marketplace. Chainlink delivers oracle data to smart contracts. MakerDAO issues the DAI stablecoin through collateralized positions. Curve Finance optimizes stablecoin trading with low fees and slippage.

NFT dApps help users to create, buy, sell and trade unique digital assets without intermediaries. These platforms combine NFT scarcity and authenticity with dApp decentralization for peer-to-peer transactions.

Smart contracts in NFT dApps automate minting, ownership transfers and royalty management. This creates new digital ownership models across industries. Artists sell directly to collectors, gamers trade in-game items, and users buy virtual real estate in metaverses. NFT dApps are reshaping markets in art, gaming and entertainment, while opening new investment opportunities in the digital space.

NFT dApps can be categorized based on their primary functions and the industries they cater to. The main types include marketplace dApps, gaming dApps, art and collectible dApps, and social and metaverse dApps. Each type offers unique features and benefits to users in the NFT ecosystem.

NFT marketplace dApps let users mint, buy, sell and trade NFTs on blockchain networks. These platforms use smart contracts to automate listings, auctions and instant sales without intermediaries. They verify ownership, manage royalties and provide secure storage for digital assets.

In the blockchain ecosystem, NFT marketplaces create liquidity for digital assets. They connect creators directly with collectors, creating new economic models for digital content. These dApps support standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 on Ethereum, as well as other blockchain-specific formats. This allows users to trade NFTs created on different networks, increasing market reach and asset liquidity.

OpenSea leads the NFT marketplace space with $37.33 billion in trading volume. Blur has risen as a strong competitor, achieving $11 billion in volume. LooksRare and Magic Eden follow, each with $4 billion in trading volume. Another popular platform is Rarible, which recently partnered with Forbes Web3 to conduct a Web3 art contest spotlighting emerging digital artists. SuperRare is also a notable marketplace, focusing on high-end digital art NFTs.

Gaming dApps integrate NFTs as in-game assets, allowing players to truly own and trade their virtual items. This model, often called ""play-to-earn,"" enables gamers to monetize their time and skills within the game ecosystem. NFTs in gaming can represent characters, weapons, land or other tradable assets.

The Sandbox offers a virtual world for building and monetizing experiences. Alien Worlds features NFT-based mining and combat. Gods Unchained gives players ownership of digital trading cards. Sorare focuses on fantasy football with NFT player cards.

Art and collectible dApps focus on creating, showcasing and trading digital art and unique collectibles as NFTs. These platforms provide artists with new ways to monetize their work and offer collectors verifiable ownership of digital assets. They often include features like provenance tracking and royalty distribution.

Foundation operates as a decentralized platform for artists to mint and auction digital artworks. SuperRare runs on Ethereum, allowing artists to tokenize and sell single-edition artworks. Rarible enables community-governed creation and trading of NFTs.

Social and metaverse dApps use NFTs to represent digital identity, social status or ownership within virtual worlds. These platforms aim to create immersive digital experiences where users can interact, socialize and engage in various activities using NFT-based assets.

The Sandbox has sold virtual land parcels, allowing users to create and monetize experiences. Decentraland hosts virtual events and allows users to buy and develop digital real estate. Somnium Space offers a VR-compatible metaverse where users own and trade virtual properties. Cryptovoxels provides a blockchain-based world where users can build and showcase art galleries or stores.

When a user wants to create an NFT, they interact with the dApp's interface to upload their digital asset and set its properties. The dApp then communicates with a smart contract on the blockchain, which mints the NFT by generating a unique token ID and linking it to the asset's data.

For selling or buying NFTs, users browse the dApp's marketplace and initiate transactions through the interface. The dApp relays these commands to smart contracts, which handle the transfer of ownership and any associated cryptocurrency payments. Throughout this process, the blockchain records all transactions, ensuring a transparent and secure history of ownership for each NFT.

NFT dApps are built on blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, with Ethereum being the most widely used. These platforms provide the infrastructure for creating and managing unique digital assets. The blockchain's distributed ledger records every NFT transaction, maintaining a transparent and unchangeable ownership history.

Many NFT dApps use decentralized storage solutions like InterPlanetary File System to store NFT-associated content. This approach enhances digital asset longevity and accessibility by reducing dependence on centralized servers. The combination of blockchain for transaction processing and decentralized storage for content creates a strong system for NFT management and trading.

Smart contracts are self-executing programs on the blockchain that automate NFT processes. For NFTs, these contracts define token properties, including uniqueness, ownership rights and metadata. When a user mints an NFT, the smart contract generates a unique token ID and links it to the specified digital content.

In NFT transactions, smart contracts handle ownership transfers and payments. They can also implement royalty systems, automatically allocating a percentage of secondary sales to the original creator. This automation ensures that NFT sales and transfers execute exactly as programmed, without intermediaries.

NFT dApp interfaces typically feature galleries for browsing assets, tools for minting NFTs, and marketplaces for buying and selling. Users interact with these features through web or mobile applications. To use an NFT dApp, users must connect a blockchain wallet like MetaMask, which stores their digital assets and signs transactions.

The dApp communicates with the user's wallet to authorize actions on the blockchain. When a user mints, buys or sells an NFT, the interface prompts them to approve the transaction through their wallet. This process ensures secure interaction with the blockchain while maintaining a user-friendly experience. Some dApps also offer additional features like bidding systems, royalty management and collection tools.

NFT dApps provide a way to create, buy, sell and own unique digital items without centralized authorities. These applications enable direct creator-to-consumer sales, automate royalty payments and offer verifiable scarcity for digital goods. NFT dApps are reshaping how we value and interact with digital content across industries, from art and collectibles to gaming and virtual real estate.

NFT dApps distribute data across a network of nodes, eliminating points of failure. This decentralization makes system compromise difficult. Blockchain's cryptographic techniques ensure transaction immutability, preventing alterations or deletions of NFT ownership records. Public verification of transactions on the blockchain enhances trust and transparency.

Each NFT has a unique blockchain identifier, creating an unambiguous ownership record. Users can trace an NFT's provenance from creation through all ownership transfers. This feature prevents fraud and adds value by providing verifiable history. It's particularly useful in industries prone to counterfeiting, such as art and collectibles.

Creators can tokenize and sell their work directly to audiences without intermediaries, often resulting in higher profits. Many NFT dApps implement automatic royalty systems, allocating a percentage of secondary sales to the original creator. This feature enables ongoing revenue from appreciating work. Smart contracts ensure fair compensation by programming these royalties into the NFT itself.

NFT standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 enable asset interoperability across different platforms. Users can transfer NFTs between compatible dApps, increasing utility and liquidity. This feature allows for cross-platform gameplay in gaming dApps and multi-marketplace trading for art NFTs, expanding the ecosystem for digital assets.

Smart contracts enable programmable NFTs with dynamic properties and behaviors. These can include evolving artwork, interactive game items or NFTs that respond to external data feeds. Programmability allows for complex royalty structures, time-based features and conditional transfers, enhancing NFT utility and value propositions.

Some NFT dApps support fractional ownership, allowing multiple users to own shares of high-value NFTs. This feature democratizes access to expensive digital assets. Fractional ownership also increases liquidity for high-value NFTs and allows for new investment strategies in digital collectibles.

As with any emerging technology, NFT dApps face a range of challenges and risks. These issues require time to resolve or find an appropriate balance. The NFT ecosystem is facing technical limitations, security vulnerabilities, market instabilities and legal uncertainties. Developers, users and regulators are working to address these challenges and establish best practices.

Ethereum, hosting most NFT dApps, processes a limited number of transactions per second. During peak times, high gas fees make small transactions impractical. Layer-2 solutions like Polygon aim to increase transaction speed, but adoption remains limited.

Alternative chains like Solana offer faster transaction processing but face criticism for reduced decentralization. The blockchain trilemma forces trade-offs between decentralization, security and speed.

Smart contract exploits have resulted in significant losses. The Ronin Network hack in March 2022 led to a $620 million theft. In 2021, the Poly Network breach saw over $600 million stolen, though later returned.

Monthly trading volume on OpenSea dropped from $641 million in February 2023 to $32 million in August 2024. This volatility affects creator income and investor returns, with many NFTs losing significant value post-minting.

NFTs operate in a legal gray area. Different jurisdictions classify NFTs differently, leading to inconsistent treatment. The U.S. SEC has not provided clear guidance on whether NFTs are securities, creating uncertainty for issuers and platforms.

In 2022, the first NFT insider trading case was brought against a former OpenSea employee, highlighting the need for clearer regulations and enforcement in the NFT space.

NFT minting of copyrighted material without permission is widespread. In 2022, DeviantArt detected over 245,000 instances of NFT art theft on its platform alone. This creates legal risks for both creators and buyers of unauthorized NFTs.

The relationship between NFT ownership and copyright remains unclear. Purchasing an NFT typically doesn't transfer copyright of the underlying work, leading to potential disputes over usage rights.

The future of NFT dApps is likely to see increased integration with real-world assets and industries. We can expect a shift towards more utility-focused NFTs, moving beyond digital art to represent real estate, intellectual property rights and identity verification.

Improvements in blockchain scalability and interoperability will likely enhance NFT dApp functionality. Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and the development of layer-2 solutions promise to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput. Cross-chain NFT platforms may enable seamless NFT transfers across different blockchains, expanding market liquidity and user options.

The metaverse concept is expected to drive significant growth in NFT dApps. Major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft are investing heavily in virtual worlds where NFTs could represent digital land, avatars and in-world items. Gaming industry leaders such as Ubisoft and Square Enix have also announced plans to incorporate NFTs, potentially bringing blockchain-based digital ownership to mainstream gaming audiences.

NFT dApps are changing how digital assets are created, owned and traded. These applications enable direct creator-to-consumer sales, automate royalty payments and provide verifiable scarcity for digital goods. They're reshaping industries from art and gaming to real estate and identity verification.

Challenges remain, including technical limitations, market volatility and legal uncertainties. However, as solutions emerge and adoption grows, NFT dApps are likely to become an integral part of the digital asset ecosystem, offering new ways to monetize creativity and redefine digital ownership.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66ccc7df714cb76343bf28f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,0.2
How to Start Trading Bitcoin and Gold for Maximum Returns?,https://tradebrains.in/how-to-start-trading-bitcoin-and-gold-for-maximum-returns/,2024-08-26,Trade Brains,"Are you looking to diversify your investment portfolio with new opportunities? As more people explore options beyond traditional assets, such as Forex, stocks, and gold, cryptocurrency has become a popular choice. With the user penetration rate of cryptocurrency expected to rise from 18.78% in 2024 to 22.20% by 2028*, it's clear that many are eager to dive into this exciting field. If you're new to crypto, it's essential to understand that, like any investment, it comes with its own set of risks.

This beginner's guide will break down what cryptocurrencies are, the different types available, and what to consider before making an investment. Plus, you'll get a simple step-by-step guide to help you start your journey into the world of crypto with confidence.

Similarly, precious metals like gold and silver have long been valued as investment assets. Known for their stability and historical significance, these metals remain a cornerstone in many investment portfolios. Trading in precious metals, much like in cryptocurrencies, involves understanding market dynamics and the risks involved. Whether through direct purchases, futures, options, or ETFs, investing in gold and silver offers a tangible and traditional counterbalance to the digital nature of cryptocurrencies.

This guide will also touch on how you can invest in these metals, helping you diversify your investment approach in both digital and physical assets.

A cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that operates without the control of any central authority, like a government or bank. Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by a central institution. Instead, they work through a decentralized network of users online. These digital ""coins"" or ""tokens"" are protected by encryption and use a technology called blockchain to keep transactions secure.

You can use cryptocurrencies to buy things online, though fewer merchants accept them compared to regular currencies. When you make a crypto payment, a network of computers checks the transaction to ensure it's valid before processing it.

Blockchain acts as a public ledger that records all transactions. After a transaction is verified, the recipient can access their funds using a private key, which is a secret code. Many people invest in cryptocurrencies, hoping their value will increase over time, similar to how they might invest in stocks or gold.

A platform like XM is great for trading in crypto CFDs like BTCUSD (Bitcoin) and ETHUSD (Ethereum). Facilitated by several advantages, they allow you to trade 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with zero commissions and leverage up to 500:1. Whether you're going short or long, XM offers tight spreads and no re-quotes, making it an attractive investment alternative besides Forex.

Overall, cryptocurrencies offer both a new way to spend money and a potential investment opportunity, though they can be quite volatile and involve certain risks.

Precious metals are not just valuable for jewelry or as a store of wealth; they also have important industrial applications. The four main precious metals traded are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, each with unique uses and benefits across various industries.

Trading precious metals on XM offers distinct benefits. You can trade gold and silver online with no re-quotes and leverage up to 1000:1. XM also provides zero-swap Ultra Low Standard/Ultra Low Micro accounts and the flexibility to go short or long using the same account, all without extra fees.

Cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that use blockchain technology for secure transactions. As of May 2024, there are over 2.4 million cryptocurrencies*. Bitcoin, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, is the most well-known and first cryptocurrency, operating on a blockchain with a proof-of-work system. Its value has surged to over $60,000 per coin in 2024*.

Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, launched in 2015, supports decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, making it a significant player in the blockchain space. Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, minimizing volatility and appealing to cautious investors.

Solana (SOL) is known for its support of decentralized finance (DeFi) and uses a unique proof-of-stake and proof-of-history method for fast transactions. Binance Coin (BNB) is used primarily for trading and fee payments on the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.

A platform like XM helps investors understand these distinct features and use cases, so that they can make a more informed decision. Their Research & Education center offers daily updates on everything happening in the world of trading.

Before investing in cryptocurrencies, it's essential to do thorough research and consider several key factors:

Trading in precious metals like gold can be done through various methods, each with its own advantages and considerations. Here's a simple guide to some common ways to trade in these valuable assets:

Invest in precious metals through mining company stocks or mutual funds. Mining stocks generally reflect the metal prices, while mutual funds are managed by professionals, reducing individual research needs.

Futures and options:

These advanced tools allow significant bets on metal price movements with high leverage. They offer liquidity but come with substantial risk, making them suitable only for experienced investors.

Bullion:

Buying physical bullion, such as gold bars or coins, involves direct ownership. This method requires secure storage and is more suited for long-term investors due to its illiquidity.

Certificates:

Certificates represent ownership of gold stored by a third party. While they simplify ownership without physical storage, they may lack value in extreme situations.

When deciding how much to invest in cryptocurrencies, it's important to approach it with caution and strategic planning.

Limit your exposure:

Financial experts often suggest investing only 1% to 5% of your net worth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This conservative approach helps to limit potential losses, given the volatile nature of the market. It's crucial to never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Consider your overall portfolio:

Your investment in crypto, including BTC/USD should be part of a diversified portfolio. While a small exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can potentially enhance your portfolio's risk-adjusted returns, the exact amount should align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Diversify within crypto:

Just as with traditional investments, diversification is key. This means spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies, as some may have better long-term potential or be less susceptible to market manipulation. Larger, more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are generally considered to be less risky than smaller, less-known coins, but all crypto investments carry significant risk.

Monitor and adjust:

The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin and BTC/USD can be highly unpredictable, with even major coins experiencing significant price fluctuations. Regularly review your investments and be prepared to adjust your holdings as needed to maintain a balance that suits your financial goals and risk tolerance.

When investing in cryptocurrencies, securing your assets is crucial due to the risks of theft and hacking. Here are some ways to enhance your security:

Hot wallets: These are online wallets that store your crypto on internet-connected devices like phones or computers. While convenient for quick access, they are more vulnerable to hacking.

Cold wallets: These offline storage options, like USB drives or hardware wallets, are much more secure since they are not connected to the internet. However, losing the device or forgetting the access code can result in permanent loss of your crypto.

Use reputable platforms: Only use well-known and reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallet providers. This reduces the risk of falling victim to scams or insecure services.

Enhance security measures: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding 2FA provides an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your account. Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts and change them regularly.

Be vigilant against phishing scams: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or emails asking for your personal information or login credentials. Always verify the authenticity of such communications.

Never share your access information: Keep your passwords and key codes private. Sharing this information can compromise the security of your crypto assets.

By taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of losing your investment to cyber threats.

Potential for high returns:

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have delivered significant gains for investors in their relatively short history. This potential for high returns is one of the main attractions of investing in cryptocurrencies.

Decentralization:

Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central authorities, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network. This means they are not subject to government regulations or monetary policies, which can offer a level of independence from traditional financial systems.

Diversification:

Cryptocurrencies can diversify an investment portfolio. They have been compared to assets like gold, as both are seen as stores of value not controlled by any central authority. This makes them a potential hedge against inflation or market instability.

Transparency and security:

The blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies offers a transparent and secure way of recording transactions. It's difficult to alter or hack these records, which adds a layer of security to crypto transactions.

Volatility:

Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, experiencing significant price swings that can be unpredictable. This volatility can lead to substantial losses, making crypto a risky investment for those who can't handle such fluctuations.

Security risks:

While the blockchain itself is secure, individual investors are vulnerable to hacking and scams. This is especially true if they do not take proper precautions to protect their digital wallets.

Lack of regulation:

The cryptocurrency market is not as regulated as traditional financial markets. This lack of oversight can lead to risks, such as fraud, and means there is less legal protection for investors in the event of disputes or losses.

Uncertain future:

The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, both in terms of regulatory developments and market acceptance. While some see it as a transformative financial technology, others caution against its potential downsides and the possibility of substantial financial loss.

What are the risks and benefits of trading in precious metals?

Inflation protection

Precious metals like gold are known for their ability to protect against inflation. Unlike paper money, they have intrinsic value and cannot be produced at will. This makes them a reliable store of value when the cost of living rises.

Intrinsic value

Precious metals carry inherent value, which means they are worth something even without any additional economic context. This contrasts with assets like stocks, which depend on the financial health of companies.

No credit risk

Investing in precious metals doesn't involve credit risk. You don't need to worry about the solvency of an issuer or a company, which is a common concern with other types of investments.

Portfolio diversification

Adding precious metals to your investment portfolio can reduce overall risk and volatility. They often have a low or negative correlation with other asset classes like stocks and bonds, which helps balance your investment risk.

Safe haven

During times of economic or political instability, precious metals are often seen as safe havens. For instance, gold tends to rise in value during times of crisis or financial uncertainty.

Liquidity

Precious metals, particularly gold, are highly liquid. They can be easily bought and sold, making them accessible to most investors.

Price volatility

Precious metal prices can be highly volatile. Factors like changes in supply and demand, geopolitical issues, and market sentiment can cause significant price swings.

No income generation

Unlike stocks or bonds, precious metals do not produce income. You won't receive dividends or interest, which can be a downside for income-focused investors.

Storage costs

If you hold physical precious metals, you need to consider storage costs. Safeguarding gold or silver can require secure storage solutions, which can be expensive.

Supply and demand fluctuations

The value of precious metals can be affected by supply and demand imbalances. For example, if there's a disruption in mining or a technological advancement that increases production, prices might fluctuate.

Economic and political factors

Precious metals are influenced by economic and political events. For instance, changes in the value of the dollar or interest rates can impact metal prices. Additionally, while they are seen as safe havens, they are not immune to price drops due to market dynamics.

Industrial demand variability

Metals like silver and platinum have significant industrial uses. Changes in technology or manufacturing trends can affect their demand, leading to price variability.

In summary, while trading in precious metals like gold offers benefits such as protection against inflation and a reliable store of value, it also comes with risks like price volatility and no income generation. Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions about including precious metals in your investment strategy.

Investing can be challenging, whether you're exploring cryptocurrencies or precious metals. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer high returns and decentralization but come with risks like volatility and security issues. Precious metals, such as gold, provide stability, inflation protection, and a safe haven in uncertainty but involve risks like price fluctuations and storage costs. To make informed decisions, understand each asset class's fundamentals and assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.

A platform like XM helps you achieve this with its diverse range of research and educational content. Balancing your portfolio with both digital and physical assets allows you to leverage their strengths while mitigating risks.",https://tradebrains.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/How-to-Start-Trading-Bitcoin.jpg,0.4431372549019608

Bitcoin has made significant strides in the world of online casinos, and its popularity continues to rise. With the advent of Bitcoin, players can enjoy fast, secure, and anonymous transactions, making it an attractive option for online blackjack enthusiasts.

Over the past few years, Bitcoin has gained traction in the online gambling industry. More and more online casinos are starting to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, revolutionizing the way players fund their accounts and withdraw their winnings.

Bitcoin's rise in popularity can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the currency, making it immune to government interference and regulation. This decentralized nature also means that transactions can be processed faster, without the need for intermediaries such as banks.

Another reason for Bitcoin's popularity in online casinos is its security features. Bitcoin transactions are secured using advanced cryptographic techniques, making it virtually impossible for hackers to manipulate or steal funds. This provides players with peace of mind, knowing that their financial information is safe and secure.

Bitcoin offers players the benefit of anonymity. Traditional payment methods often require players to provide personal information, such as their name, address, and credit card details. With Bitcoin, however, players can make transactions without revealing any personal information, ensuring their privacy is protected.

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography for security. When it comes to online gambling, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks, ensuring privacy and secure transactions for players.

When a player uses Bitcoin to gamble online, their transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. This ledger is decentralized and maintained by a network of computers, known as nodes, spread across the globe. Each transaction is verified by these nodes, ensuring its validity and preventing fraud.

One of the key advantages of using cryptocurrencies in online gambling is the speed of transactions. Traditional payment methods often involve lengthy processing times, with withdrawals taking several days to complete. With Bitcoin, however, transactions are processed almost instantly, allowing players to access their winnings quickly.

In addition to speed, cryptocurrencies also offer lower transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods. This is because cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as banks, which often charge fees for their services. With Bitcoin, players can enjoy lower transaction costs, maximizing their winnings.

Cryptocurrencies provide players with a level of transparency that is unparalleled in traditional gambling. The blockchain technology used by cryptocurrencies allows players to verify the fairness of games and the integrity of the casino. This transparency builds trust between players and online casinos, ensuring a fair and enjoyable gambling experience.

With the rising popularity of Bitcoin, more and more blackjack sites are now accepting this cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for players who want to enjoy their favorite card game while taking advantage of the benefits that Bitcoin offers.

However, with so many options available, it can be overwhelming to pick the right blackjack site that suits your needs. To help you make an informed decision, here are some key features to consider:

When choosing a Bitcoin blackjack site, there are several factors that you should take into account.

While Bitcoin offers enhanced security compared to traditional payment methods, it's still crucial to take precautions when playing online blackjack with cryptocurrencies. Here are some safety measures to keep in mind:

By considering these key features and safety measures, you can choose the right Bitcoin blackjack site that not only provides an enjoyable gaming experience but also ensures the security of your funds and personal information.

If you're new to using Bitcoin for online blackjack, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

The first step is to set up a Bitcoin wallet, which will serve as your digital wallet for storing, sending, and receiving Bitcoin. You can choose from various types of wallets, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and online wallets.

When setting up a software wallet, you will need to download and install the wallet software on your computer or mobile device. This software will generate a unique Bitcoin address for you, which you can use to receive funds. It is important to keep your wallet software updated and secure to protect your Bitcoin.

Hardware wallets, on the other hand, are physical devices that store your Bitcoin offline. They offer enhanced security as they are not connected to the internet, making them less vulnerable to hacking attempts. To use a hardware wallet, you will need to connect it to your computer or mobile device when making transactions.

Online wallets are web-based services that allow you to store and manage your Bitcoin through a website. These wallets are convenient as you can access them from any device with an internet connection. However, it is crucial to choose a reputable online wallet provider to ensure the safety of your funds.

Once you have a Bitcoin wallet, you need to fund it with Bitcoin. To deposit Bitcoin on a blackjack site, you will be provided with a unique address where you can send your Bitcoin. This address acts as a destination for your funds and ensures that they are credited to your account correctly.

When depositing Bitcoin, you will need to initiate a transaction from your wallet software or online wallet. You will enter the blackjack site's unique address as the recipient and specify the amount of Bitcoin you want to send. After confirming the transaction, the Bitcoin network will process it, and the funds will be credited to your account on the blackjack site.

Withdrawing Bitcoin from a blackjack site follows a similar process. You will need to provide your Bitcoin wallet address to the site, which will serve as the destination for your funds. After initiating the withdrawal request, the blackjack site will process the transaction and send the Bitcoin to your wallet.

It is important to note that Bitcoin transactions are usually processed on the blockchain, which can take some time depending on network congestion. The transaction fees associated with Bitcoin transfers may also vary, so it's essential to consider these factors when depositing or withdrawing Bitcoin on blackjack sites.

Using Bitcoin for online blackjack offers several advantages, including faster transactions, lower fees, and enhanced privacy. Additionally, Bitcoin transactions are secure and transparent, thanks to the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology that powers it.

Now that you have a better understanding of the process of using Bitcoin for online blackjack, you can enjoy the convenience and benefits that this digital currency brings to the world of online gambling.

Using Bitcoin for online blackjack has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore them:

Bitcoin offers several advantages for online blackjack players. These include anonymity, faster transactions, lower fees compared to traditional banking methods, and the ability to play from anywhere in the world without geographical restrictions.

Anonymity is a key benefit of using Bitcoin on blackjack sites. Unlike traditional banking methods, Bitcoin transactions do not require personal information, allowing players to maintain their privacy. This is particularly appealing for those who value their anonymity and want to keep their gambling activities discreet.

Bitcoin transactions are known for their speed. When using traditional banking methods, deposits and withdrawals can take several days to process. However, with Bitcoin, transactions are typically completed within minutes, allowing players to enjoy their winnings or start playing without delay.

Lower fees are another advantage of using Bitcoin for online blackjack. Traditional banking methods often charge high transaction fees, especially for international transfers. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, have significantly lower fees, making it a cost-effective option for players who frequently deposit or withdraw funds from their blackjack accounts.

Furthermore, Bitcoin allows players to access online blackjack sites from anywhere in the world. Unlike traditional banking methods that may have geographical restrictions or require additional verification steps, Bitcoin enables players to bypass these limitations and enjoy their favorite blackjack games without any hassle.

Despite its advantages, Bitcoin also comes with potential risks. One of the main concerns is the volatility of Bitcoin prices, which can affect the value of your winnings. Bitcoin is known for its price fluctuations, and if the value of Bitcoin drops significantly after a win, the actual value of your winnings may decrease. This can be a source of frustration for players who prefer stable currencies.

Additionally, not all blackjack sites accept Bitcoin as a payment method. While the popularity of Bitcoin has grown in recent years, there are still some online casinos and blackjack sites that do not support this cryptocurrency. This limitation can restrict the options available to players who prefer to use Bitcoin for their online gambling activities.

It is important for players to carefully consider these potential drawbacks and risks before deciding to use Bitcoin on blackjack sites. While the benefits can be enticing, it is essential to weigh them against the potential challenges and limitations that may arise.

A: Some major benefits include anonymity, faster transaction speeds, lower fees compared to traditional banking methods, no geographical restrictions, and more privacy. Bitcoin allows blackjack players to remain anonymous and withdraw/deposit funds much quicker without high transaction fees.

A: No, Bitcoin is not yet universally accepted on all online blackjack sites. While its popularity has grown substantially, there are still some online casinos and blackjack sites that do not yet support Bitcoin payments and transactions.

A: Drawbacks and risks include volatility in Bitcoin's value, which means the actual dollar value of your winnings could fluctuate. Additionally, limited acceptance among gambling sites restricts options for players wanting to use Bitcoin. There is also a learning curve for players less familiar with cryptocurrencies.

A: One major advantage of Bitcoin is faster transaction speeds. Whereas bank transfers or credit card deposits can take days to process, Bitcoin transactions typically are completed within minutes on blackjack sites. This allows faster access to winnings.

A: One benefit of Bitcoin is users do not have to provide personal/banking information, allowing them to maintain their privacy and remain anonymous. Players should ensure the site is reputable and licensed, but do not need to supply personal info.

A: Yes, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows for anonymous gambling since transactions do not require submitting personal information. Players can maintain discretion without supplying private details.

A: Yes, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to handle transactions. Popular options include software wallets, hardware wallets, and online web-based wallets. You use your wallet address to transfer Bitcoin to/from blackjack sites.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crypto-blackjack-casinos.jpg,0.6392156862745098

A crypto lottery is a modern twist on traditional lotteries, allowing participants to buy tickets using cryptocurrency.

This type of lottery harnesses blockchain technology for transparency and security.

Winners are determined through random selection, similar to traditional lottery systems.

Unlike conventional lotteries, which often involve centralized organizations, crypto lotteries operate on decentralized platforms, making them accessible to a global audience.

This means that anyone with an internet connection and a digital wallet can participate, breaking down geographical barriers and democratizing the lottery experience.

In a crypto lottery, players purchase tickets with digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Each ticket has a unique identification associated with it on the blockchain.

The drawing occurs live, ensuring fairness by using cryptographic methods.

Many crypto lotteries incorporate smart contracts, which automatically execute the terms of the lottery without the need for intermediaries. This not only enhances trust among participants but also reduces the operational costs typically associated with running a lottery.

The use of blockchain technology allows for real-time tracking of ticket sales and prize distributions, providing participants with a level of transparency that is often lacking in traditional lottery systems.

One of the main attractions of crypto lotteries is the level of anonymity they provide. Players can participate without revealing personal information. This feature protects privacy and limits the risk of identity theft.

The use of blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and immutable, adding an extra layer of trust for participants.

Unlike traditional lotteries, where players may have to share sensitive data, crypto lotteries allow individuals to engage in gaming activities without the fear of their information being misused or sold to third parties. This aspect is particularly appealing to those who value their privacy in an increasingly digital world.

Crypto lotteries can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

There are no geographical restrictions, which means more people can participate.

This opens up the gaming opportunity to individuals in regions where traditional lotteries may not operate.

The ability to use cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange eliminates the need for currency conversion, making it easier for players from different countries to join in.

This democratization of access not only enhances the player base but also fosters a diverse community of lottery enthusiasts who can share experiences and strategies across borders. As a result, players can enjoy a richer gaming environment that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.

The operational costs for crypto lotteries are often lower than those of traditional lotteries.

As a result, players can enjoy higher payout percentages.

Lower fees mean more money goes back to participants instead of administration costs.

This financial efficiency is largely due to the reduced overhead associated with running a decentralized platform. Without the need for physical locations, staffing, and extensive regulatory compliance, crypto lotteries can allocate a greater portion of their revenue directly to winners.

Many crypto lotteries utilize smart contracts to automate payouts, ensuring that winnings are distributed quickly and transparently, further enhancing player trust and satisfaction.

This innovative approach not only benefits players but also encourages more frequent participation, as individuals are drawn to the prospect of better odds and greater rewards.

Before investing in any crypto lottery, it's crucial to check the site's reputation.

Look for reviews and feedback from other players to gauge their experiences.

A reliable platform often has a history of payouts and customer satisfaction.

Consider the longevity of the site in the market; established platforms tend to have a proven track record and a loyal user base. Engaging with community forums or social media groups dedicated to crypto lotteries can also provide insights into the site's credibility.

Players often share their success stories and warnings about potential scams, which can be invaluable in making an informed choice.

The security of your funds and personal information is paramount in online gaming.

Choose platforms that use strong encryption and secure wallets.

Investigation into the site's licensing and regulatory compliance also adds protection.

Look for two-factor authentication (2FA) options, which provide an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification before allowing access to your account.

Reputable sites often conduct regular security audits and provide transparency about their security protocols. Checking if they have a dedicated customer support team available to address any security concerns can also be a good indicator of their commitment to protecting users.

Every lottery site will have its own set of rules and regulations.

Make sure to read and understand them fully before purchasing tickets.

This can help avoid misunderstandings about the withdrawal process or payout structure.

Familiarize yourself with the specific terms regarding jackpot sizes, ticket prices, and any associated fees that may apply. Some platforms may offer different types of lotteries, each with unique rules, so understanding these nuances can enhance your gaming experience.

It's wise to keep an eye on any promotional offers or changes in regulations that could impact your participation, as these can vary significantly between sites and over time.

By taking all these factors into consideration, we were able to select the best crypto lotteries that provide a safe and enjoyable gambling experience for players.

To buy a ticket, start by selecting a reputable crypto lottery site. Look for platforms that are well-reviewed and have a transparent operation, ensuring your funds are secure.

Next, create an account and fund it with your chosen cryptocurrency. Most sites accept popular currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, but be sure to check the specific requirements of the platform you choose.

Navigate to the lottery section, select your numbers or a quick pick, and complete the purchase. Some platforms may offer additional features, such as the ability to buy tickets for multiple draws in advance or to set up recurring entries for your favorite lotteries. This can save you time and ensure you never miss a chance to win.

No lottery guarantees a win, but certain strategies can improve your odds. One effective method is to study past winning numbers, as some players believe that certain numbers appear more frequently than others. While this is not a foolproof strategy, it can add an element of fun to your number selection process.

Consider joining a syndicate to pool tickets and increase collective chances. This approach allows you to share the cost of multiple tickets with a group of friends or fellow players, significantly boosting your odds of winning without breaking the bank.

Regular participation can also help you recognize patterns, although lotteries are fundamentally random. Engaging with a community of lottery enthusiasts can provide insights and tips that you might not discover on your own, enhancing your overall experience in the crypto lottery world.

Crypto lottery sites represent the future of online lottery gaming, offering a blend of innovation, security, and accessibility.

By choosing one of the best crypto lottery platforms, you're not only embracing cutting-edge technology but also potentially enhancing your chances of winning.

Remember to consider factors such as game variety, token compatibility, user interface, and community feedback when selecting your preferred site.

As the crypto lottery landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and choosing reputable platforms will ensure you make the most of your digital lottery experience.

Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the world of crypto lotteries, these top sites provide exciting opportunities to test your luck in the digital age.

Crypto lottery sites operate similarly to traditional online lotteries but use cryptocurrencies for transactions. Players purchase tickets using supported cryptocurrencies, and draws are typically conducted using provably fair algorithms or blockchain-based random number generators. Winnings are distributed in cryptocurrency, often with faster payout times compared to traditional lotteries.

The accepted cryptocurrencies vary by platform, but most popular crypto lottery sites support Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Many also accept other major cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and various stablecoins. Some sites may even have their own native tokens for gameplay.

The legality of crypto lottery sites depends on your jurisdiction. Many operate in a legal grey area due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. It's essential to check your local laws and regulations regarding online gambling and cryptocurrency use before participating.

Reputable crypto lottery sites use provably fair algorithms or blockchain technology to ensure randomness and transparency. Look for sites that publicly display their algorithms, provide verifiable draw results, and have their systems audited by third-party organizations.

Crypto lottery sites often offer advantages such as increased privacy, faster payouts, lower fees, global accessibility, and potentially better odds. They also provide transparency through blockchain technology and may offer unique games not found in traditional lotteries.

To deposit, you typically need to transfer cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the site's designated address. Withdrawals usually involve requesting a payout to your crypto wallet address. The process is generally faster than traditional banking methods, often completing within minutes or hours.

While most crypto lottery sites don't charge fees for playing, you may incur transaction fees when depositing or withdrawing cryptocurrencies. These fees are typically lower than those associated with traditional payment methods.

Crypto lottery sites generally offer a higher degree of anonymity compared to traditional lotteries. Many only require an email address or username to create an account. However, some sites may require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for large withdrawals or to comply with regulations.

Crypto lottery sites often offer a variety of games beyond traditional number draws. These may include instant win games, scratch cards, slot-like games, and even lottery pools. Some sites also feature unique blockchain-based games that leverage smart contracts.

Jackpots on crypto lottery sites can be fixed amounts of cryptocurrency or progressive jackpots that grow with each ticket sold. Some sites offer massive jackpots comparable to traditional national lotteries, while others focus on smaller, more frequent wins.",https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Best-Bitcoin-Crypto-Lottery-Sites.jpg,0.4745098039215687
"Ethereum price today: ETH is trading at $2,389.66",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-06-2024/,2024-09-06,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, was $2,389.66 as of 8 a.m. ET. The crypto's highest intraday price in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $285.58 billion. ETH is currently up 47% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $285.58 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 71% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $76.11 billion, XRP at $53.84 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.14 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $285.58 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $303 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,389.66.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 118% and ETH is up 47% year over year.

How to buy ethereum

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to safely store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.09019607843137245
Is Crypto Serious or Just a Casino? Examining Investment Risks and Market Behavior,https://coinpaper.com/5136/is-crypto-serious-or-just-a-casino-examining-investment-risks-and-market-behavior,2024-08-19,Coinpaper,"Cryptocurrency has sparked countless debates, with some viewing it as a groundbreaking investment and others considering it nothing more than a high-stakes gamble. Many experts argue that its volatile nature and potential for high returns make it both a serious investment and a casino-like risk. As we move through 2024, discussions around the true nature of crypto continue to heat up, reflecting the market's complex dynamics.

Some crypto enthusiasts on Twitter praise the industry for its potential to revolutionize financial systems worldwide. Influencers like Vitalik Buterin emphasize how platforms like Ethereum offer more than just currency, enabling decentralized applications that could change industries. However, many also voice concerns about the speculative nature of crypto trading, which can resemble gambling more than traditional investing.

The recent volatile market behaviors have only added to the confusion. While some praise crypto's potential for robust returns, recent tweets from market analysts highlight its significant risks. Is crypto a severe investment or just a casino? The answer depends on one's perspective and risk tolerance. Understanding both viewpoints is essential for anyone considering stepping into this volatile market.

Cryptocurrency offers a new form of digital currency that uses blockchain technology for security and decentralization. This innovation has transformed how we think about money, providing transparency and privacy like never before.

Digital currency is money that exists only in digital form. It is not tangible, like paper money or coins. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It introduced a peer-to-peer network that does not require a central authority, such as a bank.

Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies. Each transaction is recorded in a digital ledger of blocks, which are then linked together in a chain. This structure ensures all transactions are transparent and immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once recorded. Blockchain's decentralized nature, where no single entity controls the entire network, makes it secure and resistant to fraud.

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available today. Bitcoin was the first and remains the most well-known and widely used. Other significant cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts, allowing for complex transactions beyond simple currency exchange.

Ripple (XRP) is another popular digital currency designed mainly for banking and financial institutions to facilitate low-cost, high-speed international payments. Litecoin, often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, offers faster transaction times and lower fees. Additionally, privacy-focused coins like Monero and Zcash provide enhanced anonymity for users.

These diverse types of cryptocurrencies offer various functionalities, from basic transactions to complex financial services, illustrating the wide-ranging potential of blockchain technology in different sectors.

Cryptocurrency can be an investment opportunity with diverse strategies, detailed market analysis, and transparent risk vs. reward ratios. These aspects must be considered to understand the seriousness of cryptocurrency in investment.

Investors approach cryptocurrencies with a range of strategies. One standard method is buy-and-hold. This long-term strategy involves purchasing and holding onto a cryptocurrency, anticipating its value will increase substantially over time.

Another key strategy is diversification. By spreading investments across various cryptocurrencies, investors can mitigate risks associated with market volatility.

Staking is also a popular method. It involves holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency to support blockchain operations earning rewards while the cryptocurrency remains in a wallet.

Market analysis is vital in crypto investments. Investors often rely on technical analysis, which involves examining historical price charts and volume trends to predict future movements. This method helps in understanding market sentiment and making informed decisions.

Fundamental analysis is another approach. It looks at a cryptocurrency's underlying technology, team, adoption rate, and use cases. This helps investors gauge the intrinsic value of a cryptocurrency beyond its market price.

Social media, particularly crypto Twitter, is crucial in market analysis. Influencers and analysts share real-time insights, news, and sentiments that can impact market behavior. Key figures in the crypto space often provide valuable information through tweets and threads.

Investing in cryptocurrency carries both risks and potential rewards. The market is highly volatile, meaning prices can swing drastically quickly. This volatility can offer high reward potential but also pose significant risks.

Security is a primary concern, and there are risks of hacks and scams. Investors must use secure wallets and exchanges to protect their assets.

Regulatory developments also impact risk. Governments worldwide are still establishing cryptocurrency regulations, which can affect market stability and investor confidence.

Despite the risks, many investors are attracted to cryptocurrencies due to their potential for high returns and the innovative technology that underpins them. Diversification and informed strategies can help balance these risks, giving investors a well-rounded approach to cryptocurrency investments.

The crypto market dynamics play a crucial role in understanding its behavior and potential. Supply and demand, market volatility, and the regulatory landscape are vital factors.

Supply and demand significantly impact cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, for example, has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which creates scarcity and affects its value. As demand increases, so does the price. Interest surged in Bitcoin casinos between 2019 and 2021, contributing to a rise in crypto market value.

Ethereum, on the other hand, has a different supply mechanism. Its total supply isn't capped, allowing more flexibility. The demand for Ethereum-based applications, like decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, also influences its price. The growing popularity of these platforms highlights the complex interaction between supply and demand.

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. This characteristic attracts investors looking for quick gains and criticism from those wary of the risks. Daily price swings can be substantial. Elon Musk's tweets have been known to cause significant fluctuations in Bitcoin and Dogecoin prices.

In 2021, Bitcoin's price nearly doubled and halved within months, illustrating extreme volatility. This volatility can be attributed to market sentiment, news events, and changes in investor behavior. Crypto Twitter often debates whether the market resembles a high-stakes casino or a severe investment landscape.

Regulation plays a pivotal role in shaping the cryptocurrency market. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate digital assets. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has increased scrutiny to protect investors and ensure market stability.

Countries like China have banned crypto transactions, impacting global markets. Conversely, nations like El Salvador have embraced Bitcoin as a legal tender, promoting its use and adoption. These diverse regulatory approaches create uncertainty that affects market behavior and investor confidence.

The ongoing debate around regulation continues to shape the future of the crypto market. Balancing innovation and protection remains a crucial challenge for policymakers.

Cryptocurrencies claim dual identities -- as a transaction medium and as speculative assets. Each function brings different uses and risks, which are dissected below.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were initially created to facilitate transactions and as an alternative to traditional currency systems. As digital currencies, they can be used to buy goods and services. Bitcoin, for instance, is the most commonly used cryptocurrency for transactions. Companies like Microsoft and Overstock accept Bitcoin payments, and more businesses are exploring this option.

Despite this, a recent study shows minimal daily transaction usage. Google's search trends indicate a waning public interest in using Bitcoin primarily as money. This limited use is partly due to high fees and slower transaction times compared to traditional payment methods.

According to Twitter discussions among crypto enthusiasts, Bitcoin's volatility is another barrier to its widespread transaction use. When BTC can lose or gain significant value within days, it's less attractive for everyday purchases.

The market often treats cryptocurrencies more as speculative assets than actual currencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies have experienced dramatic price fluctuations. Bitcoin, for example, reached a high of $60,000 in 2021 and dropped to around $30,000 in 2023, reflecting extreme market volatility.

Speculation is seen as both a feature and a challenge within the crypto world. According to MoneyGeek, many investors treat cryptocurrencies as vehicles to earn quick returns rather than stable investments. This speculative nature encourages a casino-like atmosphere, attracting those seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities.

Crypto Twitter often buzzes with debates on this issue. Influential voices discuss how speculation is driving innovation but also causing instability. A prominent analyst tweeted, ""Crypto is both the Wild West and the future of finance. Its risk is the trade-off for potentially high rewards.""

In conclusion, while cryptocurrencies hold the potential for transactional use, their current market behavior leans heavily toward speculation.

Cryptocurrency has recently seen increased legitimacy with institutional investors and the growing presence of diversified portfolios. Traditional financial strategies are finding a place in this rapidly evolving market.

Institutional adoption of cryptocurrency is gaining significant momentum. Large financial entities such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley now offer their clients access to crypto investments. BlackRock's cryptocurrency strategy includes a Bitcoin trust, signaling a serious commitment to digital assets.

Positive statements from influential financial figures further bolster confidence. For instance, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has described Bitcoin as a ""global market"" with potential for future growth. These endorsements help alleviate skepticism about cryptocurrencies as mere speculative assets.

Partnerships between crypto firms and traditional financial institutions also highlight increased acceptance. Fidelity Investments, for example, has expanded its Bitcoin assets under management. These moves indicate that large-scale investors view cryptocurrencies as viable, long-term investments rather than high-risk gambling.

Cryptocurrencies offer investors diversification opportunities. They are uncorrelated asset classes, meaning they do not necessarily move in sync with traditional stocks and bonds. This characteristic can provide a hedge against market volatility.

Notably, Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated resiliency in various market conditions. Grayscale underscores that allocating a small percentage of digital assets in diversified portfolios can improve risk-adjusted returns. Anthony Pompliano, a well-known crypto enthusiast on Twitter, echoed this, pointing out that cryptocurrencies can ""reduce risk and improve returns"" when added to traditional portfolios.

Furthermore, introducing cryptocurrency ETFs provides a more accessible entry point for investors to incorporate digital assets into their portfolios. With these products, investors can gain exposure without dealing directly with digital currencies. This development underscores the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into diverse investment strategies.

Casino gambling and crypto investments often appear similar but have distinct differences. Both involve risk and uncertainty, but their core principles and potential returns vary significantly.

Casino gambling primarily relies on chance. Games like roulette, slot machines, and blackjack are designed so that the house always has an edge. The outcomes are primarily random, making gaining an advantage through skill or strategy difficult.

Conversely, crypto investments can be more than just a gamble. Investors use tools like market analysis, technical indicators, and diversification strategies to manage risks effectively. Though highly volatile, cryptocurrency markets can be influenced by real-world events, innovations, and regulatory changes.

Market experts often debate the skills involved in crypto investing. As one prominent analyst tweeted, ""Crypto isn't just roulette; it's a volatile but manageable market if you know what you're doing."" This highlights the perception that skill and knowledge can play a role in crypto investments.

The potential returns from casino gambling are often capped and short-term. Winning big might be thrilling, but losses can accumulate fast. Since outcomes rely so heavily on luck, consistent wins are unlikely.

Crypto investments offer a range of potential returns depending on market behavior and investment strategy. Many invest in cryptocurrencies with a long-term perspective, hoping for substantial growth over time. For example, Bitcoin's value surged from a few dollars to tens of thousands over a decade, presenting high reward potential for early investors.

However, the risks cannot be ignored. The crypto market's volatility can lead to significant losses. In the words of a crypto journalist, ""It's not just about the highs. Being prepared for the lows is equally crucial."" This sentiment emphasizes the need for cautious optimism when investing in cryptocurrencies.

Investing in cryptocurrency entails significant risks, such as security breaches and potential fraud. These factors require careful consideration for those looking to enter the market.

One critical risk in the crypto world is the threat of security breaches. Since cryptocurrencies are digital, they are vulnerable to hacks and cyberattacks. Platforms like crypto exchanges and wallets are frequent targets.

Several high-profile hacks, such as the attack on Coincheck in 2018, highlight the severity of these risks. Security measures like two-factor authentication and cold storage can mitigate risks, but they are not foolproof.

Centralized exchanges are particularly prone to hacking. Twitter users often express concerns about keeping funds on exchanges. Instead, experts recommend using hardware wallets for better security. Ensuring a safe and secure trading environment is essential for protecting investments.

Fraud and scams are rampant in the crypto industry. These schemes can take various forms, such as Ponzi schemes, fake ICOs, and phishing scams. Scammers often exploit the anonymity and lack of regulation in the crypto space to target unsuspecting investors.

The 2021 crypto boom saw a spike in fraudulent activities. Scams like the infamous Bitconnect case caused substantial losses for many investors. Efforts to educate the public and regulators to crack down on these schemes can help reduce risks.

Crypto experts on Twitter stress the importance of doing thorough research before investing. Trusting unknown sources or overly promising projects can lead to significant financial losses. Awareness and caution are crucial to navigating this risky landscape.

Cryptocurrency continues to attract significant attention from investors and technology enthusiasts. As the industry matures, the coming years are expected to bring notable technological advancements and shifts in market dynamics.

Cryptocurrency's future promises substantial technological progress. One key area is the development of innovative contract technology. These advancements aim to enhance automation, fairness, and transparency in transactions. This tech could minimize fraud and increase trust among users.

Blockchain continues to evolve, enabling faster and more secure transactions. Technologies like Ethereum 2.0 aim to improve scalability and efficiency. Moreover, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms shows the growing importance of crypto in traditional financial systems.

Prominent voices on crypto Twitter, such as Vitalik Buterin, emphasize the need for sustainable and scalable solutions. This is pivotal as the industry expands. Additionally, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as zk-rollups, are set to improve transaction speeds and lower costs further.

Experts anticipate robust growth in the cryptocurrency market. Current forecasts suggest a global market valuation of around $51.5 billion in 2024, growing to $71.7 billion by 2028. These projections reflect rising adoption across various industries.

Market behaviors also highlight increased institutional interest. Large corporations and financial institutions continue to invest and explore crypto options. For instance, the continued rise in Ethereum prices, up 41.8% in 2024, signifies strong market confidence.

However, volatility remains a significant challenge. Fluctuations in cryptocurrency values can pose risks for investors. Despite this, the potential for high returns keeps attracting individuals and businesses alike. Notable analysts like Cathie Wood highlight crypto as an asset class with considerable long-term growth potential.

Cryptocurrency is the subject of lively debate about whether it is a serious investment or just a speculative game. Many in the market see it as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, while others view it as a space filled with volatility and gambling.

Many crypto enthusiasts laud its potential to revolutionize finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum's rapid gains have attracted significant interest. Quotes from popular crypto analysts often highlight the technological advancements and real-world applications of blockchain.

Crypto Twitter regularly buzzes with opinions. Elon Musk's tweets, for instance, can swing markets dramatically. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder, often discusses the technology's potential for global impact.

Investment decisions in crypto require careful thought and caution. While some see crypto as the next big financial revolution, others argue it behaves like a high-stakes casino. Financial experts like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood have staked their reputations on crypto, believing it holds significant promise.

Despite different views, cryptocurrency remains a dynamic part of modern finance. Its impact, whether as a serious investment or speculative venture, continues to unfold.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1724069407/cp6225_Bitcoin_generic_cover_v_6_1_f1bf5a37_c488_4e0b_bb5e_3ce3f660a353_4ab78a3e7f.png,0.1607843137254903
Keeping Cryptocurrency In Wallet Or In Exchange - Which Is Better?,https://www.technology.org/how-and-why/cryptocurrency-wallet-or-exchange/,2024-08-24,Technology Org,"Investing in cryptocurrencies may be a good way to earn money. However, one must take all the necessary security precautions to keep their crypto safe. Hackers, scammers, exchanges going bankrupt, lost passwords: there are many reasons why one may lose their hard-earned money. Where should you keep the money to be as safe as possible?

What is a cryptocurrency wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. While the term ""wallet"" might suggest a place where cryptocurrencies are physically stored, in reality, it doesn't store the actual coins. Instead, a cryptocurrency wallet securely stores the cryptographic keys -- private and public keys -- that are needed to access and manage your cryptocurrency holdings on the blockchain.

What is a cryptocurrency exchange?

A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies. Similar to stock exchanges where stocks and other financial instruments are traded, cryptocurrency exchanges provide a marketplace for users to exchange digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. These platforms play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing liquidity and allowing users to convert cryptocurrencies into traditional fiat currencies (like USD, EUR, etc.) and vice versa.

Crypto wallet vs. exchange: Which is better to keep your assets?

The decision between using a crypto wallet or an exchange for storing your assets depends on your priorities and how you intend to use your cryptocurrencies. Here are our recommendations:

When you buy and hold crypto, you are likely to use exchange platforms such as Kraken, Coinbase, or Crypto.com. It's crucial to choose a legitimate and secure exchange to take care of your crypto.

One way to evaluate the safety of an exchange is to look at how much of the exchange's crypto is kept in ""hot wallets"" connected to the internet. The best exchanges store most of their crypto in offline ""cold wallets."" It's also advisable to choose exchanges that reimburse users for hacks.

Another tip is to always use two-factor authentication when signing in to your exchange.

When you aren't trading your crypto actively, it's best to transfer it to a crypto wallet.

There are two types of them: hot and cold.

While hot wallets are connected to the internet and accessible on your phone or computer, cold wallets aren't connected to the internet. Hot wallets are more easily accessible and often cheaper, but less safe. Cold wallets ensure exceptional safety but are impractical for frequent use and are vulnerable to physical theft.

When you use a crypto wallet, seed words are used to generate your crypto accounts and addresses. It's important to write these words down on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place.

To put it shortly, you should keep your cryptocurrency in an exchange if you are actively trading it. When you want to store it for a longer period of time, choose a wallet. It's always necessary to be cautious and take security measures, such as choosing a reliable exchange or wallet and using a strong password.

Conclusion

Choosing between a cryptocurrency wallet and an exchange depends on your needs, security preferences, and trading habits.

For maximum security, especially for long-term holdings, using a hardware wallet is recommended.

For frequent trading and access to additional financial services, keeping some funds on a trusted exchange is practical.

In the end, diversifying storage methods and maintaining good security practices, such as using two-factor authentication (2FA) and regularly updating security software, are critically important steps to safeguarding your cryptocurrency assets.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cryptocurrency-buried-720x480.jpg,0.1058823529411765

This guide will provide you with valuable insights into the best crypto casinos in Cyprus, as well as an overview of the legal landscape surrounding crypto gambling in the country.

What is a Crypto Casino?

A crypto casino operates similarly to traditional online casinos, but instead of using fiat currencies, they accept cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

Furthermore, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies allows for greater privacy and anonymity when playing at a crypto casino. Players can enjoy their favorite games without the need to disclose personal information, providing an added layer of security and confidentiality.

Benefits of Crypto Casinos

There are several advantages to playing at a crypto casino in Cyprus. Firstly, transactions are fast and secure since cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries. Additionally, crypto casinos offer provably fair games, ensuring that the outcomes are unbiased and transparent.

Another notable benefit of crypto casinos is the global accessibility they provide. Players from different parts of the world can easily participate in gaming activities without being restricted by geographical boundaries or traditional banking systems.

Current Laws and Regulations

At present, Cyprus does not have specific laws governing crypto gambling. However, traditional online gambling regulations apply to crypto casinos operating within the country.

This means that these platforms must be licensed and regulated by the Cyprus Gaming and Casino Supervision Commission, ensuring player protection and fair gaming.

The Cyprus Gaming and Casino Supervision Commission, established to oversee the gaming industry in the country, plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of online gambling activities. By upholding stringent standards and monitoring compliance, the commission aims to safeguard the interests of both players and operators.

Future Predictions for Crypto Gambling Laws

As the crypto gambling industry continues to evolve, it is likely that Cyprus will introduce specific regulations tailored to this sector. These regulations will aim to address concerns such as money laundering and player protection, ensuring a safe and responsible gambling environment for all.

"Ethereum price today: ETH is down 1.03% today, trading at $2,326.58",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-12-2024/,2024-09-12,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site. This commission does not influence our editors' opinions or evaluations. Please view our full advertiser disclosure policy.

Ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,326.58 as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price the cryptocurrency reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $282.71 billion. It's up 45% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $282.71 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $78.80 billion, XRP at $53.74 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.88 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $282.71 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $306 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $291 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,326.58.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 122% year over year, compared to a 45% gain for ethereum.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

The signup process requires you to provide Know Your Consumer (KYC) information, including your date of birth, a photo of your driver's license and your home address. The verification process typically takes a few days to complete. Once your account is verified and created, it is crucial to securely store your login information.

2. Set Up a Wallet (Optional)

If you plan to trade HEX on a decentralized exchange, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet. The safest way to store cryptocurrency is in a self-custody crypto wallet. This keeps your digital assets out of reach from malicious third parties. Connect your wallet to the platform to swap your crypto assets securely. You can purchase Ethereum on a safe cryptocurrency exchange like Robinhood and swap it for HEX on a DEX like Uniswap.

3. Purchase HEX

Once you've connected your wallet to the DEX, select the amount of ETH you wish to exchange, choose HEX as the receiving token, and execute the trade. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to be processed on the blockchain. Once completed, the HEX tokens will appear in your crypto wallet. You can either hold them or stake them for potential gains.

HEX Overview

HEX is an ERC-20 smart contract launched on Dec. 2, 2019 as the first blockchain equivalent to the traditional certificate of deposit used by major financial institutions. A CD is a product offered by banks and other financial institutions in which the buyer agrees to place a lump-sum deposit in the control of the bank. Investors will leave their deposits untouched for a predefined number of years in exchange for an agreed-upon interest rate.

The HEX smart contract allows token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the next upcoming HEX minting. HEX's TruthEngine technology rewards users who stake larger amounts of HEX for longer periods of time and penalizes those who withdraw their tokens before the agreed-upon date. Unlike many smart contracts, the HEX smart contract has obtained two independent security reviews.

Since its launch in December 2019, HEX has seen a return on investment of over 500%. The token reached an all-time high price of $0.5561 on Nov. 16, 2021. Currently, HEX is trading for around $0.001216.

Where to Buy HEX

We recommend investing in HEX by investing in an intermediary cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum. As the largest cryptocurrencies on the market, you'll have plenty of reputable options to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum on trusted U.S.-based trading platforms. From here, you can transfer your BTC or ETH to your chosen crypto exchange, which you can then convert to HEX and transfer to a wallet. This gives you access to the tokens you want to add to your cryptocurrency wallet while also keeping your personal information safe and secure.

Currently, the best place to buy HEX is Uniswap. You will need to purchase some Ethereum to swap for HEX on Uniswap. You can buy Ethereum from Robinhood. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX), so instead of making an account, you'll need to connect a cryptocurrency wallet to the exchange. The best wallet for interacting with DEXs is MetaMask.

Now that you know how to buy HEX, you need to know how to store it safely.

If you're looking for a hardware wallet that effortlessly combines sleek design with unprecedented security, you should consider the Ellipal Titan hardware wallet. It offers a stylish design and high security for cryptocurrency investors.

Should You Add HEX to Your Portfolio?

HEX is currently the 3705th largest cryptocurrency when measured by market capitalization. This makes it a small cryptocurrency offering only available on a few select exchanges. It also means that HEX is an exceptionally volatile offering that can reach $0 at any time. If you do decide to invest in HEX (or any minor altcoin) be sure that it only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/22172717/hex.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.2941176470588236

When we talk about anonymous casinos, we refer to online gambling platforms that allow players to wager and win using cryptocurrencies while maintaining their anonymity.

These casinos prioritize user privacy and security by eliminating the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.

KYC typically requires users to provide personal information such as identification documents and proof of address.

By removing these requirements, anonymous crypto casinos offer a more private and discreet gambling experience.

What is No KYC Gambling?

No KYC gambling refers to the process of betting and playing casino games without providing personal information to the casino.

Unlike traditional online casinos that require players to verify their identity, anonymous crypto casinos allow users to remain anonymous throughout the gambling process. This means that players can enjoy their favorite casino games without worrying about their personal information being exposed or misused.

Benefits of Anonymous Gambling

There are several advantages to choosing anonymous crypto gambling over traditional online casinos. One of the main benefits is enhanced privacy.

By using cryptocurrencies, players can conduct transactions without revealing their identities, providing an additional layer of security. Additionally, anonymous crypto casinos often offer higher bonuses and better odds compared to their traditional counterparts, making them an attractive option for gamblers seeking lucrative opportunities.

Another significant advantage of anonymous crypto gambling is the global accessibility it provides. Traditional online casinos often have geographical restrictions that prevent players from certain countries from participating.

However, anonymous crypto casinos operate on a decentralized network, enabling anyone with an internet connection to join and play.

Anonymous crypto casinos have revolutionized the gambling industry by introducing provably fair gaming. This concept ensures that the outcomes of casino games are genuinely random and not manipulated by the casino.

Through the use of cryptographic algorithms, players can verify the fairness of each game and have confidence in the integrity of the platform.

In addition to provably fair gaming, anonymous crypto casinos also offer a wide variety of games to cater to different preferences. From classic table games like blackjack and roulette to innovative and immersive slot machines, players can find a game that suits their interests and provides an enjoyable and entertaining experience.

Crypto Transaction Speed and Ease

One of the significant advantages of anonymous crypto casinos is the speed and ease of cryptocurrency transactions.

Deposits and withdrawals are typically processed instantly or within a short period, thanks to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. This ensures that players can enjoy a seamless gambling experience without unnecessary delays.

Top anonymous crypto casinos often go the extra mile to offer a diverse selection of games, catering to players with varying preferences.

Evaluating Casino Reputation and Trustworthiness

Before entrusting your funds and personal information to an anonymous crypto casino, conducting a thorough evaluation of its reputation and trustworthiness is paramount.

Beyond just glancing at the surface, delve into user reviews, ratings, and feedback to glean insights into the community's experiences with the platform. Additionally, verifying that the casino holds a valid license from a respected regulatory body ensures that your gameplay is safeguarded by industry standards and regulations.

Assessing User Experience and Interface

Embarking on your gambling journey at an anonymous crypto casino should be a seamless and enjoyable experience, and the user interface plays a pivotal role in shaping this journey.

Opting for a platform with an intuitive and visually appealing interface, coupled with smooth navigation and responsive design, can enhance your overall satisfaction.

A well-crafted interface ensures that you can effortlessly navigate through the casino, access your favorite games, and manage your account with ease, fostering a hassle-free gaming environment.

Checking for Fair Gaming Practices

Central to a fulfilling gambling experience is the assurance of fair gameplay, and this is where provably fair gaming practices come into play.

By selecting an anonymous crypto casino that integrates provably fair algorithms, you can rest assured that each game's outcome is verifiable through cryptographic tools. This transparency not only instills confidence in the player but also fosters a sense of trust and accountability between the player and the casino, laying the foundation for a harmonious gaming relationship.

Ensure that you understand the transaction fees associated with these processes to avoid any surprises.

Before making any deposits, verify the casino's deposit methods and processing times.

Some casinos may require a certain number of confirmations on the blockchain before crediting your account. Withdrawal processes can vary in speed and may be subject to additional verification steps for security purposes.

Tips for Responsible Crypto Gambling

While anonymous crypto gambling offers exciting opportunities, it's essential to gamble responsibly. Set a gambling budget and stick to it, avoiding chasing losses or exceeding your financial limits.

How to Buy Cryptocurrencies in Australia?,https://usethebitcoin.com/bitcoin/buy-bitcoin-in-australia/,2024-08-15,UseTheBitcoin,"Choose a reliable crypto exchange that fits your needs. Consider factors like user-friendliness, fees, and security.

Additionally, their earn program allows users to generate attractive returns of up to 24.48% per year on their cryptocurrency holdings.

Any investor must select the proper cryptocurrency exchange. Let's focus on several key factors to ensure platforms.

Purchasing Bitcoin from someone you know is simple. Simply provide your Bitcoin wallet address to the seller. Once they send the Bitcoin to your wallet, you pay them the agreed-upon amount in cash or through a bank transfer.

Several platforms connect Bitcoin buyers and sellers. These platforms allow you to find individuals in your area willing to sell Bitcoin. You can arrange a face-to-face meeting to complete the transaction or opt for a bank transfer, although caution is advised when dealing with unknown parties. Popular platforms for this include LocalBitcoins and MyCelium Local Trader.

Bitcoin ATMs offer a convenient way to purchase Bitcoin using cash. However, these machines typically charge higher fees, often between 5% and 10% of the transaction amount. You can find Bitcoin ATM locations using services like FindBitcoinATM.

For larger purchases or to avoid the potential risks of peer-to-peer trading, consider using a regulated cryptocurrency exchange like Independent Reserve. This platform allows you to buy Bitcoin using various payment methods, including bank and electronic funds transfers.

Important Note: When dealing with individuals or platforms outside regulated exchanges, exercise caution to protect yourself from scams and potential losses.

Investing in cryptocurrencies within the Australian market presents both opportunities and risks. While the potential for substantial returns exists, it's crucial to approach the market cautiously and conduct thorough research. Prioritize security by utilizing hardware wallets and robust security measures.

Stay informed about the Australian cryptocurrency landscape, including market trends, regulations, and exchange offerings. By combining careful consideration with a solid understanding of the local market, investors can confidently navigate the Australian cryptocurrency scene.",https://usethebitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Firefly-cryptocurrency-exchanges-on-a-australia-flag-58858-1024x585.jpg,0.3647058823529412

AMP is a cryptocurrency designed to enhance the speed and security of digital transactions, particularly in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment systems. It functions as a collateral token, allowing users to lock up AMP to guarantee the value of transactions on the Flexa network, which facilitates instant payments at various retail locations without the need for intermediaries. By providing collateral, AMP helps mitigate the risk of transaction failures or price volatility, making it an appealing option for merchants and consumers alike. Its unique approach to securing payments positions AMP as a vital player in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and the push toward a more efficient digital economy.

If you're interested in learning more about AMP and adding this token to your portfolio, our beginner's guide will make investing easier.

Follow this step-by-step guide on how to buy AMP successfully.

Before you can invest in most types of cryptocurrencies, you'll need to open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or crypto broker that supports AMP. Though AMP isn't the most popular cryptocurrency on the market when compared to major offerings like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are still multiple platforms that you can use to buy, sell and convert AMP including Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com and Gemini.

Once you've selected a reputable platform, go to its website or download the mobile app, and look for an option to sign up or create an account. You'll be prompted to provide basic personal information, such as your email address and a password. After this, you may need to verify your identity by submitting personal documents like a government-issued ID and proof of address, in compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

To deposit funds into your account, go to the ""Deposit"" section. This section is typically located in your account settings or wallet area. Depending on the platform, you can deposit fiat currency like USD or EUR, or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

For fiat deposits, link your bank account or use a credit card/debit card. Follow the prompts to complete the transaction.

If you are depositing cryptocurrency, you will receive a wallet address specific to the currency you wish to deposit. Copy this address and use it in your external wallet to initiate the transfer.

Always double-check your details to avoid losing funds. Keep in mind any transaction fees and deposit times that may apply to your chosen cryptocurrency exchange.

When you've fully created and funded your account, you can place an order to buy AMP. Open the trading platform and choose the type of order that you'd like to use to buy AMP. Take a look at the current price of AMP and decide if you believe that the price will move up or down. Then, select an order type. Most brokers will provide you with a multitude of order types, but the most commonly used orders are:

Once you've decided what order type you want, place a buy order for the amount of AMP tokens you wish to purchase. Make sure that you thoroughly verify the order details prior to finalizing the transaction.

AMP is an ERC-20 token. An ERC-20 token is a project built using the Ethereum blockchain. Independent ERC-20 projects can be used to power a variety of protocols, using Ethereum's smart contract system to execute agreements according to predefined characteristics. ERC-20 tokens have the benefit of a wider range of storage options and more compatibility between projects when compared to independent blockchain projects like Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Introduced in 2020, AMP is a digital collateral token that can verify transfers of value among different asset types. Projects can use Amp to secure transactions and build networks that are able to initiate and execute transfers instantly and without interference. The AMP token is open-source and decentralized, which provides more potential for the integration of new assets and value transfers.

Amp is currently the 148th largest cryptocurrency project when measured by total market capitalization. It has a daily trading volume of about $15.9 million and a total market capitalization of over $311 million. AMP token is trading for around $0.003858 as of Sept. 2, 2024.

The best trading platform varies based on the investor's needs. Several popular and reputable exchanges are available for trading AMP. Consider these options to begin your crypto trading journey.

You can typically choose from two types of private crypto wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your coins and tokens offline, while software wallets allow you to store your investments online through a software application. Although hardware wallets will incur more of an upfront cost, they provide superior protection because they keep your coins in cold storage.

Explore a few of our favorite wallet choices for ERC-20 tokens like AMP below.

Long considered the gold standard for cryptocurrency cold storage, the Ledger Nano X provides investors with a private set of keys to store Bitcoin, all ERC-20 tokens and many additional assets offline. Your private Ledger key remains safe in a secure chip, and you can assess and access your investments wherever you go. The Ledger Nano X connects with the Ledger Live app for sending and receiving coins and tokens. It also allows the installation of up to 100 decentralized applications (dApps), making it useful for those interested in decentralized finance.

Coinbase is one of the internet's largest cryptocurrency marketplaces -- and its newly introduced Coinbase Wallet makes it easier to manage your investments on-the-go. The Coinbase Wallet is a software program that provides you with complete support for Bitcoin and any type of ERC-20 project. The Coinbase Wallet allows you to send crypto to other users without memorizing a long wallet address -- simply enter a name and transfer crypto in just a few minutes.

When you see your tokens in your exchange wallet, your next step is to decide how you want to earn a return on your investment. These are primary strategies you can use to earn a return on your AMP investment:

No matter which strategy you choose to take, you'll want to monitor the price of AMP and how it's changing regularly.

The cryptocurrency market can be exceptionally volatile. Monitor how the market is changing today with our chart below.

Though Amp's network is currently not one of the most popular cryptocurrency projects currently trading on major exchanges, it still retains a positive investor sentiment for the future. If you're thinking about investing in AMP, you may want to diversify your portfolio with other types of Ethereum-based token projects, like Chainlink or AAVE.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/09154619/amp.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.2784313725490195

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, was $2,577.69 as of 8 a.m. ET. The crypto's highest intraday price in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Although ethereum is not the first altcoin, it's the most popular and successful. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Its blockchain has generated tremendous growth and returns over the past nine years.

Ethereum prices

*The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $310.12 billion. ETH is currently up 55% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 71% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $82.38 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $298 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $292 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based platform. It facilitates secure financial transactions. The network's native token is ether.

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,577.69.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 55% year over year, compared to a 128% gain for bitcoin.

You might be more comfortable using online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Interactive Brokers, Webull, and Robinhood.

Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal have options for buying ETH. Cryptocurrency ATMs also allow for direct purchases.

How to store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1607843137254903

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,354.33.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 45% year over year, compared to a 119% gain for bitcoin.

How to buy ethereum

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

How to safely store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1764705882352942
What is Bitcoin And How Does It Work,https://techbullion.com/what-is-bitcoin-and-how-bitcoin-works/,2024-09-12,TechBullion,"Bitcoin has become a household name, often considered the gold standard of digital currency. But despite its popularity, many people are still unclear about what Bitcoin really is and how it works. In this article, we will explore what Bitcoin is, how it operates, how Bitcoin mining works, how you can buy and store Bitcoin, and its practical uses. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to deepen your understanding of Bitcoin, this guide is designed to provide clear insights into the world's first cryptocurrency.

What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies like the US dollar or the euro, Bitcoin does not rely on a central authority, such as a government or bank, to issue or regulate it. Instead, Bitcoin is powered by a peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions happen directly between users, without an intermediary.

One of the core principles behind Bitcoin is the idea of decentralization. This is made possible by blockchain technology, which ensures that all transactions are recorded on a public ledger that everyone can access but no one can alter. Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and a way to achieve financial independence from traditional banking systems.

How Bitcoin Works

At its most basic level, Bitcoin is a form of digital money. But what sets it apart from traditional currency is the technology that makes it work. Bitcoin operates on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records every transaction made with Bitcoin. These transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography, ensuring that they are secure and irreversible.

Bitcoin can be sent from one person to another anywhere in the world without going through a middleman, such as a bank. This not only reduces fees but also makes Bitcoin transactions incredibly fast and efficient. Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in the process.

In addition to being used for transactions, Bitcoin is often viewed as a store of value, much like gold. As more people buy and hold Bitcoin, its price can increase, making it a potentially lucrative investment for the future.

How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?

Bitcoin mining is the process by which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are added to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. When these problems are solved, a new block is added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with newly created Bitcoin. This process is critical for securing the network and maintaining its decentralized nature.

Mining requires a significant amount of computational power and energy, which is why many miners join ""mining pools"" to combine resources and increase their chances of successfully mining a block. Over time, as more Bitcoins are mined, the reward for mining becomes smaller, making Bitcoin scarcer and, in theory, more valuable.

How to Buy Bitcoin

If you're interested in acquiring Bitcoin, there are several ways to do so. One of the most common methods is purchasing it through a cryptocurrency exchange. To buy Bitcoin, follow these steps:

Choose a reputable exchange - Select a trusted cryptocurrency exchange platform where Bitcoin is available. Create an account - Register on the exchange, providing necessary identification and verification as required by the platform. Deposit funds - Once your account is verified, deposit fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) into your account. Buy Bitcoin - With your deposited funds, navigate to the Bitcoin market, place an order, and purchase the amount of Bitcoin you want.

You can also buy Bitcoin directly from individuals through peer-to-peer platforms or Bitcoin ATMs. However, regardless of how you buy Bitcoin, securing it is of the utmost importance, which brings us to the next section -- how to store Bitcoin securely.

How to Store Bitcoin

Storing Bitcoin safely is a crucial step after purchase, and choosing the right type of wallet plays a significant role in ensuring your cryptocurrency's security. A wallet Bitcoin is essentially a tool that allows you to store, send, and receive Bitcoin. However, not all wallets offer the same level of security or features.

When it comes to securing your Bitcoin, self-custody is key. This means taking full control of your private keys -- the cryptographic keys that allow you to access your Bitcoin. Without control over your private keys, you are relying on third parties to safeguard your assets, which may expose you to potential risks such as hacking or mismanagement.

The Ledger Bitcoin wallet is an excellent solution for those who want the highest level of security and control. As a market leader in cryptocurrency wallets, Ledger has sold over 7 million devices globally. But why is the Ledger Bitcoin wallet trusted by so many?

Self-Custody of Private Keys

With a Ledger Bitcoin wallet, you are in full control of your private keys. This means that you, and only you, can access and manage your Bitcoin. Unlike storing your cryptocurrency on an exchange, where the exchange holds the private keys, self-custody ensures that you are the sole owner of your assets.

Security: Private Key Generated and Stored Offline

One of the most significant advantages of the Ledger Bitcoin wallet is its security. Your private keys are generated and stored offline, making it impossible for hackers to access them remotely. This feature provides an added layer of protection compared to online wallets or exchanges, which are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. This type of offline storage is often referred to as ""cold storage,"" and it's one of the safest methods for storing Bitcoin.

Ledger's Reputation as a Market Leader

With over 7 million devices sold, Ledger has established itself as a trusted name in the cryptocurrency industry. The company has a long-standing reputation for delivering high-quality, secure products that help users protect their digital assets. If you're serious about Bitcoin, using a Ledger Bitcoin wallet offers you peace of mind knowing that your investment is in good hands.

User-Friendly Ledger Live Bitcoin Wallet App

In addition to hardware security, Ledger offers the Ledger Live app, a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily manage your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The app enables you to check your balance, send and receive funds, and monitor the market, all from one convenient platform. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned Bitcoin user, the Ledger Live app makes managing your Bitcoin simple and intuitive.

If you're looking for a secure and trusted way to store your Bitcoin, we recommend using the Ledger Bitcoin wallet.

How To Use Bitcoin

Once you have stored your Bitcoin securely, you may wonder how to use it. Bitcoin can be used in a variety of ways, including:

Making purchases - More and more businesses, both online and offline, are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From e-commerce sites to coffee shops, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular payment method. Sending money internationally - Bitcoin allows for easy cross-border transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. This can be faster and cheaper than traditional wire transfers. Investing and trading - Many people hold onto Bitcoin as a long-term investment, while others actively trade it for profit. The volatility of Bitcoin's price makes it attractive for both short-term traders and long-term investors. FAQ about Bitcoin

Who created Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was created by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. To this day, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown. Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and mined the first block (called the ""genesis block"") in 2009.

Is Bitcoin a good investment?

Bitcoin's value has seen significant growth since its inception, and many view it as a good investment due to its potential for high returns. However, it's important to remember that Bitcoin is highly volatile. Its price can experience drastic fluctuations in short periods. While Bitcoin has been called ""digital gold"" by some, it's essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks before investing.

In conclusion, Bitcoin is more than just digital money -- it represents a revolutionary change in how we perceive and use currency. Whether you're buying, storing, or using Bitcoin, it's crucial to stay informed and take steps to protect your assets, and the Ledger Bitcoin wallet offers a secure and reliable way to store your Bitcoin and take full control of your financial future.

Building a crypto portfolio: A guide for intrepid investors,https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/1054624/building-a-crypto-portfolio-a-guide-for-intrepid-investors-1054624.html,2024-08-22,Proactiveinvestors UK,"Since the first functional cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was released in 2009, complex jargon and gatekeeping terminology have fooled everyday people into believing that crypto is not for them. In reality, it's not so complex. By breaking down the basics into a step-by-step process, the crypto game can seem far less daunting. Sure, there's some risk and a bit of a learning curve, but that's the case for all worthy pursuits. This guide will help you dip your test the waters, and if you think you can handle the heat, you can dive in.

Crypto explained

Cryptocurrencies leverage cryptography for security, existing as digital assets outside traditional banking systems. Unlike fiat currencies, crypto relies on a decentralized ledger called a blockchain for transparent and verifiable transactions. Bitcoin paved the way for a diverse ecosystem of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) aiming to address specific functionalities like faster transactions or powering decentralized applications.

Crypto offers many advantages, and anyone with an internet connection can participate. Freedom from central control allows for faster transactions and potentially lower fees. The crypto market is still young, and some believe it holds immense potential for future growth. And the earning potential doesn't end with investing. Cryptocurrency casino platforms are becoming more dominant in the gambling industry, allowing those who have invested in crypto to securely play their favourite online casino games with the token of their choice, whether it's Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum. For example, an online Ethereum casino gives players the potential to earn more from their investments if they win, or if the value of their coins goes up by the time they make a withdrawal from their casino accounts. Ethereum is preferred to Bitcoin in many cases as it has lower transaction costs and transactions are generally faster.

Earning on crypto is also possible via staking. Staking allows crypto holders to earn rewards by participating in the blockchain network's operations. By locking up their cryptocurrency in a staking pool, users can help validate transactions and maintain the network's security. In return, they receive additional tokens as a reward. This process not only generates passive income but also supports the overall stability and efficiency of the blockchain ecosystem, making it an attractive option for long-term investors.

How blockchain works

Just as you can't fully appreciate the genius of Mozart without first grasping music theory, to truly master the concept of crypto, you must understand blockchain technology. Let's break it down. In layman's terms, think of the blockchain as a powerful super-computer that solves complex mathematical puzzles to verify transactions. Blockchain is a public ledger which records transactions chronologically and transparently. This eliminates the need for a central authority, like a bank, making crypto faster, more secure, and potentially more accessible. When you buy or sell crypto, the transaction details are broadcast to the entire network. These verified transactions are bundled together into ""blocks"" and added to the blockchain decentralised ledger. Cryptography ensures the integrity of each block, making it nearly impossible to tamper with past transactions.

Things to consider before you start

Now that you've grasped the basics, you're probably raring to go. But before diving in headfirst, here are some crucial factors to keep in mind. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. Significant value fluctuations are part of the game. Be prepared for the market to move up and down rapidly. Additionally, be aware that you are venturing into rapidly evolving technological and legal territory. Stay informed about potential regulation changes that might impact your investments and be sure to choose reputable platforms with robust security. Crypto is best suited for level-headed long-term investors who can stomach risk. Be prepared to endure substantial losses but also be equipped to manage large windfalls. Avoid investing money you might need in the short term.

Now, let's get started on building your portfolio....

Step 1: Educate yourself

Knowledge is power. By reading this far, you're already ahead of the game. Before investing, spend time researching different cryptocurrencies. Get to know their underlying technologies and purpose. Reputable resources are a Google search away and include educational content from established crypto exchanges, blockchain technology websites, and articles from financial news outlets with a focus on crypto.

Step 2: Choose your crypto exchange

A crypto exchange is a platform where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing an exchange. Look for a platform with a strong reputation for secure storage and transaction processing. Compare transaction fees and any other associated costs. Ensure the exchange offers the cryptos you're interested in buying. Consider the platform's user interface and how easy it is to navigate.

Step 3: Set up your crypto wallet

A crypto wallet is where you'll store your holdings. There are two main types. First, hot wallets. These are software wallets that are convenient to access but may be more susceptible to hacking. Then there are cold wallets. These are hardware wallets that offer increased security but are less convenient for everyday transactions. For beginners, starting with a hot wallet from a reputable provider is the safe option. However, if you plan on investing a significant amount, consider a cold wallet for enhanced security.

Step 4: Fund your account

Once you've chosen your exchange and set up your wallet, it's time to fund your account. Most exchanges allow deposits through bank transfers, debit cards, or even credit cards (though fees might be higher for credit cards). How much to invest? That's up to you.

Step 5: Start investing

Now comes the exciting part - making your first crypto purchase! Remember, diversification is key. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider allocating your funds among established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with potentially promising altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies).

If you're a gamer, crypto casinos are worth trying out to gain even more from your investment. With their provably fair gaming systems, fast payout times and enhanced cryptography and blockchain-fueled security systems, this new gaming platform is making its place in the gambling industry. If you're someone who wants to take their cryptocurrency game to the next level, crypto casinos are a great place to start.

Step 6: Monitor your portfolio

The crypto market is dynamic. Don't expect to set it and forget it. It's considered a hobby for a reason. Regularly monitor your portfolio to stay informed about market trends and the performance of your chosen cryptocurrencies. It's easy to stay updated with industry news and analysis if you engage with online communities of crypto enthusiasts to learn from their experiences and insights. Additionally utilizing mobile applications will allow you to track the real-time prices of various cryptocurrencies efficiently.

Remember, the information you gather should be used to inform your investment decisions, not dictate them impulsively. Develop a long-term strategy and avoid emotional decisions based on short-term market movements.

Step 7: Stay secure

The decentralized nature of crypto comes with the responsibility of safeguarding your own assets. Here are some essential security practices:

Use unique and complex passwords for your exchange accounts and wallets. Consider using a password manager for better security. Enable 2FA on all your crypto-related accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification code when logging in. Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages claiming to be from crypto exchanges or wallets. These could be phishing scams that are attempting to trick you into revealing your login credentials or wallet information. Finally, if you're using a hot wallet, ensure you have a secure backup of your wallet data. This allows you to recover your crypto holdings if you lose access to your device.

Additional considerations

Some cryptocurrencies offer staking rewards for holding their tokens. This involves locking up your crypto for a specific period in exchange for earning interest. This DeFi (Decentralized Finance) strategy involves lending your crypto assets to earn interest on them. However, it can be complex. Also, consider NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). These unique digital assets represent ownership of digital items like artwork or collectables. While NFTs are not strictly part of a cryptocurrency portfolio, they are part of the broader blockchain ecosystem.

The future of crypto

The future of cryptocurrency remains uncertain, but its potential is undeniable. While challenges like regulation and scalability need to be addressed, advancements are constantly being made. The worldwide bank Standard Chartered recently announced that they're opening a crypto trading deck. This is a good sign for crypto users, indicating that standardisation may be on the horizon.

Cryptocurrency's fast and borderless transactions have the potential to revolutionize how we send and receive money internationally. DeFi applications offer an alternative financial system built on blockchain technology, potentially providing greater financial inclusion and transparency. Blockchain's ability to track data securely can improve supply chain management by ensuring transparency and traceability.

What have we learned?

Building a crypto portfolio is an exciting and rewarding journey, so long as you approach it with a long-term perspective. Remember, crypto is a volatile asset class, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Do your research, invest responsibly, and stay informed. With the right approach, crypto might be the most valuable addition to your investment portfolio.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA4XC9idXNpbmVzc3dvbWFuLXVzZXMtbGFwdG9wLWNvbXB1dGVyLXdvcmxkLWN1cnJlbmNpZXMtYml0Y29pbi13YWxsZXQtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktb24tdmlydHVhbC1zY3JlZW5fNjZjNmVmMDQzMzE3ZC5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,0.1450980392156862
Cryptocurrency Exchange Platforms Explained: Navigating the World of Digital Currencies with Confidence,https://techbullion.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-platforms-explained-navigating-the-world-of-digital-currencies-with-confidence/,2024-08-27,TechBullion,"Cryptocurrency exchanges are the bustling marketplaces of the digital currency world, where traders and investors buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and an ever-growing list of altcoins. These platforms are fundamental to the operation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, enabling millions of users worldwide to engage in this new form of financial interaction. However, navigating these platforms can be daunting, especially given the complexities and risks associated with digital currencies. This report delves into how these exchanges work, their types, and the key factors to consider when choosing one, helping you navigate the world of digital currencies with confidence.

Understanding Cryptocurrency Exchanges

A cryptocurrency exchange is essentially a digital marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. These platforms typically support a variety of cryptocurrencies, offering tools that facilitate the exchange of digital currencies for fiat money (such as the U.S. dollar) or other cryptocurrencies. Exchanges are the backbone of the crypto market, providing the liquidity necessary for the market's functioning and enabling price discovery for various cryptocurrencies.

There are two primary types of cryptocurrency exchanges: centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): These are the most common type of exchanges, where a central authority manages transactions and maintains order books. Users trade through the platform, which acts as an intermediary, offering features like advanced trading options, margin trading, and, in some cases, insurance against losses from hacks. Popular centralized exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. These platforms are generally user-friendly and offer high liquidity, making them attractive to both novice and experienced traders. However, they require users to trust the exchange with their funds, which introduces counterparty risk.

Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Unlike CEXs, decentralized exchanges operate without a central authority. Instead, they use smart contracts on blockchain networks to facilitate trades directly between users (peer-to-peer). This model eliminates the need for users to trust a central entity, enhancing security and privacy. However, DEXs often suffer from lower liquidity and higher complexity in use compared to their centralized counterparts. Examples of DEXs include Uniswap, Sushiswap, and PancakeSwap. These platforms are growing in popularity, especially among users who prioritize privacy and control over their funds.

Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Cryptocurrency Exchange

When selecting a cryptocurrency exchange, several critical factors must be considered to ensure a safe and efficient trading experience:

Security: The security of a cryptocurrency exchange is paramount. Given the history of high-profile hacks in the crypto space, such as the Mt. Gox incident, choosing an exchange with robust security measures is crucial. Look for exchanges that offer two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage of funds, and insurance policies against theft. Exchanges like Kraken and Gemini are well-regarded for their security features, with Kraken offering additional layers of protection through its ""Kraken Security Labs"".

Fees: Transaction fees can significantly impact the profitability of trading, especially for high-frequency traders. Fees on cryptocurrency exchanges can vary widely, with some platforms charging flat fees, while others use a tiered system based on trading volume. Kraken, for instance, is known for its low fees, particularly on its professional trading platform, Kraken Pro. On the other hand, Coinbase, while more beginner-friendly, has higher fees compared to some other platforms.

Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easily assets can be bought or sold on an exchange without affecting the asset's price. High liquidity is crucial for traders, as it ensures that transactions can be executed quickly and at the desired price. Binance is known for its high liquidity, being the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. High liquidity is particularly important for those trading large amounts of cryptocurrency.

User Experience: The ease of use is another important factor, especially for beginners. Platforms like Coinbase and Crypto.com offer intuitive interfaces and easy-to-use mobile apps, making them ideal for newcomers to the crypto space. More advanced users might prefer exchanges like Binance or Kraken, which offer more sophisticated trading tools and analytics.

Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is rapidly evolving, with different countries imposing varying degrees of regulation. It's important to choose an exchange that complies with the regulatory requirements of your jurisdiction to ensure the safety of your investments. Exchanges that adhere to strict regulatory standards, such as Coinbase, which is registered with several regulatory bodies worldwide, provide an additional layer of security and trust.

Asset Variety: Depending on your investment strategy, the variety of cryptocurrencies available on an exchange might be a significant consideration. Some platforms offer a wide range of assets, including lesser-known altcoins, while others focus on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, KuCoin supports over 700 digital assets, offering extensive opportunities for diversification.

Customer Support: Reliable customer support can be crucial, especially in an industry as volatile as cryptocurrency. Users should look for exchanges that offer responsive and helpful customer service to resolve issues promptly. Unfortunately, some large exchanges, despite their size, have been criticized for poor customer support. Therefore, it's advisable to check reviews and experiences of other users regarding customer service.

The Future of Cryptocurrency Exchanges

The cryptocurrency exchange landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by technological advancements and changing regulatory frameworks. Several trends are shaping the future of these platforms:

Decentralized Finance (DeFi): DeFi is transforming the financial industry by enabling decentralized applications (dApps) that provide financial services without intermediaries. This trend is leading to the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs), which are becoming increasingly popular for their ability to offer financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading in a decentralized manner.

Integration with Traditional Finance: As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, exchanges are integrating with traditional financial systems. This includes offering services like crypto debit cards, which allow users to spend their cryptocurrencies directly, and staking options, where users can earn interest on their holdings.

Regulatory Changes: Governments around the world are tightening regulations around cryptocurrency exchanges, focusing on issues like anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. These regulations are likely to increase, affecting how exchanges operate and how they serve their users.

Enhanced Security Measures: With the ever-present threat of cyberattacks, exchanges are continuously improving their security measures. Future developments may include more widespread adoption of multi-signature wallets, hardware security modules, and improved encryption technologies to protect user funds.

Increased Adoption of NFTs and Tokenization: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the tokenization of assets are becoming integral parts of the cryptocurrency market. Exchanges are increasingly supporting these digital assets, allowing users to trade NFTs and tokenize real-world assets, expanding the scope and functionality of these platforms.

Conclusion

Navigating the world of cryptocurrency exchanges requires careful consideration of various factors, from security and fees to liquidity and regulatory compliance. As digital currencies continue to grow in popularity and acceptance, these platforms will play an increasingly important role in the global financial ecosystem. Whether you are a beginner looking to make your first cryptocurrency purchase or an experienced trader seeking advanced features, understanding how to choose and use these exchanges will be crucial for your success in the digital currency market.

Whichever version you choose, some of these wallets are compatible with cold storage solutions, allowing you to secure your funds with an extra layer of security.

DeFi is often called the Wild West of finance, so safety and security mechanisms are paramount when choosing any type of wallet, not just those supporting TRON. Certain security measures are a must, such as:

Moreover, it is good practice to check a wallet's reputation in the crypto community and on social media. Check for transparency, the development team's approach to security protocols, and any partnerships with third parties.

A wallet that's simple to use yet offers advanced features convenient for new and seasoned crypto users. Often, those users praise a wallet with a simple, clean interface and intuitive navigation as it enhances the overall experience.

Moreover, different wallets offer different features, so know what you're looking for and identify the ones important to you. Standard features to look for include:

Wallets may charge fees for transactions, deposits, and withdrawals. This is no different with TRON-dedicated wallets or those that support TRX. Therefore, it's critical to compare these fees among different wallets, as some may be more cost-effective than others, and understand the fee structure to avoid unexpected costs.

A good TRON wallet should offer robust backup and recovery options. It is crucial to have a reliable way to recover your account in case you lose access to your wallet. Look for secure wallets that back up your private keys or recovery phrases.

TRON is a comprehensive and innovative blockchain ecosystem that redefines digital content distribution and promotes a decentralized internet. As it continues to grow and adapt, TRON is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized digital platforms.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,389.66, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $287.48 billion. ETH is currently up 46% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 71% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $77.53 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $315 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $296 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,389.66.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 120% year over year, compared to a 46% gain for ethereum.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765
How to Spot the Next 100x Meme Coins?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-spot-the-next-100x-meme-coins/,2024-08-31,Cryptopolitan,"Meme coins offer an easy entry into a dynamic market, where virtually anyone could generate a new project. The first digital asset of this type was Dogecoin (DOGE), an asset that aimed to use crypto technology for fun. DOGE was in fact a full coin, which relied on proof-of-work just like Bitcoin. Later, meme asset used token technology, and relied on other chains like Ethereum or Solana.

The meme coin market ranges from projects with utility and elaborate reward systems, to humorous themes with a nonsensical image. The biggest attraction of meme assets was their ability to grow from nothing into a multi-billion projects, appreciating faster than the rest of the crypto market and taking the spotlight from Bitcoin maximalists.

Market timing and luck meant some early buyers easily achieved 1000X appreciation and soon those opportunities took the crypto world by a storm. Grabbing the next 100X meme coin may also require additional research as the market conditions shift and buyers become more cautious. In this guide, we will cover techniques on how to spot next 100x meme coins and exploit their unique cryptocurrency potential.

Types of meme coins

Meme coins, as their name suggests, are based on the images and visual language of Internet, spawned on forums, message boards, chat apps and social media. The market for meme-based digital assets emerged from a single image, that of Kabosu, the original Shiba Inu dog that drove the success of DOGE. The strong community of DOGE took the crypto market by a storm, even competing with major cryptocurrencies. DOGE was the first meme to reach a market cap above $1B and has remained a top cryptocurrency for years.

The first generation of derivative memes also followed the ""doge"" model, spawning Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FlokiInu (FLOKI). Soon, several other categories of memes appeared, again riding on the joke of the Shiba Inu breed.

Doge-themed

Still using the Shiba Inu breed, a series of copies appeared, aiming to build communities around a familiar image.

Frogs/Pepes: The original Pepe is a widely known cartoon character, created by artist Mark Furie. Pepe became an Internet icon on the former Twitter social media, after becoming the go-to meme on 4Chan. Pepe-themed assets can be launched independently, but are also closely tied to PolitiFi. The meme also spawned the Original Pepe NFT collection.

Cat-themed

Those images aimed to be cute and harmless, capitalizing on the Internet's love of cats. Cat-themed launches often focus on communities and compete with doge-themed projects.

PolitiFi: this section of memes is the most contentious, focusing on political wars and themes freshly derived from world events. The main focus of PolitiFi remains US politics and the Presidential election. PolitiFi derives its images from Internet art, often an example of Wojaks, the visual shorthand for political affiliations.

Celebrity

Big and small celebrities from sports, show business or dubious Internet fame have tried to capitalize on the frenzy. Unlike organic memes, celebrity projects are often viewed with suspicion, despite also outperforming in the short term.

Trends: WifHat, wrapped, baby are all modifiers of existing memes. Other similar images have no claims to greatness, except being appealing and cozy. Accessorized assets, especially ""WifHat"", tend to draw loyal communities, focusing on holding until the token breaks to a new price level.

Top blockchains for meme activity

Features like the speed, fees and the available liquidity of the chain set the pace for permissionless swapping. The availability of bots and general popularity also shape the possibilities for investors.

Almost all chains and networks can generate decentralized liquidity pairs, but the most active ecosystems only rely on a handful of leading platforms.

Solana

Since 2023, Solana has become the home to the most active decentralized trade. As a cryptocurrency, SOL has had wide adoption and become a source of value for decentralized market pairs. SOL is still among the top cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization.

Driven by bots, but also real users, Solana's decentralized market got a boost from the most influential projects, including PEPE, BOME, WIF, POPCAT, MEW and others. Those top trading pairs set the stage for similar features, while carrying meme trading into mainstream centralized exchanges. Solana's ecosystem includes the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX), where a listing allows a coin to grow and gain buyers.

Ethereum

The original network for tokenization, Ethereum was also the home of Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the first tokenized memes. Ethereum relies on Uniswap for new token liquidity. Sometimes, there are competing versions, as in the case of Neiro (NEIRO), launched both on Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum carries the ETH cryptocurrency, which has relatively high barriers to entry because of its high price. Gas fees are one of the features of Ethereum that can still discourage retail investors.

Base

The Base blockchain, launched by Coinbase, is a tokenless protocol with a login-based wallet. Due to the lower fees and easier user onboarding, Base has more registered activity than Ethereum. Almost all memes have a Base version, relying either on Uniswap or Aerodrome.

Toncoin

Toncoin is the chain closely tied to Telegram users. Meme creation on Toncoin is a bit more deliberate. Some of the Toncoin assets are only created after building a Telegram community and setting up expectations for an airdrop. Memes on Toncoin also do not copy all the themes from Ethereum and Solana, instead they often track the interests and hype on obscure Telegram communities.

Others

Practically all L1 and L2 chains have attracted meme communities. Dextools lists more than 80 networks, with BNBChain, Polygon and TRON among the most active. Some chains have practically no activity, so using the current dashboard is the best way to estimate whether a chain is active enough and offers sufficient liquidity. Using smaller chains poses the additional challenge of buying obscure and illiquid native coins. Not all L2 small chains lock in enough value to ensure robust decentralized features.

How to find new meme coins

One of the main sources of liquidity pairs that start from nothing and grow into $1B valuations are launchpads like Pump.fun or Moonshot.

New listings start with minimal liquidity and trade erratically, while trying to generate attention, bring in more traders and boost liquidity to become top coins. After reaching sufficient liquidity, the newly listed meme coins can move on to a decentralized exchange like Raydium or Uniswap.

Discovering meme coins on Moonshot

Moonshot does not have its own website, but is available through Dexscreener, offering intuitive access to newly listed, trending or already established coins. Moonshot is a new tool for crypto enthusiasts, listing new pairs before they move onto a cryptocurrency exchange.

The platforms offer a fair launch for brand-new assets and serve to build up both interest and liquidity. Once a predetermined level of liquidity is reached, the pair moves on to Raydium and can start more regular activity with higher volumes.

At the start of picking a new meme coin, users must connect one of the approved wallets. The platforms work even for traders with no available wallet, and will redirect them to MetaMask, Phantom or other compatible wallets.

Moonshot DexScreener will provide an intuitive preview of the newest, as well as the hottest trending meme tokens and top meme coins. Moonshot listings will have an intuitive progress bar to estimate how far they are from achieving enough liquidity to be ""finalized"" and move on to other DEX.

The progress bar and time since launch will give a clear visual on whether a popular meme coin is on the move, or it has stalled in building up liquidity.

Discovering meme coins with Pump.fun

Pump.fun takes a less formal approach to listing new meme tokens. Since a record number of projects are listing, the launchpad has a very basic interface, with no tools to filter the new tokens. Pump.fun offers a random selection of meme coins, but they can be filtered for relevance based on previous wallet activity.

Listings on Pump.fun also offer access to the profile of creators, to track for serial launches and previously successful investments. Overall, an estimated 99% of meme launches will fail to reach Raydium. Pump.fun recently added live chats to each new launch, to give a glimpse of the community and potential interest as factors for success. Some of the tokens will have market cap badges, or notify potential buyers about livestreams. A live stream will often coincide with a short-term meme coin pump.

Even with highly original memes, Pump.fun launches are often not engineered for mass appeal and fail to grab the attention of social media.

Conditions on Pump.fun may change overnight. Most traders in the crypto community focus on newly launched tokens, which survive for only a few hours in their initial trading. Even a 100X pair in that initial stage can have very low returns and negligible liquidity. The ability to mint for a low cost or for free creates an unlimited amount of new launches, where the main strategy is to ""ape"" as fast as possible with small initial investments.

Meme coins on Raydium and Uniswap

Once the listed pair achieve escape liquidity, they are listed as new pairs on the respective DEX. Solana meme coins land on Raydium. To access new trading pairs, aggregators like DexScreener or Dextools will give an overview of liquidity, activity and other information on whether the pair has stabilized.

New pairs will often also fail, just minutes after being listed on a DEX. Early-stage meme coins can have the biggest upside, but it is also matched by the high failure rate of nearly 99%. To ensure new meme coins are liquid, DEX trends give a glimpse of top meme coins and have healthy trading pools.

Trending themes give a glimpse of where retail has moved in, and which memes are the most appealing.

Meme coins pre-selected by whales or smart traders

Copying a whale or a high-profile wallet may be a suitable strategy to finding a 100X meme token.

The best way to find currently active whales is through Dextools. Among currently trending communities, the occasional whale transaction will expose wallet addresses with a longer risk-taking history.

Sometimes, whales also appear in the order books of daily losers, the coins that erased most of their value. Whale action may signal the asset is ready to recover and outperform.

Manually checking the activity of whales may be too time-consuming. Tools like Dexchecker will give a preview of ""large trades"" and their latest activities. Then, move onto the ""Wallet Screener"" tab, and explore a whale's activity history.

Some of the addresses which have shown good performance can then be tracked for buying additional meme coins. Whale watching apps can create alerts when the selected wallets are active.

How to snipe meme coins

One way to spot the next 100X meme coins is to look at newly launched pairs on decentralized exchanges.

Dextools offers a filter to access meme coins, including a selection based on the liquidity pair age. Setting up the filter will produce a list of assets and their earnings for a specified date. New pairs may appreciate by thousands of percent within hours.

Setting up filters will bring out the hottest pairs with a relatively small age. High liquidity may be a positive sign that the liquidity pool will be more resilient.

Filtering out the best 100X meme coins will also depend on the prevalence of buyers. Before committing to a meme coin, it is best to check back on its wallet profile and make sure there are no worrying insider holdings or wallet clusters on Bubblemaps.

How to get the next 100X meme coin with a sniping bot

Buying a newly launched coin on Ethereum or Solana may not be straightforward and may depend on gas fee conditions. Transactions on Solana or Ethereum may be more costly than usual, especially for very fast purchases within the next block.

One of the most widely used bots to snipe coins on Solana is BonkBot, a Telegram-based app. BonkBot will put speed first and buy as fast as possible by simply pasting the token address.

BonkBot has a native wallet that needs a SOL deposit to start buying. The main function of BoinkBot is to buy meme coins very quickly, by using Solana services like Jupiter DEX aggregator and the JitoSOL validator.

To achieve its goal of sniping, BonkBot does not pay attention to the required fees or price slippage. For some coins, the buying fees may surpass the potential earnings. BonkBot is considered secure, but it is crucial to be aware of risks and avoid investing money you are not prepared to lose.

Several related Telegram bots can perform even faster than BonkBot but incur unpredictable fees. Transaction speed may also lag behind professional traders with high-speed connection and running RPC nodes for faster access.

BonkBot Telegram channels also perform pre-selection to notice a trend, with the potential to buy very fast without leaving the channel. The projects may seem relatively safe to invest in, but they still hold some risk of a rug pull.

How to do due diligence on new meme coins

Top meme coins can still grow by 100X after reaching decentralized exchanges. Even at that stage, the relatively new trending pairs need additional research to reassure against a rug pull and a crash to zero. Most new additions to Raydium or Uniswap will indeed go to zero, as early investors realize lower profits and lock in gains.

To make sure a coin pair has locked liquidity and will not go through a rug pull, click on its name on Dextools, then check the side bar for additional data. Projects with locked liquidity will have an icon, displaying the available pools and whether any locks are in place.

Before committing to a token, also check for duplicates, copycats or scams. The Rugcheck tool on Solana will check for duplicate tickers. TokenSniffer will also monitor the blockchain for known scams or honeypots.

Community engagement will also give a glimpse of a growing project. The communities of early meme coins like PEPE, BOME, SLERF, WIF and even SHIB and FLOKI show high-level activity and engagement. Online communities also warn of possible scams and set the terms of engagement to avoid malicious links in comments or in messages.

Social media content arrives at a later stage and will point to the potential development of a token. Some assets work as ""degen"" meme coins, where buying the dips or ""aping"" is the most common strategy. Others, like PEPE and WIF, focus on long-term holding, while waiting for adoption and 100X rallies.

Once a trading pair has established liquidity, it is still necessary to see if trading would be fair. Bubblemaps can check smart contracts and visualize the presence of large wallets.

The most important element to look for on Bubblemaps is ""wallet clusters,"" which are connected wallets that trade or move meme coins between them. A wallet cluster is easy to spot when visualized. Clusters are usually the work of insiders, who use them to fake token traffic and trading.

Even coins with some investment history may develop clusters after insiders buy back at low prices or move in to create fake volumes.

Bubblemaps works by inputting the name of the chosen asset or its address and then looking over the visualization to check for connected wallets. For example, a wallet cluster will display constant transactions between wallets based on blockchain data.

How to find 100X meme coins with established liquidity

Identifying and sniping an early-stage project may be risky and incur additional costs. But even more established meme coins can deliver 100X growth. Other meme coins with top volume can indicate a more promising investment while avoiding stagnation. Tools like Dexcheck will show which older pairs are trending and which ones are stagnating.

Another tool to discover investments is Dexcheck, which also built a section to explore whale holdings and the success of high-frequency trading wallets.

At this stage, the project's social media footprint gains importance. An explosive growth in followers or posting, as well as announcements, can show if a meme coin is here to stay.

Established meme coins also show a rollover of traders. Buying the dip in digital assets can lead to significant appreciation, though the 100X growth stage may not be possible.

One fast way to discover the next 100X meme coin is to ask a chatbot. The Tokenmetrics AI tool is still experimental but can aggregate suggestions on potential winners.

Meme coins rely on their X (formerly Twitter) communities, but some are also growing their influence on Telegram. A growing community of channels may indicate enough holders to avoid a rug pull, at least in the short term.

How to swap memes securely

Meme coins are inherently risky, but there may be additional ways to lose SOL or ETH. Telegram sniping bots are risky, due to the usage of their groups. Scams through DM attempt to steal private keys and can also drain wallets. Some bots may also be inherently risky, or at least unpredictably expensive to use.

Always perform your own research, as there are risks involved at all stages of investing.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/How-to-spot-the-next-100x-meme-coins.jpg,0.5450980392156863
Top 10 Tron (TRX) Wallets in 2024: Best Options Reviewed | tron Guides | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/8435a-best-tron-trx-wallets,2024-08-21,CryptoRank,"Tron was founded in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, spearheaded by Chinese-born Granadian crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. It's one of the industry's most popular decentralized blockchain platforms and one of the largest coins by market capitalization, often ranking in the top ten.

TRX is the blockchain's native currency, used to pay for transactions, provide voting rights, and incentivize user engagement through staking and other rewards. In other words, TRX is the lifeblood of the Tron ecosystem.

Two features that stand out from Tron are the low fees, often as low as $0.000005, and the network's scalability, processing between 1,500 - 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). Moreover, Tron provides users with a dynamic ecosystem catering to several applications and use cases: decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and more.

With so many features and use cases, you must choose the best Tron wallet that suits your needs and helps you achieve your goals. Without further ado, let's get right into it.

Ledger is widely regarded as one of the safest options for storing cryptocurrencies, primarily because it uses a hardware wallet design that keeps your private keys offline. Key features contributing to its security include Cold Storage, which makes it less vulnerable to online hacking attempts, and a Secure Operating System (BOLOS), specifically designed to enhance security.

Moreover, all Ledger devices use a Secure Element Chip, similar to the technology found in passports and credit cards, to safeguard sensitive data. Your private keys are stored securely on the device, ensuring they never leave it, which significantly reduces the risk of online threats.

Regarding the Bluetooth feature on the Nano X, Ledger uses Bluetooth Low Energy for connectivity and assures that only public data is transmitted, with private keys remaining securely on the device.

This could be a concern if you prioritize advanced security features.

However, the Exodus team is proactive in keeping you informed about the wallet's status and any vulnerabilities that have been addressed through regular software updates. The security of your Exodus wallet is largely dependent on the security of the device on which it is installed. If your device is lost, compromised, or left unattended, your funds could be at risk.

Here are several critical factors to remember when selecting a TRON wallet.

This may be a no-brainer, but make sure the wallet you're looking for is compatible with the device you plan to use. For instance, consider a mobile version if you're looking for flexibility and managing your tokens on the go. If you're constantly working with your computer or laptop, desktop wallets are a great option, too. They also offer a broader list of features and services -- though they are often complicated to install and use.

Some wallets are designed as browser extensions, allowing you to download and install them (very straightforwardly) in Opera, Chrome, Firefox, and other popular search engines.

Whichever version you choose, some of these wallets are compatible with cold storage solutions, allowing you to secure your funds with an extra layer of security.

DeFi is often called the Wild West of finance, so safety and security mechanisms are paramount when choosing any type of wallet, not just those supporting TRON. Certain security measures are a must, such as:

Moreover, it is good practice to check a wallet's reputation in the crypto community and on social media. Check for transparency, the development team's approach to security protocols, and any partnerships with third parties.

A wallet that's simple to use yet offers advanced features convenient for new and seasoned crypto users. Often, those users praise a wallet with a simple, clean interface and intuitive navigation as it enhances the overall experience.

Moreover, different wallets offer different features, so know what you're looking for and identify the ones important to you. Standard features to look for include:

Wallets may charge fees for transactions, deposits, and withdrawals. This is no different with TRON-dedicated wallets or those that support TRX. Therefore, it's critical to compare these fees among different wallets, as some may be more cost-effective than others, and understand the fee structure to avoid unexpected costs.

A good TRON wallet should offer robust backup and recovery options. It is crucial to have a reliable way to recover your account in case you lose access to your wallet. Look for secure wallets that back up your private keys or recovery phrases.

TRON is a comprehensive and innovative blockchain ecosystem that redefines digital content distribution and promotes a decentralized internet. As it continues to grow and adapt, TRON is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized digital platforms. Hence, those interested in exploring this ecosystem might find the above wallets a good option.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/best_tron_wallets_cover.jpg,0.3176470588235294
Ethereum price today: ETH is up 1.52% today,https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-10-2024/,2024-09-10,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,350.86, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Although ethereum is not the first altcoin, it's the most popular and successful. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Its blockchain has generated tremendous growth and returns over the past nine years.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $282.91 billion. It's up 48% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $282.91 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $307 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $292 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 70% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based platform. It facilitates secure financial transactions. The network's native token is ether.

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,350.86.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 124% and ETH is up 48% year over year.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to safely store ethereum

Anyone buying ethereum directly must store their ETH in a cryptocurrency wallet. This is much like storing paper money in a physical wallet.

Private keys are needed to send or receive cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. The person who controls a wallet's private keys controls all the cryptocurrency associated with the wallet.

Ethereum wallets can be hardware wallets resembling USB sticks or software wallet apps that store ETH on a smartphone or another device. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are not. Hot wallets are generally considered more convenient, but cold wallets can be safer and more secure.

Ethereum ETFs

In addition to buying ethereum directly, you can indirectly speculate on the ethereum market via ethereum funds.

The SEC approved the first wave of ethereum futures ETFs in late 2023. These ETFs don't invest in ethereum directly but instead hold ethereum futures contracts. Leading ethereum futures ETFs include the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) and the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).

In July 2024, ether spot ETFs made their debut. These include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

A similar decision was made for bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 in terms of spot holdings. The approval of spot ETFs indicates a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1764705882352942

Best Altcoins to Buy: Top Picks Based on Market Analysis and Growth Potential,https://coinpaper.com/5236/best-altcoins-to-buy,2024-08-29,Coinpaper,"Discovering the best altcoins to buy can be a game-changer for those eager to dive into cryptocurrencies. As of August 2024, market analytics and expert opinions point to several standout options. Ethereum (ETH) remains a top favorite, boasting a market cap of $316 billion and a 1-year return of 77%. Its longstanding reputation and robust platform for smart contracts make it a reliable choice.

Another notable contender is Avalanche (AVAX). Known for its Avalanche Consensus, this altcoin offers high transaction speeds and energy efficiency, crucial for supporting decentralized applications and customizable blockchain networks. Many experts, including those on platforms like Crypto Twitter, highlight AVAX's expanding ecosystem as a significant reason for its rising popularity.

Solana (SOL) is frequently lauded in crypto circles for its innovative technology and impressive growth potential. Often praised for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalable network, Solana is a key player in the altcoin market. Investors can stay ahead in the ever-evolving crypto landscape by focusing on these promising assets.

Altcoins refer to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. These digital currencies often aim to improve Bitcoin's technology by offering enhanced features or better performance. Ethereum, for example, introduced smart contracts, which allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps).

Each altcoin serves a different purpose. Ethereum (ETH) is known for its robust smart contract capabilities. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) focus on scalability, enabling faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum.

Market experts believe altcoins have the potential to drive significant innovation. Ethereum, for example, has a strong community and multiple use cases, making it a top pick for many investors.

These altcoins vary in market capitalization:

Avalanche (AVAX) has gained attention for being a leading layer-one blockchain for dApps, competing with Ethereum.

Crypto analysts on Twitter and industry blogs emphasize the importance of technological advancements and community support. For example, Ethereum's recent approval of spot Ether ETFs has bolstered its market position.

Technology plays a crucial role in the success of altcoins. NEAR Protocol is noted for its scalability through sharding, while Optimism focuses on providing leading layer 2 solutions for Ethereum.

Investors need specific techniques to choose the best altcoins. These methods help assess price trends, project viability, and market sentiment.

Technical analysis involves studying price charts and trading volumes. Traders use moving averages and relative strength index (RSI) to identify trends and potential price movements.

Moving Averages help smooth out price data to create a trend-following indicator. Meanwhile, RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. Levels above 70 indicate an overbought condition, while below 30 suggest oversold.

Empirical evidence suggests that combining these tools can improve trading precision. For instance, crypto expert @CryptoTraderXYZ on Twitter noted, ""Combining moving averages with RSI gives a clearer market direction.""

Fundamental analysis examines the intrinsic value of an altcoin. This involves evaluating the project's whitepaper, development team, partnerships, and use cases.

Key aspects include the technology behind the coin, such as Ethereum's smart contracts or Avalanche's fast transaction speeds. Crypto News highlights Ethereum as the top altcoin an altcoin's intrinsic value. This is due to its significant market cap and utility.

Intriguingly, many industry experts emphasize the importance of active development communities. For example, @TechWriteJohn, on Twitter, stated, ""A committed development team can push a project to new heights.""

Sentiment analysis gauges the mood of the market participants. Social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and specialized crypto forums are helpful here.

This manual or automated analysis monitors keywords and phrases linked with specific altcoins. Tools like LunarCRUSH can track social media mentions and potentially predict market movements.

Recently, altcoins like Solana have gained momentum mainly due to strong community support. According to @CryptoAnalystMax on Twitter, ""Community discourse can often pre-empt price increases.""

By combining these analysis techniques, investors can decide which altcoins have the best growth potential.

Investing in altcoins can be a strategic move for diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio. Each altcoin caters to different market needs: smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), or privacy.

Smart contract platforms are essential for decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum is a well-known leader in this category. Its blockchain supports various applications, including finance, games, and more. Ethereum 2.0 upgrades aim to improve its scalability and reduce fees, making it an attractive investment.

Cardano is another smart contract platform gaining traction. Known for its research-driven approach, Cardano focuses on scalability and sustainability. Recent updates, like the Alonzo hard fork, have enabled smart contracts, bringing it closer to Ethereum's capabilities.

Avalanche is also popular among investors. Its high throughput and low latency are lauded, making it suitable for various applications. Avalanche's sub-second finality and compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts increase its appeal.

DeFi tokens represent a new era of financial services without traditional intermediaries. Uniswap is a well-known DeFi token that serves as a decentralized exchange (DEX). UNI's governance token allows holders to vote on important protocol changes. The platform's ease of use and liquidity pools attract many users.

Chainlink is another important DeFi token. It provides decentralized oracles that bring off-chain data into smart contracts. This capability is crucial for many DeFi applications, making LINK a strong investment choice. Chainlink's partnerships with major players add to its credibility.

Aave is also noteworthy. This decentralized lending protocol lets users earn interest on deposits and borrow assets. The AAVE token gives holders governance rights and access to reduced fees on the platform. Aave's robust security measures and growing user base make it a solid option.

Privacy coins offer enhanced anonymity features, crucial for users who value confidentiality. Monero is a leading privacy coin known for its strong emphasis on privacy. It uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to obfuscate transactions, making it challenging to trace transaction history.

Zcash is another prominent privacy coin. It offers optional anonymity through its zk-SNARKs cryptographic technology, which enables shielded transactions. This feature allows Zcash to provide both transparent and private transactions.

Dash also falls into the privacy coin category. It provides optional privacy features through PrivateSend, which mixes coins to obscure their origin. Dash's focus on fast, low-cost transactions makes it versatile for various uses, including everyday spending.

Several strategies should be considered when investing in altcoins. These include long-term holding, active trading, and diversification, each offering unique benefits and risks.

Long-term holding, or ""HODLing,"" involves purchasing altcoins and holding them for an extended period. This strategy relies on the belief that the coin's value will increase significantly over time.

Popular altcoins for long-term investment often include Ethereum and Avalanche.

Investors aim to benefit from long-term growth by holding these assets through market fluctuations and holding altcoins. This strategy requires patience and a strong belief in the future potential of the chosen altcoins.

Active trading involves buying and selling altcoins frequently to capitalize on short-term market movements. This strategy is best suited for those who can dedicate time to monitoring market trends and executing trades quickly.

Platforms like Binance and Coinbase Pro are popular choices for active traders. Tools such as technical analysis charts and signals are essential for success in this approach.

Active traders often focus on coins like Solana and Chainlink, as these assets are known for their volatility and trading volume.

Diversification involves spreading investments across different altcoins to mitigate risk. By holding various assets, investors can protect themselves from the downturn of any single coin.

A diversified portfolio might include top performers like Ethereum and BNB and emerging altcoins like NEAR Protocol and Optimism.

This strategy allows investors to benefit from different sectors of the crypto market, such as DeFi and NFTs, without putting all their capital into one asset.

Investors should continuously research and adjust their portfolios. Crypto Twitter and news outlets provide valuable insights and updates on market trends and sentiment, aiding in making informed decisions.

Investing in altcoins carries significant risks. One effective way to manage these risks is by diversifying your portfolio. Don't put all your funds into one altcoin. Spread your investments across various altcoins to minimize potential losses.

Market volatility is another risk. Crypto markets can be volatile. Keep an eye on market trends and price movements. Set stop-loss orders to sell automatically if the price drops below a certain level.

Research thoroughly. Before investing, understand the technology behind the altcoin, its use cases, and the team involved. Follow reputable sources and experts on social media. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, often shares insights on promising projects and trends.

Secure your assets. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Store your cryptocurrencies in hardware wallets rather than exchanges to protect against hacks.

Stay informed. Visit Forbes Advisor, Crypto News, and U.S. News for up-to-date information.

Lastly, only invest money you can afford to lose. The crypto market is unpredictable, and preparing for any outcome is crucial.

Several trends are currently shaping the altcoin market, driving innovation and investment. From NFTs to Layer 2 solutions, these developments are capturing investors' attention.

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have exploded in popularity. They represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as art, music, and virtual real estate. People are buying NFTs for their potential value and status symbol.

Platforms like Solana and Ethereum are leaders in NFT transactions. Artists and creators prefer these networks for their reliability and lower transaction fees. This space is rapidly growing, with major brands and celebrities entering the market. The interest in digital collectibles and ownership rights suggests NFTs aren't just a fad but a significant innovation.

Another trend to watch is Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs. DAOs use blockchain technology to create organizations governed by smart contracts and consensus rather than central authorities, democratizing decision-making.

Popular DAOs like MakerDAO and Uniswap have influenced the DeFi space. Tokens like Ethereum and Polkadot support these frameworks. The transparency and security provided by DAOs can revolutionize industries beyond finance, such as gaming and supply chains. Investors are keen on these projects for their long-term potential.

Layer 2 solutions aim to improve blockchain scalability by processing transactions off the main chain. This approach reduces congestion and fees, and it is essential as mainstream adoption grows.

Projects like Optimism and Arbitrum are leading examples of Layer 2 technologies. Ethereum has benefited significantly from these innovations. The Layer 2 trend is vital for ensuring that blockchain technology can handle increased demand. Crypto Twitter analysts highlight the importance of these solutions for future space growth.

When investing in altcoins, it's essential to understand the legal and regulatory environment.

Regulatory Landscape: Different countries have varying regulations concerning altcoins. For instance, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stringent rules around cryptocurrencies, treating many altcoins as securities.

Compliance: Altcoin projects must often meet KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. This ensures better transparency and helps prevent illegal activities.

Security: Investors should be cautious about the security measures of altcoin projects. Regulatory bodies sometimes mandate stringent security protocols to safeguard investor funds.

Tax Implications: Trading altcoins can have tax consequences. Financial gains from altcoin investments are often subject to capital gains tax. It's crucial to consult with a tax advisor to understand these implications fully.

Legal Risks: Altcoin projects can face legal challenges, particularly if they fail to comply with the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Legal scrutiny can affect the value and stability of the altcoin.

Market News: Recently, regulatory updates have been a hot topic on Crypto Twitter, with industry experts like Anthony Pompliano discussing potential impacts. He stated, ""Navigating the regulatory landscape is crucial for the future of altcoins and their adoption.""

Project Transparency: Look for projects that are transparent about their regulatory compliance. Projects like Ethereum have clear communication channels, informing investors about regulatory developments.

Legal and regulatory considerations are crucial in the viability and stability of altcoin investments. Always stay informed about the latest regulations affecting the sector.

Keeping altcoins secure is essential. Both online and offline methods are available, each with its benefits.

Hot Wallets: These wallets are connected to the internet and easily accessible. Examples include mobile and web wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.

Cold Wallets are offline wallets that offer added security. Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor are popular choices.

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, said, ""Using a hardware wallet is the safest way to store your crypto assets.""

CZ, CEO of Binance, also emphasizes the importance of security: ""Users should always enable 2FA and avoid sharing their private keys.""

Recent reports highlight that major exchanges like Binance are enhancing security measures following hacks targeting hot wallets. This underlines the importance of using both hot and cold storage to protect your altcoins effectively.

Ensuring the safety of altcoins involves a mix of good practices and using the right tools. This makes it crucial for investors to stay updated and vigilant.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1724781913/Whats_App_Image_2024_08_27_at_18_56_40_266b6db652.jpg,0.5529411764705883
"Next Bull Run Coins As Donald Trump, JD Vance Form Pro Crypto Presidential Ticket",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/08/next-bull-run-coins-as-donald-trump-jd-vance-form-pro-crypto-presidential-ticket,2024-08-16,cryptodaily.co.uk,"The upcoming US presidential election has spotlighted cryptocurrencies like never before. Trump's embrace of cryptocurrencies at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville has convinced crypto investors that a Trump win is good for the crypto market. Suddenly, the US elections are a focal point for the market's next direction.

And, as the political landscape shifts and Trump leads the polls, investors are keenly watching the markets, looking for the best coins to buy ahead of the US elections.

In this guide, we'll list and review some of the best crypto coins you need to consider buying before the November US presidential elections.

Best Cryptos to Buy Ahead of the US Elections - Top 9 List

Here is the top 9 list of the best cryptos to buy ahead of the US elections.

Best Altcoins To Buy Ahead Of The US Presidential Elections

To learn more and make the best investment decision, we have researched each coin to buy ahead of the US presidential elections.

Bitcoin - The Largest Cryptocurrency In The World By Market Capitalization

First on our list is the OG cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, which remains the undisputed cryptocurrency market leader and the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its influence is so pervasive that its movements often dictate the broader market trends.

Recently, the prospect of a Trump and JD Vance pro-crypto administration has added a layer of intrigue to Bitcoin's future, making it a fine investment option to buy ahead of the US presidential elections.

Despite market fluctuations, Bitcoin's dominance is evident, with many viewing it as digital gold and the currency of the future. And, as the election heats up, any pro-crypto stance by major candidates could catalyze a significant bull run, with Bitcoin leading the charge.

Several crypto analysts have also suggested that a Trump victory could spur further institutional investment in Bitcoin, driving its price to new highs. All in all, as long as Trump leads the polls, a Bitcoin investment could be a smart decision to make.

Base Dawgz - Dynamic Dog-Themed Meme Coin

Next on our list is Base Dawgz, a new multi-chain meme coin that is built on Base but natively supported across five blockchains: Base, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Solana. During the Base Dawgz presale, you can buy and claim the $DAWGZ token on all of these networks, and it will also launch on all of them simultaneously.

Base Dawgz is one of the newer meme coins on the block, but it's quickly gaining traction and already has a loyal and active community that's pushing it to new heights. This altcoin launch is expected to be a big deal, and several crypto analysts have already suggested $DAWGZ could be the next 36X meme coin based on the early hype around the token.

The excitement surrounding $DAWGZ is building by the day, thanks to the project's ingenious share-to-earn rewards scheme. Presale participants who link their X account to the Base Dawgz presale and reshare material from the Base Dawgz X account will receive tokens that can be redeemed for $DAWGZ at the end of the presale. It's a great system for rewarding loyal community members and spreading the word about Base Dawgz.

For those who want to join the party, the Base Dawgz presale is open now. It has raised more than $2.9 million in its first few months and at press time, $DAWGZ is trading at just $0.007784 per token.

Overall, this meme coin's lighthearted approach, combined with a robust roadmap, has made it a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts and crypto analysts. As the election nears, Base Dawgz could see a surge in popularity, particularly if meme culture becomes a rallying point for the pro-crypto movement, so this is a meme coin traders won't want to miss.

Buy Base Dawgz

Ethereum - Second Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization

Next on our list is Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value and the dominant platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum's status as a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem has been strengthened by the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The number one altcoin is a global, decentralized software platform that uses perhaps the most sophisticated blockchain technology. It is most known by investors for its native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), and by developers for its usage in the creation of blockchain and decentralized financial applications.

Nearly 40% of Ethereum is now locked up in smart contracts, and its scarcity is becoming more apparent as the amount available for trading decreases. If demand increases, this scarcity could result in large price swings, making Ethereum a coin to watch. Ethereum's price is currently at $2544 per (ETH/USD) and has climbed by around 9.30% in the previous week, nearly 15% YTD, and a 1-year return of 57%.

The upcoming US elections could significantly impact Ethereum. A pro-crypto administration might accelerate regulatory clarity, which could benefit Ethereum's expansive network of dApps. Additionally, Ethereum's upcoming network upgrades, aimed at improving scalability and reducing transaction fees, make it a must-watch token as the election approaches.

The Meme Games - Olympic-Inspired Meme Coin

Next on our list is The Meme Games, another new meme coin that provides gamified presale token benefits through an Olympics-themed sports tournament. $MGMES, The Meme Games' native coin, has recently gone on presale, and every time an investor purchases tokens through the presale, they participate in a gamified presale event.

On this platform, investors can also select one of the five meme coin characters, which include Pepe, Doge, Brett, Wif, and Turbo, to compete in a 169-meter dash race. If their chosen avatar wins the race, they will then receive a 25% presale bonus, and this exciting feature has led to many investors flocking to the presale.

This unique token combines the viral nature of memes with the competitive world of gaming. It's designed to capitalize on the intersection of these two trends, making it a potential hit among younger investors. And as we get closer to the elections, this token could gain momentum, especially if the cultural focus on memes continues to grow.

In just a few weeks, The Meme Games has raised more than $365k, which suggests a rise in investor interest. The Meme Games presale is scheduled to end right after the Paris Olympics 2024 season ends, and $MGMES will launch on DEX on September 10, 2024. This has led many analysts to set high price expectations for the Meme Games token, with some analysts claiming it's the coin to buy right now.

Currently, $MGMES is trading at a discount price of just $0.00925 per token on presale, and it can be bought in exchange for ETH, USDT, and BNB, as well as directly through a debit or credit bank card.

Notably, 38% of the total 2.024 billion token supply is being distributed through the presale, which will ensure that early adopters get a share of this token.

Next is Avalanche, a highly liquid blockchain player with a large market capitalization. It offers a more scalable, interoperable, and decentralized infrastructure for developing decentralized apps (dApps) and carrying out smart contracts, although it takes a different approach than existing ""layer two"" solutions.

Technically, Avalanche provides so-called subnets, which are child chains of the Avalanche C-chain. This allows it to simply build a dedicated blockchain for various use cases, as demonstrated by DeFi Kingdoms and Shrapnel, two of the largest web3 gaming projects. Its primary use case is for high-throughput, scalable blockchain solutions, and it has been used by several projects seeking powerful decentralized platforms.

In terms of price performance, AVAX had a volatile year in 2024, with a YTD return of -49%; however, its 1-year return still stands at an impressive figure of 90%.

Despite its poor performance in 2024, AVAX is still among the best coins to buy right now. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that promises high throughput and low latency, making it a popular choice for developers and enterprises alike. Its focus on scalability and environmental sustainability sets it apart from many of its competitors. The pro-crypto stance of a Trump and JD Vance ticket could be a boon for Avalanche, especially if it leads to increased institutional adoption. With its rapid transaction speeds and growing ecosystem, Avalanche is well-positioned to benefit from any positive political developments.

Additionally, Avalanche is set to introduce blockchain to new developers through hackathons. The project announced through its X platform that starting this month; it would be hosting the Avalanche Vietnam Game Jam 2024, where it would invite game developers (solo and teams) to come to showcase their skills. Participants will network with professionals in the industry, participate in targeted seminars, learn about blockchain development, and compete for prizes worth over $20k.

Overall, Avalanche is certainly one of the best cryptos to buy ahead of the US elections in November.

Shiba Shootout - CowBoy-Themed Meme Coin

Shiba Shootout is another meme coin but with a twist. It combines elements of gaming with the meme coin trend, creating a unique value proposition for its users. The token's community-driven approach has helped it carve out a niche in the crowded crypto market. And as the US elections draw near, Shiba Shootout could see increased interest, particularly from younger, tech-savvy voters who are drawn to this altcoin.

On this cowboy-themed platform, users can share their engaging stories about meme coin experiences through the 'Campfire Stories' mode, and the most interesting storytellers will be rewarded with $SHIBASHOOT, the native token. And this token can be used to purchase tickets and participate in internal lotteries. The token can also be staked on Shiba Shootout to generate an APY as high as 1,000% from a total supply of 2.2 billion tokens, where 20% of the token will be allocated through staking rewards. So far, over 32 million tokens have already been staked on Shiba Shootout, and this will ensure low selling pressure when this meme coin launches. As a matter of fact, many crypto experts are quite excited about the benefits of using Shiba Shootout, claiming it's an excellent choice for making passive income.

At press time, $SHIBASHOOT is priced at $0.0199 per token during it's presale. This presale has raised more than $946k within a few months and this indicates strong investor demand, mostly dure to various earning options members can achieve by joining this platform.

The multiple-earning opportunities this altcoin provides are one of the reasons Shiba Shootout has made this list of the best altcoins to buy before the US presidential election.

Pepe Unchained is a new token that leverages the popularity of the original Pepe the Frog meme. Despite its controversial origins, the meme has become a staple of internet culture, and Pepe Unchained seeks to capitalize on that. The token's appeal lies in its ability to tap into a vast and engaged online community. As the political climate shifts, Pepe Unchained could ride the wave of meme-driven enthusiasm, particularly if the pro-crypto rhetoric gains steam.

This Pepe-inspired meme coin that is built on the Ethereum layer-two (L2) blockchain enables increased network efficiency and lower expenses. Simplyput, Pepe Unchained speeds up transaction processing by offloading them from the main network.

So far, Pepe Unchained has attracted huge interest from investors, raising nearly $9M in several months. The primary reason is that Pepe Unchained aims to build a brand-new Layer-2 network, not just any Layer-2 network, but one specifically designed for meme coins. Pepe Unchained's team is making some big promises, like being 100 times faster than Ethereum, complete with a dedicated block explorer and instant bridging to Ethereum. What's more, $PEPU, the native token, can be staked on smart contracts to generate a live APY (Annual percentage yield) of more than 200%.

If the team can deliver on their promise of drastically lowering transaction costs, we might be looking at a future hub for meme coins, and this is one of the reasons Pepe Unchained has made it to our list. Some analysts believe it has a potential to soar up to 100x after launch.

In sum, Pepe Unchained is clearly one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy ahead of the US elections due to its promising presale launch. Within a few months, the presale has raised more nearly $9 million, and the buzz online continues.

At the time of writing, $PEPU is priced at $0.0090901 per token and can be bought directly on the Pepe Unchained presale page. For additional information, visit the company's official presale page below.

Another altcoin on our list is PlayDoge, a fun and interactive cryptocurrency that's focused on bringing gaming and digital assets together. Its user-friendly approach has made it a hit among gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. And, with the US elections on the horizon, PlayDoge could see a surge in popularity, particularly if the pro-crypto narrative gains traction among younger voters.

This meme coin is based on the BNB Smart Chain, and the project combines two cult groups, meme giant Doge and the Tamagotchi gaming juggernaut. This creates a great play-to-earn (P2E) game where users may earn $PLAY tokens by raising a digital pet. The project has already garnered up to $6 million through its presale, demonstrating the hype around the PlayDoge concept.

What truly differentiates PlayDoge in the crypto world is its innovative approach to personalized Doge ownership. The forthcoming mobile game lets users adopt and care for a virtual Shiba Inu, and players can train, feed, and play with their digital pets while earning the native token, $PLAY. Unlike Tamagotchi, which was purely for fun, PlayDoge adds a financial element, making it addictive with real-world rewards and incentivizing players to continue.

And, as many investors join the platform, analysts predict huge growth for its token, $PLAY.

Currently, $PLAY is trading at just $0.00529 per token and is one of the main coins to watch for ahead of the US presidential election and beyond. There is no official end date for the PlayDoge presale, so investors interested in this crypto can keep updated tabs on the project by following its X channel.

Mega Dice Token is a popular casino-themed cryptocurrency that's gaining attention for its unique approach to online gambling. The token allows users to participate in various casino games with the potential to win big. As the pro-crypto presidential ticket gains momentum, altcoins like Mega Dice could see increased interest, especially if regulatory clarity is achieved. The combination of gambling and cryptocurrency is a potent mix, making Mega Dice tokens one you want to invest in.

This popular crypto casino, which is based on the Solana network, combines two of today's most popular trends: Solana coins and a new gameplay style known as GambleFi. With over 50,000 players and over 10,000 monthly active users, MegaDice is quite a promising crypto projects. With that in mind, some analysts and crypto expert claim it has a 1000x potential.

And the numbers so far look good. The ongoing presale has raised over $1.7 million in a few months into the presale, with one $DICE up for grabs for only $0.105266. With such a large user base in the Mega Dice casino, the projections of $1.3 by the end of 2025 seem realistic.

The $DICE token provides genuine benefits, such as cashback when playing at casinos, free tokens via airdrops, and exclusive prizes from NFTs. Investors can also earn a 10% referral commission (with no limit) on the amount invested by someone they referred. Moreover, the casino has an exciting $2.25M airdrop divided into three seasons, and the $DICE season 3 airdrop just went live.

In sum, investors looking to hop on this project that is on its way to being a very successful gaming token can also purchase this token with $TON, as MegaDice now supports the top telegram wallet. You can join X or join its Telegram channel to keep up with the latest presale updates, or visit its official presale page below.

How a Trump Win Can Impact Cryptocurrency Prices

As things stand, the potential impact of a Trump and JD Vance victory on the cryptocurrency market is quite clear. Both figures have expressed positive views towards digital assets, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the US and globally. This shift could encourage more institutional investment in the space, driving up the prices of top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, and others.

It all started with Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Trump's comment 'If We Don't Do It, China Will', has changed the perception toward the crypto market. Now, it seems like a political race. And, if Trump wins, then the race begins, and when the race begins, crypto prices might rise again.

In short, with Donald Trump and JD Vance forming a pro-crypto presidential ticket, the future of digital assets looks promising. Moreover, a pro-crypto administration could lead to the development of new blockchain technologies, further boosting the market.

Final Word

To sum up, as the US presidential elections approach, the cryptocurrency market is poised for significant developments. With a potential pro-crypto administration on the horizon, the future looks bright for digital assets. However, you need to follow the polls and keep an eye on the best cryptos to buy right now.

Besides Bitcoin, traders should also consider buying altcoins such as those mentioned in our guide. For diversification, these include top-tier crypto coins such as Avalanche and Ethereum, along with cryptocurrencies in a presale stage, including The Meme Games, Pepe Unchained, PlayDoge, Base Dawgz, Shiba Shooutout, and the Mega Dice Token.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,315.67, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart above is pulling data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum reached a 52-week intraday high of $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024, and a 52-week intraday low of $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has a global market capitalization of $278.62 billion. Year over year, ETH has increased 43%.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $278.62 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $75.61 billion, XRP at $53.13 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.28 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $278.62 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $307 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $299 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,315.67.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 43% year over year, compared to a 114% gain for bitcoin.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

Crypto Hack: Indonesia's Indodax Goes Offline After Suspected $22M Breach | Bitcoin Ethereum | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/606c3-crypto-hack-indonesias-indodax-goes-offline-after-suspected-22m-breach,2024-09-11,CryptoRank,"Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange Indodax is the latest to fall victim to a hack, resulting in the theft of approximately $22 million in digital assets.

According to a post by blockchain security firm SlowMist on X, the hackers stole digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), multiple ERC-20 tokens from the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, TRX and USDT tokens from the Tron (TRX) blockchain, Polygon (POL), and ETH from the Optimism (OP) blockchain. The total loss is estimated to be around $22 million.

Indodax confirmed the hack and has temporarily paused all platform operations due to ""maintenance"" activities. The trading platform has assured its users that their crypto funds are safe. The exchange said:

Currently, we are conducting a complete maintenance to ensure the entire system is operating properly. During this maintenance process, the INDODAX web platform and application are temporarily inaccessible.

Founded in 2014, Indodax primarily serves the Indonesian crypto market and recorded a total trading volume of slightly more than $11 million in the past 24 hours.

SlowMist's analysis ruled out any possible hot wallet hack. Rather, the blockchain security firm notes that it is possible that Indodax's withdrawal system was compromised, which gave hackers access to the exchange's hot wallet and the ability to withdraw funds seamlessly.

Similarly, digital assets security firm Cyvers noticed ""multiple suspicious transactions involving wallets on different networks."" The wallet address suspected of orchestrating the hack could be observed swapping different tokens to ETH. While it remains to be seen what the hacker's next moves will be, they typically leverage cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash to obscure the trail of their crypto transactions.

Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Indodax has sufficient reserves to compensate for the lost funds. At press time, Indodax's total financial reserves are worth $367 million, and the bulk of their funds are distributed among digital currencies such as BTC, ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and USDT. However, data from Arkham Intelligence estimates the total figure to be even higher, at $409 million.

Yosi Hammer, head of AI at Cyvers told BSCN that the characteristics and patterns of the Indodax hack closely resemble those of the notorious North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

Close followers of the crypto industry would know of Lazarus, the infamous hacking group responsible for executing multiple high-profile hacks over the past few years. For instance, the recent hack of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX is linked to Lazarus, which resulted in a loss of $234 million in user funds.

A recent report by Immunefi noted that hackers are keeping up with advances in security in the crypto industry as the value of total stolen funds has increased by 15.5% compared to 2023 for the same period. BTC trades at $56,701 at press time, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

Five crypto market predictions that haven't come true  --  yet,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-prediction-nfts-privacy-metaverse-bitcoin,2024-08-30,Cointelegraph,"Success in crypto trading often hinges on a deep understanding of fundamentals, sharp technical analysis skills, or access to market intelligence.

However, the driving force behind price movement frequently comes down to market narratives.

These stories about the market may or may not be fundamentally sound, but respecting them is crucial for success in crypto investing.

There's also a catch: narratives often emerge with force but can just as quickly fade away.

In 2024, several crypto narratives have taken center stage.

Memecoins are one of the most peculiar trends, thriving on hype, humor and strong online communities despite lacking intrinsic value or any real utility. These tokens often attract quick-profit seekers, but their longevity remains in question.

More serious narratives, such as the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization -- both of which aim to solve actual problems -- have also appeared.

DePINs focus on decentralizing infrastructure like energy grids using blockchain, while RWA tokenization refers to tokenizing assets like real estate and commodities. Experts predict tokenized RWAs could unlock a $30 trillion market, although that is yet to materialize.

The dominant narrative is the approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The ETFs provide a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, encouraging institutional adoption and legitimizing the market. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF alone has acquired over $20 billion in BTC, fueling optimism and market growth.

As these narratives evolve, the past shows that many trends tend to fade away or fall short of expectations, and Cointelegraph has taken a look at five major market narratives that have yet to pan out.

Lightning Network will make Bitcoin a viable currency for payments

In the 2008 Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to be a digital currency independent of central banks and institutions:

""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.""

One big headwind hampering Bitcoin's use as a payment currency is the network's slow transaction speeds.

Visa can handle 24,000 transactions per second (TPS), Mastercard can perform 5,000, and Bitcoin can currently handle a maximum of seven. The dramatic differences between these digital payment platforms prove that Bitcoin should find a solution to its transaction speeds to become a viable payment currency.

The Lightning Network (LN) is one such solution.

Lightning is a layer-2 protocol developed on the Bitcoin blockchain that can process payments in a parallel, faster, lighter network to remove traffic from the main blockchain. Theoretically, the LN can send 1,000,000 TPS and settle all of them instantly.

Lightning adoption has grown as its number of nodes has increased, and crypto exchanges have adopted the technology. Expectations for Lightning to make Bitcoin a viable payment currency were high, but it hasn't yet lived up to its hype.

Lightning has encountered challenges related to privacy concerns and issues with network liquidity, which add an extra layer of technical complexity to using cryptocurrencies and hinder global adoption.

The L2 solution hasn't failed but needs improvement to handle payments worldwide.

Blockchain is the solution to everything

""Put it on a blockchain"" has long been a term in the business world for hyping something up without providing any real benefits.

The 2017 crypto bull run and initial coin offering boom introduced cryptocurrencies to the broader public.

Blockchain was rapidly promoted as a technology that could solve the issues of any business sector.

Blockchain would improve global distribution systems, eliminate governmental corruption, tamper-proof elections, provide digital identity, establish intellectual property rights -- and the list goes on.

During the 2017 crypto bull run, blockchain became a buzzword as businesses tried to use versions of the technology to improve sectors or to attract attention.

Projects such as PetChain, which used blockchain to track household pets, and Dentacoin, which aimed to create a decentralized ecosystem to improve different aspects of dental care, were some of the more unusual use cases for blockchain.

The hype surrounding blockchain overshadowed its benefits, leading to many projects that often lacked real-world utility. As the dust settled, it became clear that blockchain can address specific challenges, but not every problem requires a blockchain solution.

NFT dream of digital ownership

Non-fungible tokens surged in January 2021, receiving mainstream attention in March 2021, when crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi purchased Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million. Currently, the best offer for this NFT is just over $2,000 or 0.8 Ether (ETH) at current prices, according to OpenSea.

NFTs provided the technical possibility of proving ownership over digital content. This was revolutionary, as it could transform several sectors and create a marketplace for gaming assets and digital collectibles.

NFTs purported to solve a problem for digital artists who could have their artwork easily duplicated or stolen. The token would offer proof of ownership, and the artwork would be included in its minting.

The emergence of a new digital market produced one of the craziest hype cycles in the history of crypto, where buyers bought into a craze to be the first holders of certain NFTs.

Millions of dollars went into NFT collections and computer-generated profile picture (PFP) collections, with only slight differences. The madness peaked, but nowadays, NFTs are being sold for heavy losses.

The reasons for the downfall of NFTs could be related to the use of NFTs for wash trading, the lack of copyright protections provided, and the numerous scams that tarnished their public image, eventually scaring off investors.

Despite the mainstream public associating NFTs with monkey profile pictures, they still offer many potential real-world use cases.

In real estate, they could track historical ownership, while in academics, they can enable immutable certificate verification. Anti-forgery systems for the ticketing sector and new approaches to digital identity and reputation management could be developed through NFT variations like soulbond tokens proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

These applications will only be implemented if NFTs achieve legal backing or widespread acceptance from markets and consumers.

The metaverse will provide a new frontier for social interactions

In 1985, Lucasfilm's Habitat -- a video game for the Commodore 64 -- provided the first example of a virtual cyberspace where users could interact.

Seven years later, in 1992, Neal Stephenson coined the term ""metaverse"" in his novel Snow Crash.

In the 1990s, the metaverse appeared poised to become a reality with the emergence of virtual reality (VR) headsets, heralded as a technological revolution. However, the market was overhyped and didn't gain mainstream traction, mainly due to technological limitations.

However, recent advancements in augmented reality (AR), VR headsets and faster internet bandwidth reignited interest in the metaverse.

The big moment came when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's rebranding to Meta and promised a commitment to investing and developing the metaverse.

The metaverse's crypto narrative revolves around creating a decentralized, immersive digital universe where users can interact, create and transact in a virtual space. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies offered the possibility of enabling true digital ownership and interoperability, as well as potentially developing new digital economic systems.

Like the NFT craze, a flood of money went into metaverse projects using blockchain. Virtual real estate was sold for astronomical amounts of money, such as the 116 digital ""land"" parcels sold for $2.4 million.

However, the sudden rush into leading metaverse platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland was short-lived.

Despite raising millions, DappRadar data indicates that Decentraland has around 300 daily active users, while The Sandbox has about 200.

The metaverse investment hype may have arrived too early. An underdeveloped product failed to meet gameplay expectations and ultimately bored users. Meta lost $16 billion in 2023 and continues to lose money on its metaverse investments. With new technological enhancements, a profitable and active metaverse could yet emerge -- only time will tell.

Privacy coins will catch on as people want to transact privately

Contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrencies do not inherently provide total anonymity. Most operate on a public blockchain, which offers pseudonymity at best -- privacy coins aimed to fix this.

Leading privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) were created to preserve anonymity in financial transactions and ensure financial privacy.

These coins surged in the 2017 bull run and made a comeback in 2021. As regulators fixed their eyes on privacy coins, there was renewed interest in them.

However, it looks like regulatory forces are winning the battle so far.

Privacy coins have been stigmatized due to constant regulatory pressure over their association with illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion.

Despite the price surges in 2017 and 202, many exchanges began to delist privacy coins in 2022 to avoid regulatory backlash as pressure mounted, severely limited liquidity and accessibility.

Law enforcement capabilities have also evolved with the improvement of advanced forensic tools and blockchain analytics firms that can track certain transactions. Although Monero wasn't cracked, the fact that other privacy coins could be tracked weakened their selling point of being completely untraceable.

Furthermore, most common crypto users feel safe enough with the pseudonymity offered by mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, with proposals for them to become more private, reducing the appeal of niche privacy coins.","https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-08/0191a388-5cd5-7fa3-b646-cd00a81cfad1",0.2549019607843137
Revolutionising The Gaming And Web3 Landscape: The Impact Of Portal Pay,https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/revolutionising-gaming-web3-landscape-impact-portal-pay-1726355,2024-08-20,International Business Times UK,"Portal Pay is a revolutionary payment solution designed to transform the gaming industry

In the ever-evolving world of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the need for seamless interoperability and enhanced user experiences is more pressing than ever. Portal Pay, the latest innovation from Portal, addresses these needs with a revolutionary payment solution designed to transform the gaming experience, empower developers, and significantly impact the broader Web3 ecosystem.

Pay marks a significant delivery point at the beginning of our impressive upcoming product roadmap, with all transaction fees from Pay being used to buy the token. Here's an in-depth look at how Portal Pay sets new standards and paves the way for gaming monetisation's future.

Portal Pay introduces an unprecedented level of interoperability in blockchain gaming. One of the space's biggest challenges is the fragmented nature of digital assets and the users who hold them across different chains, games, and platforms. With it, users can seamlessly transact with any token from any chain.

This capability simplifies asset management and enhances the overall gaming experience by enabling seamless transfers of assets and currencies between games. For example, imagine encountering an opponent in-game and needing additional tools or boosts to beat them. In-game Portal Pay makes this possible, removing the hassle of leaving the game to approve transactions and buy items. Portal Pay addresses significant pain points in the gaming industry, ensuring gamers no longer must deal with the hassle of managing multiple wallets since it lets users buy in whatever currency they want. This level of interoperability and improved UX are game-changers, allowing users to transact in up to 5,000 currencies and coins with only a single tap on the screen.

This feature offers unprecedented flexibility in cryptocurrency payments. It means universal acceptance, allowing users to pay using any cryptocurrency they own, regardless of the blockchain it's on. Cross-chain compatibility means the system handles the complexity of cross-chain transactions behind the scenes.

Developer flexibility allows game developers and merchants to receive payments in their preferred currency, which might differ from what the user pays with. This reduces friction, as users don't need to own specific tokens for specific games or platforms. It broadens market reach by enabling games to attract users from various blockchain ecosystems without requiring them to acquire new tokens or wallets.

The platform supports cross-chain transactions, allowing users to move their assets seamlessly between blockchain networks. This feature is particularly beneficial in a rapidly growing multi-chain environment where interoperability is becoming increasingly important. Portal Pay's integration with significant blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain means Portal's reach and scope expand to games and players native to those spaces.

As the network grows, Portal's efficiency and use case are only further highlighted and affirmed as integration with significant blockchain networks also provides better liquidity options for more players in farther-reaching geo-locations.

For game developers, Portal Pay offers a suite of tools and features that streamline the integration of blockchain technology into their games. One of the significant challenges developers face is ensuring compatibility with various blockchain protocols. Its interoperability provides a unified platform that supports multiple blockchain networks, allowing developers to reach a broader audience without dealing with the complexities of integrating different blockchains.

The platform also offers robust support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have become a critical component of the gaming industry. Developers can easily incorporate NFTs into their games, creating unique in-game items, collectables, and rewards that enhance player engagement and open new monetisation opportunities. The comprehensive API and developer tools simplify NFTs' creation, management, and trading, empowering developers to innovate and deliver richer gaming experiences.

Additionally, the platform's ability to support multiple blockchain networks means developers can build games catering to a broader audience.

How to Pick the Best Cryptos for Day Trading

While the crypto market seems very attractive for day trading, given the vast selection of assets, there are certain aspects that must be kept in mind before day trading cryptocurrencies.

1. Volatility

Day traders look for significant short-term price fluctuations to maximize profit opportunities, making cryptocurrencies with higher volatility more desirable for their strategies. Although most cryptocurrencies display varying levels of volatility, understanding key fundamentals -- such as market capitalization -- is crucial. Smaller market cap tokens often experience more dramatic swings compared to their larger counterparts.

2. Trading Volume

Larger trading volumes define healthier market conditions and more predictable price swings that tend to follow a logic of technical analysis.

3. Liquidity

Day traders must pick crypto assets that can be easily sold for fiat, stablecoins or any other coins. High-liquid cryptos allow faster execution of trades.

4. Market Depth

A deeper market indicates a more liquid and active market. It allows larger trade sizes without significantly affecting the slippage risks and the prices.

5. Utility

When day trading, the utility of a cryptocurrency can be an important consideration. Cryptocurrencies with specific, targeted use cases may exhibit lower correlation with broader market trends. For instance, Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi sector and Polkadot's focus on interoperability highlight how distinct functionalities can influence price behavior and create unique trading opportunities.

Conclusion

Selecting the right asset is crucial for success in day trading. While we've highlighted some top choices, it's essential to monitor market trends, conduct thorough research, and stay informed about the latest news and developments.

Day trading carries inherent risks, so effective risk management is key to trading responsibly.

Unlike stock markets, which operate during specific hours on business days, the crypto market never closes. This continuous trading allows day traders to capitalize on opportunities at any time, adapting quickly to market fluctuations and breaking news. Additionally, the high volatility and liquidity in the crypto market can provide more frequent and substantial profit opportunities for day traders.

3. Where can I trade cryptocurrencies on daily basis?

Individuals can trade cryptocurrencies daily on major crypto exchanges. Mudrex stands out as an excellent platform for cryptocurrency trading, offering a user-friendly and intuitive interface.","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-113123665,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-18178,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",0.2784313725490195
Is Ethereum a Good Investment?,https://thefutureofthings.com/22639-is-ethereum-a-good-investment/,2024-08-20,TFOT,"As distributed ledger technology strives to transform industries, decentralize authority, and foster greater transparency, Ethereum has quickly established itself as one of the most promising digital assets driving this transformation. For those looking to diversify their crypto holdings, the option to swap BTC to ETH offers a strategic way to participate in Ethereum's growth potential. However, like any speculative venture, significant risks coexist with substantial opportunities. Assessing Ethereum's long-term investment viability requires a comprehensive analysis of the enduring value derived from its core utility and practical applications.

In contrast to Bitcoin's singular focus on digital payments and value preservation, Ethereum serves as a multifaceted asset powering an ecosystem of decentralized software. Ether tokens fuel a platform for creating and operating decentralized applications (dapps). Developers leverage Ethereum's programming language to construct smart contracts that deploy on its blockchain, enabling dapp functionality to execute as intended without the risk of censorship or manipulation.

These decentralized applications span diverse sectors, reimagining incentive structures and innovation potential across critical industries. Both global corporations and startups are taking note of these possibilities.

Upcoming enhancements such as sharding, proof-of-stake consensus, layer 2 scaling solutions, and more aim to enable Ethereum's blockchain to process upwards of 100,000 transactions per second at minimal cost. This positions the network to support billions of users and facilitate trillions in value transfer across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, metaverse realms, and Web 3.0 applications.

As more enterprise and consumer-focused dapps are developed and adopted, this will provide intrinsic value to Ether itself. The long-term investment outlook appears promising for those who believe in the future of decentralized applications.

Several critical factors suggest that Ethereum adoption will continue to accelerate rapidly:

As core protocol development and dapp innovation systematically address current platform limitations while broadening access for developers and consumers to build and use Ethereum apps, the network appears well-positioned to capture escalating value.

Naturally, prudent crypto investors must consider the short-term volatility and longer-term uncertainty inherent to an early-stage asset like Ether. Monitoring potential shifts in crypto policies, regulations, and taxation warrants attention as the technology matures.

Further delays or complications could impede the rollout of upgrades like the transition to proof-of-stake, necessitating caution around projected timelines. Yet Ethereum now boasts a substantial track record of resilience, security, and antifragility compared to earlier blockchain iterations. The global grassroots community of builders and users continues gaining momentum and sophistication in tandem with the technological evolution.

While Ethereum currently leads decentralized app platforms, competitive threats remain. Alternative Layer 1 blockchains like Solana (SOL) aim to capture Ethereum's market share given their significant transaction speed advantages over Ethereum at present.

Solana prioritizes scalability and rapid innovation cycles to maintain its edge in raw throughput over ETH - already demonstrating the capacity to handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum's 15 TPS currently.

If you're considering adding Solana to your portfolio and wondering how to swap SOL to ETH, understanding these differences and the potential risks and rewards of each blockchain is essential.

However, Solana's extreme focus on speed comes at the expense of much lower security thresholds presently and higher network instability risks. It also has far fewer live applications or active users compared to Ethereum at this time.

This competition showcases contrasting philosophies -- Solana's appetite for rapid composability against Ethereum's emphasis on security and measured upgrades.

For investors bullish on Solana maintaining raw speed advantages over Ethereum long-term, the substantial upside from its still nascent $35 billion market cap compared to ETH's formidable $250 billion+ valuation may warrant including some Solana exposure alongside core Ethereum holdings, if managed judiciously.

Based on its growth trajectory, prominent crypto thought leaders and institutional analysts across firms like Ark Invest, Bloomberg, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital share an overwhelmingly optimistic outlook on Ethereum's price appreciation potential over 5-10 year horizons.

Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital believes Ether could surpass $7,500 per token by 2025 as financialization accelerates and DeFi platforms built on Ethereum gain escape velocity.

A Bloomberg analyst projected Ethereum reaching a total market cap between $20-30 trillion eventually, which would translate to $14,000 - $20,000 per ETH token.

ARK Invest analysts forecast Ethereum hitting $20,000+ ultimately based on expected massive innovation and growth in DeFi, NFTs, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), stablecoins, and Web 3.0 built largely on Ethereum over the coming decade.

Clearly, experts envision 10-100x or greater upside from current prices over the next decade, requiring the total crypto market cap to exceed $100 trillion. Such lofty predictions may seem far-fetched, but they underscore the potential for transformative technologies to reshape entire industries and generate immense value.

Despite the volatility, early-stage cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have monumental wealth creation potential comparable to historical paradigm shifts like the Internet over decades. Investors with sufficient due diligence and conviction around decentralized networks disrupting entrenched business models stand to generate substantial returns over long time horizons.

Based on accelerating real-world traction and infrastructure maturation, Ethereum appears well-positioned to emerge as the definitive blockchain settlement layer and decentralized application ecosystem over the next decade -- with highly favorable odds of delivering generational wealth creation for believers in its paradigm shift.

Of course, risks ranging from delays in key upgrades to unforeseen protocol vulnerabilities to competitive displacement threats could severely impair returns. Hence, assessing individual risk tolerance and managing crypto allocations prudently remains vital.

Yet for those willing to endure the stomach-churning fluctuations, Ethereum represents a rare opportunity to potentially achieve extraordinary rewards over a sufficiently long time horizon. As with any transformative technology, the journey will be tumultuous, but the potential payoffs could be life-altering for those who invest wisely and maintain conviction through the turbulence.",https://thefutureofthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pexels-davidmcbee-730552.jpg,0.419607843137255
11 critical moments in Ethereum's history that made it the No.2 blockchain,https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/11-critical-moments-ethereum-history-that-made-eth-no2-blockchain/,2024-08-19,Cointelegraph,"Nine years after Ethereum launched, we look back on the critical turning points that has seen ETH become the second most popular cryptocurrency.

The history of Ethereum began more than a decade ago as a gleam in the eye of its creator, Vitalik Buterin, a gangly math genius frustrated by the limitations of Bitcoin who believed he could do something better with a blockchain.

Instead of cryptocurrency being solely a monetary asset, Buterin envisioned extending blockchain technology to the point where it became a ""global computer"" -- a platform that hosts decentralized applications, powered by smart contracts, with minimal need for human intervention or trust assumptions.

Fast forward to today, and Ethereum is the second-largest crypto asset in the world, underpinning a trillion-dollar ecosystem of dependent networks. It's the blockchain of choice for several of the world's largest asset managers, as well as hundreds of thousands of daily users on the layer 1 and millions on connected L2s.

Here are 11 of the most important moments in Ethereum's history and some of the big upgrades to look forward to.

The Ethereum white paper -- 2013

Buterin was first introduced to Bitcoin in his late teens by his father, a Russian-born engineer who immigrated with his family to Canada.

With little in the way of funds to invest in Bitcoin mining or the asset itself, Buterin worked as a crypto blog writer and received payments in BTC during the early 2010s.

Noticing his talent as a leading thinker and author in the field, Romanian Bitcoin enthusiast Mihai Alisie approached him, and the pair launched Bitcoin Magazine in 2012.

A year later, in 2013, when he was just 19 years old, Buterin published the Ethereum white paper outlining a ""next-generation smart contract and decentralized application platform."" The aim was simply to fix Bitcoin's ""too limited functionality"" he told Business Insider:

""Think of the difference between something like a pocket calculator and a smartphone, where a pocket calculator does one thing and it does one thing well, but really people want to do all these other things. And if you have a smartphone then on the smartphone you have a pocket calculator as an app. You have playing music as an app. You have a web browser as an app and pretty much everything else.""

He was later awarded $100,000 by the Peter Thiel Fellowship to begin working on the Ethereum platform.

The Red Wedding -- 2014

Before Ethereum became what it is today, it suffered through some growing pains and conflict, the first major one being the infamous ""Red Wedding"" -- where the future of the network was thrown into the hands of Buterin.

As Camila Russo documented in her book, The Infinite Machine, the team of co-founders had gathered in Zug, Switzerland on June 7, 2014, to sign a document that would transform Ethereum into a for-profit company.

But instead of signing the contract, tensions concerning Charles Hoskinson's management style, Amir Chetrit's contributions to the project and Ethereum's future direction reached a boiling point.

The call for which way Ethereum should go was left to Buterin, who moved to oust Hoskinson (who went on to create Cardano) and Chetrit and establish Ethereum as a nonprofit foundation instead of a company.

""We had differences of opinion, at times, those differences of opinion boiled over famously... infamously,"" fellow Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin told Magazine in 2023.

ICO and launch -- 2014

The next major step for Ethereum was raising capital and sparking widespread public awareness during its initial coin offering in 2014, selling millions of dollars worth of ETH to fund the development of the project.

Between July 22 and Sept. 2, 2014, the ICO saw investors snap up more than $18 million worth of ETH, which they paid for with BTC.

The Ethereum blockchain and its native token, ETH, were officially launched on July 30, 2015.

ETH hit the market with a value of $0.31 per ETH token, marking an impressive 1,057,000% return for anyone lucky enough to hold their ETH until today's price of $3,275.

Nobody knows for sure, of course, but Ethereum and Consensys co-founder Joe Lubin is rumored to have invested more in the ICO than anyone else.

The DAO hack and Ethereum Classic -- 2016

Arguably the most formative event in Ethereum's history was the now-infamous hack of The DAO, an exploit where hackers stole more than 3.6 million ETH from the early, idealistic The Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

The attack sent shockwaves through the market, sending the price of ETH plummeting from $20 to $9 in less than 36 hours.

Divided on how to proceed in the wake of the attack, the Ethereum community split into two main camps: One wanted to keep going, business as usual, and the other wanted to roll back the network to before the attack occurred to fix the issue.

It was a philosophical split: Should blockchains be immutable records, with code as law, or can their leaders simply change history to erase inconvenient episodes? There were passionate arguments on both sides, and the debate over whether Ethereum took the correct path continues to this day.

Ultimately, the majority of the Ethereum community voted in favor of hard forking the network to wind back the blockchain and regain the assets lost in the exploit.

One of the hard forks is the proof-of-stake blockchain that still holds the Ethereum name to this day, while the other is called Ethereum Classic -- technically the original version of the Ethereum blockchain, which remains a proof-of-work blockchain.

CryptoKitties breaks Ethereum -- 2017

One of the strangest things to happen to Ethereum was the advent of the non-fungible token collection CryptoKitties, which more or less broke the network.

Launched in October 2017 by the Vancouver-based venture studio Axiom Zen, CryptoKitties was designed as an earnest and fun experiment with blockchain tech, allowing users to collect and breed different types of NFTs.

By early December, CryptoKitties had gone giga-viral, sending prices for the NFTs as high as $170,000. The demand and activity around Kitties were so high that they clogged the Ethereum network, sending fees skyrocketing.

In response to the sudden network outage, a crack team of Ethereum developers from projects including MetaMask and Infura banded together to deploy quick optimizations and work on long-term scaling solutions for the network.

While crypto enthusiasts remain divided on the quality and value of the CryptoKitties project itself, there's no denying the tectonic level of impact it had on the development of the Ethereum network or that it helped spark the NFT boom.

DeFi summer -- 2020

The summer of 2020 -- colloquially referred to as ""DeFi summer"" by crypto enthusiasts -- marked a turning point in the history of crypto, with Ethereum suddenly becoming a hotbed for an entirely new breed of financial activity.

New users flocked to the Ethereum network in droves, all eager to experiment with the hundreds of new protocols springing up across the network. This sparked a boom in the borrowing, lending and trading of digital assets across hundreds of protocols, many of which now form the backbone of today's multibillion-dollar DeFi sector. Much of the activity was driven by ""yield farmers"" who were rewarded for their activity with tokens. It was either a genius way to crank up the flywheel or unsustainable Ponzinomics.

Big-name Ethereum-based DeFi protocols that took off during DeFi summer, including Aave and Compound, now tout tens of billions of dollars in total value-locked and hundreds of millions in daily trading volume.

There was also an explosion in food-themed DeFi, most notably SushiSwap, which famously forked Uniswap and ""vampire attacked"" it for liquidity and users. After Chef Nomi cashed out $14 million in SUSHI, he handed control of the DEX to a young upstart investor called Sam Bankman-Fried.

Rollup roadmap overhaul -- October 2020

According to Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden, one of the best things about Ethereum is that the roadmap itself isn't super strict or fixed in place.

He tells Magazine the community holds constant ""debates about what to do and what to prioritize next,"" which are crucial to keeping Ethereum decentralized and avoiding capture.

This flexibility was shown in October 2020 when Buterin ditched the long-standing Eth 2.0 roadmap, which planned to scale Ethereum in a monolithic fashion using OG sharding -- something that looked more like 64 Ethereum blockchains all running together in unison.

But Buterin bailed on this form of sharding (later implemented by projects like Near) as an alternative solution began to emerge in the form of optimistic and ZK-rollups, layer 2 projects that take the execution and computation off the main chain but still inherit its security.

As research and development suggested this would become viable as a path forward for scaling, he published a new ""rollup-centric roadmap.""

The new rollup roadmap ensured that the Ethereum network would be forged into an optimal base layer blockchain with the lion's share of scaling and experimentation to occur by way of layer-2 networks, such as Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum, to name a few. Optimistic rollups were seen as the faster solution to implement, with ZK-rollups seen as the likely endgame.

""Today, they take advantage of a lot of technological discoveries that we have now that we did not have 10 years ago. So, like, data availability sampling... did not exist before 2017 -- 2017 was when I published my first work on it. Optimistic and ZK-rollups did not exist, like, really before around 2019,"" Buterin said while speaking at a 2022 press conference at ETH Seoul.

Proof-of-stake, the Merge -- September 2022

Van der Wijden says the Merge is what he considers the ""most pivotal"" moment in the history of the Ethereum network.

The Merge was finalized on Sept. 15, 2022, and marked the switch from an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake mechanism.

""It was an enormous effort from so many people, all working together for a common goal -- I'm glad that we did it. After learning some of the numbers around electricity, CO2 consumption and electronic waste, I'm proud to be a part of that effort.""

The Merge saw Ethereum's energy consumption reduced by 99% and brought about a major shift in the network's tokenomics.

Dencun upgrade: Blobs and sharding -- March 2024

The next crucial step for Ethereum arrived on March 13, 2024, when the Dencun upgrade was implemented on the network.

The Dencun upgrade introduced a suite of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), most notably including EIP-4844.

EIP-4844 introduced proto-danksharding, which utilizes ""blobs,"" a mechanism that allows transaction data to be stored separately and temporarily, to significantly reduce the fees paid for block data on Ethereum layer-2 networks.

Dencun saw a massive reduction in the cost of executing transactions on Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism; however, a side effect was that the total amount of ETH fees burned on the mainnet has fallen significantly in its wake.

Matan Si, a contributor at eOracle, tells Magazine the most significant progress for Ethereum since the Merge has been the expansion of rollups and layer-2 solutions.

""What excites me most about Ethereum's future is the potential to bridge the gap between these execution layers and the real world. Connecting onchain activities with offchain data and computation will unlock a myriad of new use cases.""

BlackRock chooses Ethereum -- March 2024

One of the biggest institutional milestones for Ethereum occurred on March 20, when the asset management giant BlackRock launched its tokenized fund on the Ethereum network.

Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL for short, the money market fund is fully backed by cash and US treasury bills and provides investors with yield paid out daily to tokenholders.

The move was widely regarded as a massive endorsement of the reliability and trustworthiness of the Ethereum network by the world's largest asset manager.

The BUIDL fund now boasts a market capitalization of $517 million and has seen over $116 million in volume in the last month, according to data from rwa.xyz.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that while he was originally a ""naysayer"" on crypto assets, he'd changed his tune and sees crypto, particularly Ether and Bitcoin, as a nascent asset class.

The introduction of spot funds marked the first major step in the adoption of ETH as an institutional-grade asset.

As with the Bitcoin ETFs, the launch has been muted by investors selling up their holdings in Grayscale, which has 10x higher fees than other ETFs for its converted Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).

As of the time of publication, the funds have posted a net outflow of $390 million; however, ETHE flows are slowing, and Nate Geraci, president of the ETF store, says three weeks of inflows into BlackRock's ETHA has already made it the sixth-most successful ETF launched this year.

Next steps: Pectra, the Verge and the Splurge

The next major step on the roadmap is the Pectra upgrade, something van der Wijden says will contain ""a bunch of upgrades"" to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, enabling new use cases, such as trustless staking pools and making the lives of developers easier.

Following Pectra comes Verkle, or the Verge as Vitalik likes to call it.

""With Verkle, we change the way we store the state -- all accounts, balances, contracts -- in order to make it easier to [prove] that your balance was x at block y,"" says van der Wijden.

Van der Wijden describes the Purge as being exactly that: a swathe of new upgrades that relate to getting rid of old functionality that is no longer useful to the network.

""When Ethereum started, they made a bunch of assumptions about how things would work, and a lot of them turned out correct, but a few didn't pan out the way they expected,"" van der Wijden explained.

""So, we'll slowly clean up some of the paths not taken, like disabling Selfdestruct (which was done last upgrade) or, in the future, getting rid of the bloomfilters in the receipts (which will make syncing a node faster),"" he adds.

The Splurge is also somewhat self-explanatory at a top-line level at least, containing new features the Ethereum community is willing to ""splurge"" on.

""They contain some of the already mentioned changes that make Ethereum easier and nicer to use. These changes will probably be shipped together with other upgrades if we feel like there is enough space -- complexity-wise -- in an upcoming hard fork,"" van der Wijden says.",https://s3.magazine.cointelegraph.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/magazine-Ethereum-History-feature-scaled.jpg,0.2705882352941176
Top 13 Best Crypto Presales for August 2024 (x1000 List),https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/top-13-best-crypto-presales-for-august-2024-x1000-list/,2024-08-16,Crypto News Flash,"Cryptocurrency presales like the one of Earthmeta have emerged as a popular method for blockchain startups to raise funds for their projects. Unlike traditional fundraising methods, presales allow investors to purchase tokens that represent a stake in the project before they become publicly available. These tokens can appreciate in value as the project grows, offering substantial returns on investment.

One exciting trend making waves is the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as incentives during the presales. While not a common practice, some of the most successful projects have embraced this strategy, offering free NFTs as part of their presale packages.

Take Axie Infinity, for example. This game, which has gained immense popularity, utilized NFTs during its first phase. Users who participated early in the game and the community were rewarded with unique digital creatures, each represented as an NFT. These digital assets not only served as in-game characters but also as valuable collectibles, adding a layer of excitement and exclusivity to the investment process.

The allure of receiving a rare, potentially valuable NFT as a bonus can significantly boost interest and engagement in a presale. These NFTs can offer various perks, from exclusive access to new features within the project's ecosystem to membership in elite communities or even governance rights. The promise of a unique digital asset creates a buzz, drawing in investors who are eager to be part of something special and potentially lucrative.

So, while not all crypto presales offer NFTs, those that do often turn out to be among the best, including EarthMeta, creating a win-win situation for both the project and its early believers.

The selected presales we're about to discuss are not just opportunities; they are gateways to participating in ground-breaking projects that combine cutting-edge technology with innovative business models.

Given the high stakes, it's essential not to rush into investments without careful consideration. The crypto landscape teems with promises of quick wealth, yet many turn out to be fleeting illusions. To safeguard your investments, it's prudent to focus on projects with robust foundations and well-defined strategies.

Navigating the cryptocurrency landscape demands a blend of cautious optimism and strategic insight. Whether captivated by Earthmeta's potential or drawn to stable digital currencies, understanding the intricacies of risk and reward is crucial. Prepare yourself for a journey where fortunes can change swiftly, as you explore the boundless opportunities and risks that define the realm of digital finance.

EarthMeta is from many sources the best crypto presale of the year, with its metaverse platform that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to craft immersive digital realms.

10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for September 2024,https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-for-september-2024,2024-09-09,Benzinga,"Benzinga's top cryptocurrency picks for August include Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, which are available on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.

The cryptocurrency market has experienced remarkable growth throughout 2024, with a surge in institutional adoption, rising prices and increased confidence from investors. Key events such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and Ethereum ETFs in May have played a significant role in driving the market to unprecedented levels. Additionally, the Bitcoin halving and the rise of meme coins have added to the excitement and frenzy in the market.

Despite the strong performance of the cryptocurrency market year-to-date, many experts and analysts believe that there is still room for further growth in the remainder of the year and into 2025. With this in mind, it's essential for investors to stay informed and be strategic in their investment decisions. Let's look at some of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for August 2024.

The landscape of best cryptocurrencies evolves as the crypto market continually changes. However, here are some of the top tokens for August 2024.

Bitcoin has been the leader in the cryptocurrency sector, setting the stage for all other projects. Acting as a form of payment and a store of value, it has performed strongly in 2024, reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) and surpassing previous records set in 2021. Sentiment on Bitcoin remains predominantly bullish, with many anticipating the price rally will continue. In 2024, primary catalysts included approving spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the bitcoin halving in late April. ETFs have attracted new investors, while the halving is expected to decrease the daily token supply.

Ethereum is the most prominent blockchain, providing users access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It accommodates various projects, from AI startups to leading meme coins. Its robust development platform and easily usable innovative contract system make this possible. It is a versatile chain, allowing users to access all aspects of Web3 easily. The chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) system in 2022. In 2024, some significant events have been upgrades to the chain that increased speeds and lowered costs, as well as the approval of spot ETH ETFs, which could launch later this year.

Solana had a rough start in 2023 because Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX were some of the largest investors in the project. This resulted in the token losing over 96% of its value within 11 months of the FTX collapse. At the time, many thought that SOL was a dead project. However, 2023 and 2024 have seen a revival of the project. Many new tokens have started on Solana recently. These projects include staking protocols, storage, AI and many others. However, memecoins have been one of the driving forces behind Solana's comeback. These new tokens have skyrocketed in popularity, causing investors to buy and swap SOL for these new tokens.

Ripple is a centralized company hoping to bring crypto's possibilities to the banking sector. Its business model uses its native token, XRP, to facilitate transactions. Ripple can use the XRP token as an intermediary between other assets. For example, BTC and ETH are not directly interchangeable. However, Ripple can convert BTC to XRP and then convert the XRP into ETH. This concept can be applied to any currency swap or transaction a bank may have to make daily. XRP is particularly useful in this case because it is fast and has transaction fees that are a tiny fraction of a cent. If financial institutions start using XRP on a larger scale, the price could increase. Additionally, discussions of a spot XRP ETF have surfaced. If this were to happen, it could increase the token's price.

Dogecoin has been able to stick around in the top 20 tokens by market cap for some time and has gone up with the rest of the market in 2024. Additionally, new use cases in the future could send the token even higher. Elon Musk said he would consider allowing users to buy a Tesla car with DOGE, enabling people to buy Tesla merch with DOGE. If this were to happen, it could increase demand for the token and send the price higher. DOGE has also held its spot as the top meme coin in past bull and bear markets, performing particularly well in 2024.

Avalanche is a chain focused on high speeds and low costs. It hopes to make interacting with DeFi as straightforward and inexpensive as possible. The project saw relatively low volatility in 2023 but has performed exceptionally well in 2024. Its success has resulted from new projects making a home on the chain. Most of these projects revolve around crypto exchanges and trading. For example, one of the most popular protocols is Trader Joe, which allows users to trade, stake, yield farm and provide liquidity for a handful of Avalanche-based projects. If Avalanche can attract a more diverse range of projects, it could continue its upward momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into 2025.

One of the defining characteristics of computing is exponential growth. Computers are becoming increasingly faster and take up less space, and advances in quantum computing could pose a risk to some of the larger blockchains. For instance, a quantum computer could overthrow the current mining system on bitcoin through a 51% attack, or the computer could bypass the current cryptographic protocols and access anyone's wallet address. While these may seem like distant threats, researchers already use quantum computing in various contexts. Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is looking to solve this issue by creating a new security protocol called the eXtended Merkle Tree Signature Scheme (XMSS). The blockchain is designed to resist quantum computing attacks, potentially allowing it to survive if other blockchains go down from quantum attacks.

SHIB is among the few meme coins that will survive the 2022 bear market. The project is a meme coin based on the Shiba Inu dog breed, akin to the DOGE meme. The project has spent several years building an ecosystem that gives the token utility beyond just a meme coin. For example, it has created NFT projects, a layer 2 blockchain called Shibarium, a separate token for staking rewards and a biweekly magazine. These new uses have helped the token survive the bear market and perform well in the current market. The token has sustained a strong community over the years, allowing it to cement itself as a meme coin worth the hype.

NEAR hopes to solve one of the most significant issues many see with Ethereum and other chains. These chains require vast computing power to operate and to provide services to their users. This requirement puts lots of strain on the chain, resulting in slow speeds and high costs. NEAR utilizes sharding and a novel consensus mechanism called Nightshade to improve speeds and scalability. Developers can benefit from others' projects, as everything on the platform is open source. These are optimal conditions for developers, as it is much easier to make faster applications. If NEAR can attract more projects that lead to more use cases, the price has room to keep increasing.

Binance Coin was hit in late 2023 when its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), was allegedly involved in money laundering charges. Many wondered if Binance could continue as a company, as the charges were severe. However, the dust has settled from the incident, and BNB has been on a solid upward trajectory in 2024. This is mainly driven by Binance's exchange listing new tokens, which makes the platform attractive to investors looking to stay ahead of the latest crypto trends and purchase the hottest tokens as soon as they are available. If Binance can continue to move forward from the scandal with CZ and bring in new users with interesting new tokens, there is room for the price to continue increasing.

Cryptocurrency is a token-based way of transacting online. Tokens are stored on an unchangeable ledger that anyone can view. The data is also stored on an extensive computer network, allowing for much easier scalability.

Most cryptocurrencies are processed by other users on the blockchain. These users can verify transactions in exchange for rewards, usually through staking (PoS) or mining (PoW).

Since the basic framework for technology has been developed by previous projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is easy for new developers to create a blockchain of their own. Projects like Ethereum allow users to create their tokens with little effort. Because of this, tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies are available to invest in.

To invest in crypto, you first have to create an account on a cryptocurrency trading platform. Some of the top firms are Coinbase, Kraken, Webull, and eToro. These sites are well known for their low fees, security, and ease of use.

To make an account, you can simply navigate to one of the trading platforms and enter an email and password to create your account. You will then have to provide documentation (e.g. passport, driver's license, etc.) to verify your account. Once your account is verified, you can link a bank account using various methods and fund the trading account.

Some platforms, such as Coinbase, only offer crypto trading. This can be beneficial for those looking to invest in crypto alone and niche tokens. However, other sites, such as Robinhood, allow stock and crypto trading on the same account, though they have fewer crypto offerings. This is just one of the many differences between platforms, so it is important to understand the pros and cons of each before investing.

The IRS treats cryptocurrency as a form of property. Because of this, you must pay capital gains tax on crypto sales. Crypto exchanges send Form 1099s, which report capital gains and losses for the year. You can use this form to report your taxes on crypto transactions.

The forms are in your account information and are easily accessible. Additionally, they are not too complicated and are easy to report when you file your taxes.

In January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a handful of spot ETFs to begin trading. These investment instruments allow equity investors to access a variety of underlying assets. They work by the sponsoring firm acquiring a pool of assets (in this case, Bitcoin) and then packaging them into shares, which are then distributed to investors. For the Bitcoin ETFs, the sponsors bought lots of Bitcoins and then packaged them into shares, which traders can buy and sell.

As of right now, only Bitcoin ETFs are trading. However, the SEC recently approved spot Ethereum ETFs, which require more due diligence from the SEC before they can officially begin trading. However, some speculate that the ETH ETFs could start trading within a few months.

There are countless cryptocurrencies to invest in, and new tokens are created daily. While this can make it difficult to hone in on a specific token to buy, it can also mean many opportunities in the markets. However, it is essential to understand your own risk tolerance and investment objectives before investing. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, leading to large profits and significant losses.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/29162915/best-cryptocurrencies-768x512.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.4588235294117646
Ethereum price today: ETH is up 1.52% today,https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-today-09-11-2024/,2024-09-11,USA Today,"Editorial Note: Blueprint may earn a commission from affiliate partner links featured here on our site.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,350.86, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum price history

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $279.87 billion. It's up 46% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $279.87 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $77.08 billion, XRP at $53.39 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.67 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $279.87 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $308 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $292 billion.

What is ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,350.86.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 118% and ETH is up 46% year over year.

How to buy ethereum online

You can buy ethereum on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Ethereum trades under the symbol ETH. There are also online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Robinhood, Interactive Brokers and Webull.

In addition, you can buy ethereum through leading payment apps Venmo and PayPal. Finally, ethereum can be bought directly by searching for a physical cryptocurrency ATM that sells ether.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

With our first project, we would like to highlight the Nakamoto Games. The idea of earning money while playing games has gained immense popularity among gamers in recent times. This trend has given rise to play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity, which is a perfect example of how players can earn real money while having fun.

Among the various play-to-earn platforms, Nakamoto Games stands out as a blockchain-based gaming platform that has caught the attention of many players. The platform offers a wide range of games that provide players with the opportunity to earn a steady stream of income to participate in the games offered by the Nakamoto Games platform.

Players need to connect their Web3 wallet that holds Naka tokens before choosing a game to play. The Naka token serves as the utility token of the platform and is required to power the games and purchase special weapons or features for certain games. Additionally, to maintain the token's economic stability and deflationary structure, Naka has decided to partially burn the Naka tokens as more tokens are added to the reward pool.

This is an innovative way to ensure that the value of the tokens remains intact while providing players with a steady stream of income. Apart from providing players with a variety of games, Naka has also set up a governance system that allows participants to vote on different proposals, such as burning Naka tokens.

This system ensures that players have a say in the platform's decision-making process, making it a more democratic and community-driven platform. Moreover, Nakamoto Games has created its own metaverse called Naka Verse. This metaverse offers players a more immersive gaming experience with play-to-earn games from the platform and more.

The metaverse also includes shops restaurants, NFT museums, and digital land plots for sale. Owners of these land plots will have the advantage of creating valuable resources faster than other players, making it a valuable investment for players looking to earn a steady income through play-to-earn games.

In conclusion, Naka is a groundbreaking project that truly stands out in the world of play-to-earn gaming. It boasts an impressive array of games catering to a wide range of tastes and preferences. The project is not just about fun and games, it also introduces a deflationary token structure that promotes a sustainable economic model.

But what truly sets Naka apart is its innovative metaverse. This metaverse is a virtual world where players can interact, explore, and create their own experiences. It's a place where the boundaries between gaming and reality blur, providing endless possibilities for players. Therefore, for those with an interest in the play to earn gaming space Naka is undeniably a project that deserves attention.

Nakamoto Games currently has a market cap of 50 million. A market cap of 10 billion can be reached in a bull run. That is a beautiful 200 x from here.

USDT vs USDC -- What's the Difference?

Our second tiny altcoin of this post is called Parcl. Let's jump right in with our first project on Solana we would like to highlight called parcel. Parcl is a RWA project on the Solana blockchain that democratizes real estate investment by introducing fractional ownership of properties through blockchain technology.

It recently launched its native Parcl token, which has several essential functions including governance, staking, and transaction fees. The Parcl token allows users to participate in decision-making, earn rewards, and pay for transactions within the ecosystem by tokenizing real estate.

Parcl offers investors the ability to gain exposure to global real estate markets without the need to own physical properties, offering a cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional real estate investing Parcl use of the Solana blockchain ensures a decentralized, transparent, and efficient system taking advantage of Solana's low transaction fees and high-speed network. This makes Parcl distinct from traditional real estate platforms and other blockchain-based projects.

The ability to tokenize real estate means users can buy, sell, or trade fractions of properties, allowing for diversification across multiple markets with minimal capital. The introduction of the Parcl token enhances the parcel platform's utility by integrating it into various aspects of the ecosystem.

For instance, by holding and staking parcel tokens, users are rewarded with part of the transaction fees generated on the platform. This staking mechanism not only incentivizes long-term participation but also helps secure the network. The governance feature of Parcl tokens empowers the community to influence key decisions, ensuring that the platform evolves according to the needs and preferences of its users.

Looking forward, Parcl plans to expand its offerings, potentially adding more real estate assets from different regions to provide a broader range of investment opportunities. The platform also aims to continually refine its user experience, ensuring that both novice and experienced investors can easily navigate and utilize its features.

Through strategic partnerships and technological advancements, Parcl is set to reshape the landscape of real estate investment, making it more aligned with the digital economy and the preferences of modern investors.

Parcl has a market cap of 20 million. We think that a market cap of 2 billion is possible in 2025. That is a nice 100 x from here.

Our first tiny AI project in this post is up next called DEAI by Zero1 Labs. Zero1 Labs is a decentralized artificial intelligence ecosystem with a focus on data governance. They have developed a comprehensive DEAI product suite featuring a secure, modular, and interconnected platform for DEAI tools and apps.

Together with their Zero1 Labs construct program and proprietary cipher chain, this suite forms a resilient flywheel, fueling the forthcoming DEAI Revolution with momentum. Their mission is to simplify the development process and enhance the discoverability, growth, and monetization of DEAI products while ensuring user data remains in the hands of its rightful owners, the users.

At DEAI, they believe that AI, combined with blockchain technology, is poised to become the largest vertical in the markets. Blockchain-based tokens will serve as the native digital currency, enabling AI systems to transact. DEAI aims to promote the development and expansion of decentralized AI DApps.

This objective is divided into three primary areas.

Zero1 Labs emphasizes three fundamental concepts for decentralized AI, namely data governance, decentralized node infrastructure, and AI tooling. Decentralization enhances data sharing across diverse data sets and fosters shared AI models for improved accuracy and performance.

It also encourages decentralized model training for efficiency and privacy, creating new revenue streams for data providers. The creation of a distributed network of nodes improves security and scalability, while the focus lies in developing decentralized, globally accessible tools free of charge.

The primary goal is to create an open-access, decentralized toolkit for AI This strategy democratizes AI development by offering free access to advanced tools and resources under the Zero Economic framework. Users are able to stake DEAI while offering staking rewards and the opportunity to participate in lock drops to obtain ecosystem incentives.

Adopting a strategy similar to that of Celestia, holders of the DEAI token will be given precedence for early participation in three forthcoming Zero Construct program project launches that are currently under wraps.

In conclusion, DEAI is emerging as a significant player in the AI space that keeps building and expanding, mounting a challenge to Bit Tensor's dominance. DEAI currently has a market cap of 20 million. This project has a promising future, and it can reach a market cap of at least 6 billion during a bull run. That is an astonishing 300X from here.

As our fourth project, we would like to present Trias. Trias is a decentralized infrastructure designed to deliver trustworthy and reliable cloud computing. The goal of Trias is to foster a world where machines can be trusted, countering potential risks like data leaks and privacy violations often associated with untrusted machines.

Trias, an acronym for Trustworthy and Reliable Intelligent Autonomous Systems, is an innovative Web3 project centered around the concept of trust in machines. It aims to create a reliable, general-purpose computation infrastructure where systems only implement expected behaviors.

Trias also offers compatibility with all platforms, including mobile IoT devices and servers, and features a self-sustaining token economy operating as a decentralized software as a service.

Trias ensures high scalability, continuous availability, and improved security, thereby enhancing the traditional SaaS model Trias force, a software suite developed by the Trias team, embodies this DS model, providing blockchain-based services to various sectors through its key offerings. Trias force auditing.

Trias force security and Trias force ERP. The Leviatom layer, part of the Trias architecture uses a web of trusted execution environments to ensure the accurate execution of software applications. The Prometh Layer is a traceable development framework that documents all crucial data related to the lifespan of software on a blockchain.

The Mag Cadre layer is a consensus-driven programming model that allows the creation of unique consensus strategies for advanced enterprise DApps. Trias has initiated several innovative projects such as Triathlon Lab, Ethanim network, and Tusima, which operate as nodes.

Triathlon aims to empower project builders and token holders to drive the testing and auditing process of crypto projects throughout their life cycles. Tusima is a layer 2 controllable privacy financial network based on ZK rollup, offering superior on-chain data privacy protection.

Lastly, Aeternum aims to build a new blockchain platform that supports the full decentralization of large-scale applications, redefining the concepts of people, space, and applications in the Web3 era. Trias currently has a market cap of 50 million. We believe that Trias has the potential to reach a market cap of at least 5 billion in the future. That is exactly 100 X from here.

Project number five is our first RWA project of today called Swarm Markets. Swarm Markets presents itself as the world's first licensed DeFi platform, regulated by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.

This project functions as a compliant, AMM-based Dex for Ethereum, targeting both institutions and individual investors seeking a safer way to participate in DeFi. The swarm market supports various types of tokens, including crypto assets and tokenized real-world assets. It was an early entrant into the rapidly growing tokenized RWA segment in 2021.

The project announced it was adding up to 250 liquidity providers, who pledged $15 million. It also launched the first version of its Dex on Ethereum. As of 2024, swarm markets authorize many different types of tokens for listing, including tokenized versions of stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia.

Automated market makers are a common feature of decentralized exchanges in the DeFi sector. Most of them, like Uniswap, Balancer, or Curve, use AMM solely for cryptocurrencies and tokens. Swarm markets, however, target investors who wish to trade on-chain tokens representing a range of assets, including stocks, bonds commodities, and more.

The underlying AMM operates similarly to a balancer, with liquidity providers contributing Erc20 tokens representing crypto assets or securities to liquidity pools, where they are available for traders wanting to swap these assets. Participation in swarm markets requires a passport and a KYC process linked to a self-custodial crypto wallet such as MetaMask or ledger.

Swarm also offers business accounts for institutional participation and operates a permissionless, decentralized, over-the-counter trading service for institutions wanting to execute large on-chain transactions After a clarification from the European Supervisory Market Authority that the new markets and Crypto Assets Regulation would not apply to decentralized applications and services, the project implemented OTC orders due to legal restrictions.

Swarm markets is not available in all countries. It doesn't service U.S. residents, but residents in many European, Asian, and Latin American countries are allowed. SMRT currently has a market cap of 30 million. We believe that SMRT has the potential to reach a market cap of at least 4 billion in the future. That is a 133X from here.

We are also heavily investing in another tiny RWA project called Credifi. The Credifi platform is an innovative blend of DeFi protocol and traditional fintech solutions. Within the conventional financial ecosystem. Small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, and DeFi lenders often face challenges in accessing lending and borrowing services.

Notable problems include inconsistent DeFi yields, high interest rates, and a limited number of lenders who can meet the demands of SMEs. Credifi addresses these issues through decentralized and secure lending. Its services are provided in three stages portfolio lending, project-based P2P lending, and trade finance.

In the portfolio lending stage, Credit Fi allows users to lend stablecoins to various portfolios. These portfolios range from low to high risk and lenders can select them based on their risk tolerance. Credifi assists lenders with risk assessment, credit score data, and other relevant information. All Credifi portfolios, depending on the risk, will yield an APY of approximately 10%.

In the project-based P2P lending stage, Credifi leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to offer peer-to-peer lending services. This stage aims to enable users to connect directly for lending and borrowing without intermediaries.

Credifi also offers zero collateral loans at this stage. In the final stage, trade finance credit combines traditional financial services with decentralization to offer lending and borrowing services to a wide customer base without barriers. This stage includes trade finance, meaning lenders and borrowers can enter into a deal and underwrite agreements such as a letter of credit or letter of guarantee.

The Credifi platform serves as a bridge between crypto lenders and SMEs. With its versatile functions, tokenizing real-world assets not only enables fractional ownership but also enhances liquidity. SMEs can use these asset tokens as collateral for loans on the credit fi platform, thereby improving liquidity and enabling diversified portfolios.

Leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology, the Credifi platform ensures seamless transactions. Credifi currently has a market cap of 10 million. We predict that Credifi will have a market cap of at least $2 billion in 2025. That is a beautiful 200X from here.

As our seventh project, we would like to highlight Dione Protocol. Dione is leading a pioneering initiative to transform the energy industry with an incentivized energy trading ecosystem on an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain powered by Deepin.

This innovation aims to lower the energy sector's carbon footprint and encourage retail consumers to become prosumers, generating and selling their own electricity. The Dione Protocol aims to democratize the energy sector, enabling retail consumers to actively participate by installing renewable energy generation equipment like solar panels and windmills.

Retail users can join the green energy economy and start their own energy business. This shift from a consumer-focused model to a prosumer driven approach could significantly change the industry.

Why the Valuation Gap Between Ethereum and Bitcoin is Increasing,http://topnews.in/why-valuation-gap-between-ethereum-and-bitcoin-increasing-2414907,2024-08-29,topnews.in,"Cryptocurrency investors have most likely heard the argument that Ethereum could one day surpass Bitcoin in terms of market valuation the gap between valuation of these two major cryptocurrencies would reduce with time. However, the opposite has been going on for the last few months. The interest in Ethereum has declined and Bitcoin is maintaining its supremacy. Let us check what has been going on with Ethereum during the last few months.

Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced a significant market downturn, evidenced by a $44.5 million outflow from Ethereum ETFs, primarily driven by Grayscale's ETHE. The decline is further reflected in Ethereum's trading volume, transaction count, and price, with the cryptocurrency failing to breach key resistance levels. Institutional interest appears to be waning, even as Bitcoin ETFs enjoy inflows. Despite these challenges, some analysts highlight that the recent decline is not as severe as in previous years. Ethereum's price remains vulnerable, trading within a critical range that could determine its near-term trajectory.

Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. recorded substantial net outflows of $44.5 million last week, marking a concerning trend for the cryptocurrency. This decline was largely spearheaded by Grayscale's ETHE, which saw $118 million in outflows, overshadowing the minor inflows recorded by other newly launched Ethereum ETFs. This exodus highlights a growing risk aversion among investors, further pressuring ETH's market performance.

Ethereum's trading volume and transaction count have plummeted, reflecting a broader decline in investor confidence. The 7-day moving average of daily trading volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped sharply, from $6.56 billion on July 26 to just $2.9 billion by the end of August. Additionally, the monthly transaction count fell to 27.27 million, a level not seen since May 2020, underscoring the significant retreat in market activity.

Ethereum has struggled to break above a crucial resistance level, contributing to its ongoing price consolidation. On Saturday, ETH tested the resistance at $2,817 but failed to sustain its gains, leading to a subsequent retracement. The price action formed a long-legged Doji candle, signaling indecision among traders and confirming a bearish reversal. This has kept ETH confined within a key rectangle pattern, with potential implications for future price movements.

The lack of institutional interest in Ethereum is becoming increasingly evident, particularly when compared to Bitcoin. Despite the broader market anticipating a potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve, Ethereum has not seen the same level of institutional inflows as Bitcoin. The contrast is stark, with Bitcoin ETFs posting seven consecutive days of net inflows, even as Grayscale's GBTC experienced outflows. This trend may indicate a shifting sentiment among institutional investors, who seem to be favoring Bitcoin over Ethereum in the current market environment.

While Ethereum's recent performance has been lackluster, it's worth noting that the decline in activity this August has been less severe compared to previous years. According to Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han, the decrease in ether trading volumes this August was a modest 7.7%, which is significantly lower than the average 16.8% decline observed over the last five years. This suggests that while Ethereum is facing headwinds, the current downturn may not be as dire as historical patterns might suggest.

Ethereum is currently trading around $2,570, down nearly 3% on the day, with significant liquidations recorded over the past 24 hours. For ETH to stage a recovery, it must break above the upper resistance of the current rectangle pattern, potentially reclaiming a critical support level that has held for nearly six months. A successful breakout could see Ethereum rally towards the next resistance level at $3,542, and potentially challenge its yearly high at $4,093. However, significant resistance at the 200-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages may pose challenges to this upward trajectory.

Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has seen remarkable adoption, attracting hundreds of millions of users and gaining the attention of mainstream investment firms. As a decentralized platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries, Ethereum stands as a technological powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space. Recent developments, including advancements in Layer 2 (L2) solutions and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology, have further strengthened Ethereum's fundamentals. Despite market volatility, Ethereum's robust technological infrastructure and growing ecosystem continue to position it as a leading force in the blockchain industry.

Since its release in 2015, Ethereum has experienced exponential adoption, attracting hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Its decentralized nature has captured the attention of mainstream investment firms and payment applications, establishing Ethereum as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. The platform's ability to host smart contracts and dApps without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference has set it apart in the digital asset landscape.

Ethereum goes beyond being just another cryptocurrency by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform for smart contracts and dApps. Central to Ethereum's operations is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node. The EVM executes bytecode and smart contracts -- self-executing agreements coded directly into the blockchain -- ensuring transactions are trustless and automated. This innovation eliminates the need for intermediaries in contractual agreements, representing a paradigm shift in how transactions are conducted across various industries.

Ethereum's platform supports a wide array of cryptocurrencies, underscoring its significant market influence. As of March 2024, 10 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies are either based on or linked to Ethereum, highlighting the platform's foundational role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its versatile framework enables the development of diverse applications, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, and has seen widespread integration by major organizations exploring blockchain technology.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has emphasized the network's ""crazy strong"" fundamentals, countering claims of weakness during the current market cycle. Key to this strength is the significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum's Layer 2 (L2) solutions, which now average below $0.01. Buterin attributed this cost efficiency to the implementation of EIP-4844 and the introduction of dedicated block spaces, known as ""blobs,"" for data transmitted from L2 blockchains. Additionally, Ethereum L2 solutions like Arbitrum have seen their fees drop dramatically, with daily transaction counts consistently surpassing 1 million, further demonstrating the network's sustained activity and user engagement.

Buterin also highlighted the progress of Optimism and Arbitrum, both of which have reached critical milestones in their development, referred to as ""Stage 1."" These platforms are essential to Ethereum's long-term scalability strategy, offering faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the main Ethereum network. The advancements in these L2 solutions are crucial as they enhance Ethereum's ability to handle a growing number of transactions, ensuring the network remains competitive and accessible.

Ethereum has made significant strides in improving the user experience, particularly in the realm of cross-L2 wallets, which now require less manual intervention when switching networks. This simplification enhances the overall usability of the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more attractive to both new and existing users. Furthermore, the maturation of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology has expanded its accessibility for decentralized application (dApp) developers, enabling more sophisticated privacy and security features within the Ethereum platform.

Buterin pointed to the ongoing innovation within Ethereum's ecosystem, particularly in privacy and security. The evolution of ZK tooling and the emergence of second-generation privacy solutions, such as 0xbow.io, underscore Ethereum's commitment to advancing privacy technology. Additionally, the development of Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (STARKs) is vital to Ethereum's long-term security and decentralization goals. These advancements, coupled with the expanding ecosystem for identity, reputation, and credentials, are expected to drive further adoption and strengthen Ethereum's position in the market.

Looking ahead, Ethereum's long-term investment potential appears optimistic, fueled by its continuous technological advancements, expanding adoption, and the broadening scope of its applications. As the platform continues to innovate and evolve, it is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the rapidly growing blockchain industry, making it a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to the future of decentralized technology.",,0.09019607843137245
How to Buy Quant (QNT) Guide * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-quant-qnt,2024-09-12,Benzinga,"Large corporations, banks and governments are utilizing distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to enhance their cloud-based services. Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum are among the most popular options, but the market is still fractured between more than 10 major DLT providers.

Before the introduction of Quant Network's Overledger, there were challenges in enabling applications to interact with multiple DLTs. The Quant token's value surged to eight times its initial worth in early 2021 but fell during the 2022 cryptocurrency market crash. Despite not reaching previous highs, it remained a trading price between $60 and $100 in 2024.

With so many cryptocurrencies on the market, it can be hard to know what's legit and what's a cash grab. Learn more about what Quant is and how you can start investing today.

Ready to get started investing in Quant? Here's a step by step guide on how to buy Quant today!

Quant is supported by several cryptocurrency trading platforms, including Coinbase and Uphold. Visit the website or download the mobile app of your chosen exchange. Navigate to the Sign Up or Register option. You'll need to provide an email address and password for account creation. In the United States, regulations force cryptocurrency exchanges to verify user identities before they can trade. This usually entails providing your address, Social Security number and a picture of your driver's license (or other valid ID). Once you set up your exchange account and enter in the required verification information, you will be ready to start trading crypto.

Now that your account is ready for trading, you'll need to deposit fiat currency or another supported cryptocurrency to fund your account. Many platforms accept various payment methods. These include credit and debit cards, wire transfers, and cryptocurrency deposits from external exchanges and crypto wallets.

Choose your preferred payment method and follow the platform's instructions. Enter the amount you wish to deposit and review any applicable transaction fees before confirming the transaction.

Now that your account is funded, you are ready to place a buy order. Navigate to the trade section of your chosen platform and search for Quant or QNT. Click the option to buy and enter your desired amount. Review the details before executing the order. Once confirmed, your QNT will be credited to your portfolio and you will receive a confirmation email.

If you deposit a different crypto, you will have to sell it for U.S. dollars (USD) before you can purchase Quant. Once you have your USD ready in your exchange account, look for the QNT/USD pair and make your purchase.

Quant is the payment and validator token of the Overledger operating system, Quant Network's flagship product. It is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that is used to pay for Quant's services and validate, sign and encrypt transactions sent on Overledger. Quant Network's ultimate goal is to provide seamless interoperability to the fractured world of distributed ledger technologies.

DLTs are databases spread among multiple physical locations and network participants. They remove the need for a central intermediary to process and validate transactions on it. It's important to understand that DLTs and blockchains are not the same. In fact, blockchains are just a subset of distributed ledgers. Blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are decentralized ledgers in which each new transaction is verified via cryptographic signatures (known as hash functions) that build off of previous transactions.

Quant Network's Overledger aims to be both regulator and developer-friendly. The company already works with multiple government agencies to improve their cloud frameworks including the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) of the United Kingdom. Developers can build simple applications on Overledger that can interact with multiple DLTs and other applications on the same DLT. They must pay for Quant Network's platform and annual license fees with the Quant token, possibly driving its price up whenever more applications are built on Overledger.

Quant Network Ltd was founded by Gilbert Verdian in 2015, years before its flagship product Overledger and the Quant token were launched. Verdian saw an enormous problem that needed solving when he was working at Her Majesty's Treasury and later in the Department of Health in Australia. He saw how impactful DLTs would be in the future and sought to fix the largest issues in modern global information exchange. He also understood that no one DLT would take over the market, and thus improvements in interoperability would be vital. So far he has been right, and Quant Network has performed incredibly well this year.

The 1.5 update to the Overledger OS in January 2021 opened Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple ledgers to its applications. Quant's price almost immediately exploded to over $40 from about $11 earlier that month. The price continued to rise after further updates this June giving apps even more functionality. It skyrocketed to above $400 at its all-time high in September. At the time of writing, the token is hovering around $75. It has a market capitalization of around $915, ranking QNT as the 69th largest crypto in terms of market cap. The company plans on releasing further updates to add access to more DLTs and to further expand app functionality and ease of use.

Check out some of the best crypto exchanges that support Quant token below. Coinbase is a great option for new investors, and they have a Coinbase Learn program that will deposit free crypto to your account for learning about the technology.

There are two options for storing QNT: hardware wallets, which are physical devices that keep cryptocurrency private keys offline, and software wallets, which are digital applications that store private keys online or on devices like smartphones or computers.

Ledger is a leading cryptocurrency wallet brand. The Nano S is Ledger's basic model with all the security and simplicity a hardware wallet needs. The Nano X model adds Bluetooth functionality and a larger screen for about twice the price of the basic model. Both Ledgers support most major cryptos including Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and all ERC-20 tokens (including Quant).

Coinbase Wallet is a secure software wallet available as a browser extension and mobile app. It features crypto trading, storage for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and access to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, while supporting major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and LTC.

Altcoins like Quant can be extremely volatile and you should know how to sell or convert your tokens. It's incredibly easy to close your Quant position. You can either sell your Quant on the exchange you purchased it from or you can use a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap it for another token. If you want to sell it for USD just send it back to your exchange account, find the QNT/USD pair and sell. You could also go to Uniswap, a (DEX) on Ethereum, and use a software wallet to swap it for another cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Daily price fluctuations are typical, especially with smaller cryptocurrencies. Real-time data is essential for investors in a dynamic market. Here's a quick look at how some of the top coins are performing today.

Quant has been a fantastic investment for anyone that bought and held before Overledger 1.5 was released. However, those who purchased the token at its peak may be down more than 80% on their investment. This is the reality for altcoins in general, not just Quant. They are volatile and risky investments that may see massive returns or destructive losses.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/08110237/quant.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.04313725490196085

Ethereum - Second Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization

Next is Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and the most well-known altcoin. At basic, Ethereum is a decentralized platform where developers can create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized apps (DApps). Its native coin, Ether, is used to pay for network transaction fees and computational services. Above all, Ethereum is well-known for its smart contract capability and the continuing shift to the proof-of-stake paradigm.

And, as we speak, Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency world, especially due to the ongoing upgrades to Ethereum 2.0 that aims to address scalability and energy efficiency, potentially driving further adoption and price increase. As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum's influence on the market is undeniable. Therefore, it is more than likely that Ethereum is a but as Bitcoin price recovers.

As seen in the chart above, Ethereum is currently trading for $2759.3 per ETH/USD, with a return of 6.37% in the last week, nearly %23 YTD, and over 70%YoY. Overall, Ethereum is a strong buy at any time when the crypto market is in a bullish momentum.

Bitcoin's price has shown a remarkable recovery in late 2023 and 2024, driven by several key factors, including macroeconomic trends, institutional adoption, and developments within the crypto industry. As of writing, it has a YTD of nearly 52% and an annual return of around 145%.

But it was not all smooth sailing for Bitcoin this year. After climbing from $35K at the beginning of the year to above $73K, BTC fell to $48K in the early days of August.

Now, as of late August 2024, Bitcoin has rebounded from its lows earlier in the year, with a strong upward momentum that has reignited investor confidence. Bitcoin is currently trading at $64196 per BTC/USD, an increase of 33% from the lowest level just 20 days ago.

All in all, BTC's bullish momentum appears to be strong at the moment, fueled by the upcoming elections in the United States, the launch of new ETFs, and the massive liquidations in short positions. If the trend continues, Bitcoin is set to test key levels of $67K, $71K, and its yearly high of $73K.

Will Bitcoin's Rally Continue in Q4?

As we move into the final quarter of 2024, several factors could influence whether Bitcoin's rally will continue. Market sentiment remains bullish, supported by ongoing institutional interest, the upcoming US elections, and potential regulatory clarity.

However, challenges such as inflation concerns and global economic conditions could also impact the pace of Bitcoin's growth. As it seems, Bitcoin's volatility continues to be the main obstacle to be a global currency.

So overall, Bitcoin's performance in Q4 2024 is a subject of significant debate among analysts, but several factors suggest that the cryptocurrency may experience a strong rally during this period.

Historical Patterns and Halving Impact

Historically, Bitcoin has always seen a price increase following halving events, which cut the reward for mining new blocks and hence reduce the number of new Bitcoins entering the market, causing scarcity. The most recent halving that occurred on April 19, 2024, has set the stage for this potential rally, as previous halvings have been followed by substantial price increases within 12 to 18 months. Consequently, many analysts believe that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs in the coming quarters, possibly even hitting $100,000 or higher by late 2025.

Institutional Investment and ETFs

Another key driver is the growing institutional investment in Bitcoin, particularly through ETFs. The rapid growth of Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, has added significant buying pressure, which could continue to propel prices upwards.

Some experts have predicted that Bitcoin ETFs could surpass gold ETFs in assets under management within a few years, further boosting Bitcoin's price.

Market Sentiment and Technical Analysis

Despite some short-term volatility and consolidation phases, the overall market sentiment remains bullish. Analysts are closely watching key resistance levels, particularly the $64,000-$65,000 range, which, if broken, could lead to a new rally. Some forecasts even suggest that Bitcoin could reach $95,000 to $143,000 in Q4, making it one of the most significant bull runs in recent history.

However, it is vital to understand that Bitcoin price changes are extremely volatile and impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors. While the outlook for Q4 2024 is optimistic, there is always a level of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, and investors should remain cautious and stay informed about ongoing market developments.

Final Word

In sum, the recovery of Bitcoin's price is setting the stage for broader market opportunities. As we approach the end of 2024, these 10 cryptocurrencies mentioned above represent some of the best options for those looking to capitalize on the current market conditions.

Each of these tokens offers different unique value propositions and the potential for significant returns, making these coins the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now as Bitcoin recovers. They are also worthy of consideration for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Along with reputable coins such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Toncoin, investors should consider high-potential projects such as Crypto All Stars, PlayDoge, Pepe Unchained, and Base Dawgz.

Developing a Cryptocurrency: Design and Implementation,https://coinpedia.org/blockchain-developers/developing-a-cryptocurrency-design-and-implementation/,2024-09-12,Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide,"Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.

Cryptocurrencies have come a long way from just being a wild idea shared by some tech enthusiasts. They are making waves across the globe and compelling us to change the way we think about money, ownership, and trust. This evolution began with Bitcoin and now has grown much larger adding more currencies like Ethereum, Tether, BNB, and many more.

Cryptocurrencies represent a transformative shift in how we perceive and manage money. This transition is not just about trading or investing in the new currencies but beyond that. This has changed the way financial systems work fundamentally. Businesses are gaining interest in this field due to which creating new cryptocurrencies has become a keen area of research for entrepreneurs, innovators, and developers.

Creating cryptocurrency isn't just about writing a code and hoping that it works. It is more about crafting a solution that is more secure, effective, and engaging, something that people will see and want to use. A cultivated cryptocurrency doesn't just justify its code but also sustains the market and grabs a spot in users' minds forever. To achieve this kind of success for your currency you need to understand the bigger picture rather than just being proficient in technical skills.

Imagine being able to create your own digital currency, that could potentially change the way people think about money and finance. Isn't it fascinating? This gives you a chance to innovate and create a digital currency that has a real impact on the entire community and be part of something truly transformative.

This article will guide you through the essential steps of designing a cryptocurrency, starting from the conceptual phase, where you define the purpose, audience, and unique value proposition of your currency.

Let's dive into the world of cryptocurrency creation, where technology meets innovation and you get the chance to shape the future of finance. Ready to begin? Let's get started!

To create a successful cryptocurrency one must consider all the aspects from the underlying design, technology, market needs, and implementation strategies.

This step is the beginning of the idealization of the currency, and it has research-based parameters to make the currency successful. But before diving into coding, it's crucial to clarify the purpose of the cryptocurrency you develop.

Objective: Think about a problem that interests you!

What unique value could your cryptocurrency provide to solve it? Start by identifying the market gap or a specific problem that your cryptocurrency will address. Write down your idea and consider how it could be implemented.

Define the clear purpose. For example, If you are creating a cryptocurrency for a peer-to-peer marketplace then the focus should be on ensuring the efficiency of the transactions.

Identify the problem:

Determine the Unique value proposition: Consider the elements on the basis that you can classify your cryptocurrency differently from others. It can be a unique feature, a better security mechanism, or a newer use case.

Example: If you're creating a cryptocurrency for a decentralized marketplace, your goal might be to facilitate transactions efficiently and securely.

Target Audience: Determine who will use your cryptocurrency and why. Pick if your cryptocurrency should run on a public blockchain that's open to all or a private one that's not. Like, Bitcoin runs on a public one, but you use Hyperledger Fabric for the private kind.

So let's say you're making a cryptocurrency for this secret finance company. Would you go with the public or the private blockchain? What's your reason?

Competitive Analysis: Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for positioning your cryptocurrency effectively. By studying existing cryptocurrencies, you can identify their strengths and weaknesses and determine how your cryptocurrency can stand out.

Key factors to consider:

Example: Research existing cryptocurrencies in the decentralized marketplace space like Ethereum and its ERC-20 tokens that are designed specifically for DeFi.

Public vs. Private: Decide whether your cryptocurrency will operate on a public blockchain (accessible to everyone) or a private blockchain (restricted access).

Example: Bitcoin operates on a public blockchain, while Hyperledger Fabric is used for private blockchains.

To learn more about the types and architecture of Blockchain, check this out! Public vs Private Blockchain. This could help you decide which way to go in the design phase.

This is an important step in the design of blockchain systems since consensus mechanisms determine how transactions are verified and added to their global state. Which consensus mechanism you opt for also affects the security, scalability, and energy efficiency of your cryptocurrency.

One must be wondering, what are consensus Mechanisms exactly?

Consensus Mechanisms are a set of protocols that the participating nodes(computers) in the distributed ledger of blockchain need to agree upon, after which the validation of transactions and creation of blocks takes place.

Proof of Work (PoW): Miners solve difficult math problems to determine which will add the next block onto the blockchain

Working Principle:

Example: PoW by Bitcoin is very secure but drains a lot of energy and unfortunately also less scalable.

Proof of Stake (PoS): Validators are selected to produce new blocks according to their applicable share of the network stake (#tokens held). Ethereum 2.0 uses PoS -- which is more energy-efficient and scalable than ACG-based (PoW), e.g., mining nodes on Bitcoin blockchains'.

Working Principle:

Example: Then PoS is a better idea than PoW, in case you are prioritizing scale-out of an energy-efficient system. For example, Ethereum 2.0 moved from PoW to PoS to solve the problem of scalability and environmental issues.

There are more types of consensus and a detailed description is provided in this article. Consensus Mechanism

This includes the way your cryptocurrency is governed, its total circulating supply as well as any incentives it brings to participants. Tokenomics tells you about the economic model your cryptocurrency will have, which includes its supply and distribution along with the incentives.

Types of Models:

Supply Model: The supply model of the crypto deals with how the total number of coins would be managed with time.

The supply model impacts scarcity and supply, Dilution and inflation as well as the overall economic model.

Distribution Model: The distribution model decides the initial allocation and further user distribution of the coins.

The Distribution model impacts the early investments, access, and initial distribution.

Example: Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, creating a sense of scarcity that can drive value. Alternatively, some cryptocurrencies use an inflationary model where new tokens are created over time to reward validators and maintain network security.

As you dive into cryptocurrencies, you need to decide if you're gonna whip up a fresh blockchain or just craft a token using an existing one. Both ways have their perks and hurdles. This section serves up the essential steps for both paths dishing out a guide for blockchain whizzes.

Depending on your requirements, you can either choose to create a new blockchain or go with creating a token on the existing blockchain.

Example: Building a new blockchain from scratch might involve using C++ (like Bitcoin) or Rust (like Polkadot).

For a Token on an Existing Blockchain:

For projects that don't essentially need a new blockchain, we can create a token on top of the existing blockchain which is more efficient and pocket-friendly.

1. Choose a Platform: Select the appropriate blockchain platform according to your requirements

2. Develop the Smart Contract: Write the smart contract code for your token. This includes specifying the token's name, symbol, total supply, and how it can be transferred.

Developing the smart contract includes the steps as follows:

3. Deploy the Smart Contract: Deploy the smart contract to the chosen blockchain network. For deployment first carry out the test deployment on the deployment environments and once it is successful go for the mainnnet deployment.

Example: Create an ERC-20 token using Solidity on Ethereum with a contract that defines the token's behavior.

Wallet Integration: Ensure that your cryptocurrency is compatible with popular cryptocurrency wallets.

Exchange Listings: Get your cryptocurrency listed on exchanges for trading. Listing your cryptocurrency on exchanges is vital because it allows for liquidity and trading.

Example: For an ERC-20 token, integration with MetaMask and listing on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap would be key steps.

Security is the heart and soul of blockchain technology. When you're developing a digital currency, there's simply no room for shortcuts when it comes to protecting your system. Every step of the way -- whether you're designing the blockchain, writing code, or planning the launch -- security has to be your top priority.

Think of it as building a fortress around your currency. If there's even a small crack in the walls, everything inside is at risk. That's why, from day one, you need to be thinking about how to safeguard your currency from potential threats. Missing this step isn't just risky -- it's unthinkable. It's what keeps your users' trust intact and ensures that your currency can thrive in the wild world of digital finance.

Hence, Auditing the code before deployment is the biggest and most important step.

Example: Conduct audits through firms like ConsenSys Diligence or Trail of Bits.

When you've finished developing and securing your digital currency, the next big step is the launch. This is where all your hard work, sleepless nights, and meticulous planning come together. The launch is more than just flipping a switch -- it's the moment your vision becomes a reality and your currency steps into the world.

Remember, a strong launch sets the tone for everything that follows. By combining technical excellence with a thoughtful, user-centered approach, you're not just launching a currency -- you're launching a movement.

Example: Regularly update your token's smart contract and address any security issues that arise. Stay on top of your crypto game by sprucing up your token's smart contract. Squash those pesky bugs, give the features a boost, and slam the door on security threats to make sure your crypto stays winning

Creating digital currency demands knowing the big ideas and techy bits, like figuring out why you're making it doing your homework on buyers, building the blockchain, keeping it safe, and handling the big release. It starts with a solid grasp of blockchain technology, moves through careful planning and design, and requires a strong focus on security to keep everything safe.

But that's not all. You also need to think about how your currency will be used, how to build trust with your users, and how to make sure it can grow over time. The launch is just the beginning; the real challenge is maintaining and improving your currency as the market evolves. By combining tech skills with creativity and strategic thinking, you can create a digital currency that not only works well but also captures people's imagination and stands the test of time.

How to Buy Waves (WAVES) * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-waves-waves,2024-09-09,Benzinga,"Wondering how to buy Waves and want to jump straight to the answer? You can buy WAVES today on Binance.US!

The Waves blockchain is an open-source platform for developers. It enables the creation of tokens and decentralized applications (dApps), similar to Ethereum. One of the key advantages of Waves is its simplicity. It does not require complicated smart contract technology, which is often needed for launching a cryptocurrency. This feature streamlines the process of token and platform development. The Waves network employs a combination of full nodes and light nodes. This structure supports the rapid creation of tokens and the development of decentralized applications.

If you're looking to diversify your cryptocurrency holdings, Waves may be a good option to do so. It competes with Ethereum but stands out in the blockchain sector. In this guide, Benzinga breaks down the step-by-step process on how to purchase WAVES easily and securely.

Follow these easy and simple steps to successfully purchase WAVES.

To buy any type of cryptocurrency, usually you open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that offers the token you're interested in. To create an account, you'll submit a bit of personal information which may include your email address, phone number, your full legal name and home address. You may also be required to submit a copy of your driver's license, military ID or passport for verification process.

After your account is open, you'll be able to transfer funds and make a deposit. Many trading platforms facilitate payments through credit card or debit card, wire transfer and cryptocurrency deposit sourced from other exchanges and wallets. Choose your preferred payment method, follow the instructions, enter the deposit amount, and confirm any transaction fees.

When your account is funded, you'll be able to place a buy order. Most crypto brokers offer access to multiple order types. The type of order that you place will determine how likely you are to see your order filled and the price you'll pay for each coin. Here's a look at two of the most common order types you'll likely have access to through your crypto broker.

After you place your order, your broker will fill it following your instructions. If your order is filled, you'll see your coins in your trading account.

WAVES is a blockchain platform that simplifies the creation and management of digital assets and decentralized applications. It was launched in 2016 by Sasha Ivanov.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a tool that gives you more control and protection when you store your tokens. There are two major types of crypto wallets: software and hardware wallets. A software wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that must be connected to the internet in order to access your tokens. A hardware wallet, on the other hand, stores your tokens offline on a physical device.

If you plan on holding onto your crypto for a significant amount of time, we recommend storing your tokens in an offline, cold storage wallet. If you don't already have a cryptocurrency wallet that's compatible with ERC-20 tokens like Waves, consider a few of our top choices below.

Ledger is among the most popular hardware wallets available and is best known for its high level of cold-storage security. It supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including ERC-20 tokens, Ethereum and Bitcoin. The device features Bluetooth compatibility for accessing decentralized applications and can be quickly connected to a smartphone using the Ledger Live app.

The Ellipal cold storage wallet supports over 7,000 tokens across 35 blockchains, making it highly compatible for storing multiple cryptocurrencies. It features a sleek design and a bright screen for easy management of holdings, with monthly updates adding new supported assets.

After your order is filled, you need to decide if you want to actively trade your Waves coins or if you want to hold them long-term. If you decide to hold long-term, we recommend moving your coins into your hardware wallet as soon as your order is filled. This ensures maximum security and greatly limits the chance of being involved in a hack.

If you decide to become an active trader, you'll capitalize on small price movements throughout the day and week instead of holding your coins long term. You may want to convert your Waves to a stablecoin (like Tether or USD). When the price of Waves rises, convert back to Waves when the price drops again.

The cryptocurrency market experiences significant volatility. Major cryptocurrencies can fluctuate by 6% up or down on a daily basis. Here's a quick look at how the crypto market is moving today.

Adding altcoins to your cryptocurrency portfolio can be an excellent way to introduce more diversification into your investment collection. However, remember that the cryptocurrency market is still widely unregulated. If you do decide to invest in Waves (or any other coin), never invest more money than you can comfortably afford to lose.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/16161721/waves.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.1607843137254903
What is Trust wallet?,https://www.theblock.co/learn/313730/what-is-trust-wallet,2024-09-01,The Block,"Trust Wallet TWT -4.83% TWT -4.83% See Details is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to store, manage and engage with various digital assets. It supports numerous cryptocurrencies, including popular ones like bitcoin, ether, ERC-20 tokens, Solana and nonfungible tokens. It is available as a mobile app on Android and iOS platforms and as a browser extension.

History and development of Trust Wallet

Trust Wallet was founded in 2017 by Ukrainian software developer Viktor Radchenko. Radchenko explained in an interview that his motivations for building the wallet were to make crypto more accessible and that he wanted a way to store his tokens on his phone. The first version of Trust Wallet was released just two weeks after he began.

Initially, Trust Wallet was designed as a simple wallet for storing ERC-20 and ERC-223 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. However, as the cryptocurrency market expanded and diversified, so did its functionality, which grew to support additional blockchains and their tokens, such as Solana.

In July 2018, Trust Wallet was acquired by Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, making the wallet the official on-chain wallet for the exchange. The acquisition enabled Trust Wallet to integrate with Binance's ecosystem and provided Binance users with an on-chain mobile wallet. Since the acquisition, Trust Wallet has continued to develop, adding support for multiple blockchains, decentralized applications and staking features.

In 2022, Radchenko stepped down as CEO of Trust Wallet to focus on his family and was replaced by Eowyn Chen, former Marketing Vice President at Binance.

In 2023, Trust Wallet partnered with Moonpay and Ramp to provide users with fiat off and on ramps, allowing the conversion to fiat directly within the app.

Features and functions

Trust Wallet offers several features and functions that make it a versatile tool for managing digital assets. Trust Wallet claims to support over 10 million tokens from over 100 blockchains, making it one of the most comprehensive wallets available.

In addition to basic wallet features like sending, receiving, and storing digital assets, the app's integration with various decentralized exchanges allows users to trade and swap cryptocurrencies directly within the app.

Trust Wallet also includes a built-in Dapp browser, which allows users to interact with decentralized applications directly from their wallet. This is particularly useful for participating in decentralized finance DeFi activities.

Additionally, Trust Wallet allows users to stake certain cryptocurrencies directly from their wallet, earning rewards as additional tokens. The wallet also supports the storage and management of NFTs. Through its integrations with Moonpay and Ramp, Trust Wallet also supports purchases of crypto with fiat directly within the app.

In terms of security features, the app offers biometric authentication and an in-built security scanner, which provides warnings about potentially risky transactions to help protect users from scams.

What's needed to set up a Trust Wallet account?

Setting up a Trust Wallet account is a straightforward process.

First, users need to download the app, which is free on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, or download the browser extension. After installing the app on their chosen device, users can follow the prompts to create a new wallet.

Trust Wallet will then generate a 12-word recovery phrase, which users must securely store, as it is the only way to recover their wallet if they lose access to their device.

After creating the wallet, users can enhance security by enabling biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) and setting a passcode.

Once the wallet is set up, users can add cryptocurrencies by purchasing them through the app, receiving them from another wallet, or transferring them from an exchange.

What is Trust Wallet Token?

Trust Wallet Token was launched in 2020 and serves as the native utility token within the Trust Wallet ecosystem. TWT holders can participate in governance decisions, influencing the platform's future by voting on matters such as which blockchains should be supported, as well as gaining access to discounts, payment options, and other benefits.

While Trust Wallet is generally considered secure, there are some risks with using non-custodial wallets, since users are solely responsible for their private keys. Losing the 12-word recovery phrase means losing access to the wallet and the funds stored within it.

Users also need to be vigilant against phishing attacks, where malicious actors attempt to steal private keys or recovery phrases by posing as legitimate entities. It is important for users to always ensure that they're interacting with the official Trust Wallet website and app.","https://www.tbstat.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,q=75/wp/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-13.09.51.png",0.4666666666666666

Ethereum reached a 52-week intraday high of $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024, and a 52-week intraday low of $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has a global market capitalization of $303.62 billion. Year over year, ETH has increased 54%.

Ethereum market cap

Today, ethereum's $303.62 billion market capitalization is second to bitcoin's. Together, bitcoin and ethereum represent 70% of the entire cryptocurrency market. While ethereum is the leading altcoin, other altcoins have relatively high market capitalizations. These include solana with a market cap of $85.82 billion, XRP at $58.08 billion and everyone's favorite ""meme"" coin DOGE at $14.69 billion.

Bitcoin and ethereum's combined crypto market dominance has fluctuated over the years. But it has trended steadily higher since late 2022.

Ethereum's market cap of $303.62 billion is similar to some major blue-chip stocks, such as the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $308 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $295 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based platform. It facilitates secure financial transactions. The network's native token is ether.

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Ethereum gas price

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Like bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, ethereum had humble beginnings. Shortly after its launch in July 2015, ETH hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

The popularity and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies started to snowball in 2017. ETH prices reached $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. The crypto ultimately peaked at around $1,300 less than two weeks later.

CME Group's announcement that it would launch bitcoin futures contracts drove ethereum's 2017 rally. They were the first cryptocurrency-related products offered by a regulated U.S. financial institution.

Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency died down in 2018. That led to one of several crypto winters in the past decade.

The next crypto boom began in 2020. This time, ETH's parabolic rise was partly driven by government shutdowns of sports, casinos, and other leisure and entertainment options. Multiple government stimulus checks also left many Americans with extra disposable income to buy crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices reached $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled investor enthusiasm for risk assets in 2022. A string of crypto industry layoffs and bankruptcies weighed on crypto prices, culminating in the bankruptcy of leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022. ETH prices dipped below $900 during the 2022 crypto winter.

The ethereum rally resumed in 2023 and into 2024 as investors grew more optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of several bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 further bolstered ethereum prices.

Ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. Some of these funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale. They can be found on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,522.45.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum launched in 2015, ethereum and bitcoin have seen massive growth.

The performance gap between the two shifted with the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. Ethereum is up 54% year over year, compared to a 131% gain for bitcoin.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765
Top 15 Best Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) in 2024,https://cryptopotato.com/best-decentralized-exchanges//,2024-08-18,CryptoPotato,"Decentralized exchanges are the lifeblood of decentralized finance (DeFi), allocating billions of dollars worth in total value locked (TVL) into the industry.

Compared to centralized exchanges (CEXs), DEXs only account for a small percentage of the total trading volumes across margin and derivatives trading. However, they're becoming increasingly more sophisticated with time. They provide some of the same benefits and features found within CEXs but also offer a trustless environment without third parties and some perks of their own.

In this article, we aim to provide comprehensive information on the top DEXs in 2024, covering key details about each protocol, including:

There are numerous DEXs across various chains, each offering unique capabilities, benefits, and drawbacks. Whether you're looking to swap assets, provide liquidity, or take leveraged positions, this article will equip you with all the necessary information.

Thanks to smart contracts, decentralized exchanges provide a trustless environment and peer-to-peer trading. These self-executing contracts have the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically match and execute trades between users transparently and auditably on the blockchain.

DEXs give users more control over their funds as they're not custodial platforms. Therefore, you interact with them using your wallet, allowing you to manage, store, and trade your crypto at your own will.

However, DEXs are as safe as their smart contracts.

However, bugs or exploits in the smart contracts can be targeted by malicious actors, leading to potential fund loss. To address these and other security-related concerns, most protocols nowadays audit their smart contracts and overall infrastructure with blockchain analytics firms and auditors to test and find potential threats before and after launch.

However, the risks of exploits or hacks are always present, especially on new platforms that experiment with new technologies or features that might present potential vulnerabilities due to their lack of testing.

As always, users must do their research and safeguard their assets in self-custody wallets before using a DEX.

With all of the above out of the way, let's move on to some of the best DEXs in 2024.

The following protocols were chosen based on crucial elements and characteristics: trading volume, foundations, competitive features, fees, TVL, market capitalization, founders, and other important considerations.

Uniswap (UNI) is the largest decentralized exchange by total value locked (TVL) and market capitalization.

Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Uniswap is the pioneer of the automated market maker (AMM) protocol. This protocol automates crypto transactions through algorithms that set token prices based on the ratio of assets in a given liquidity pool.

In simpler words, the AMM model quotes the prices automatically in liquidity pools, automating crypto transactions and providing liquidity across markets. This is done through the constant product formula.

Following the introduction of V3, Uniswap employs a tiered fee structure. Multiple liquidity pools for each token pair, each with distinct swapping fees, are available. Liquidity providers can choose from three fee tiers: 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1%.

You can check Uniswap Docs for more information.

Uniswap was founded by Hayden Adams in 2018. He's a former mechanical engineer at Siemens who created Uniswap as a decentralized exchange that uses automated functions and trustless smart contracts instead of intermediaries.

Supported wallets for Uniswap include MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and others compatible with Ethereum. A perk is that many of these wallets can be connected to a hardware wallet, therefore allowing you to transfer your funds to cold storage.

You can also store UNI in a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor, a convenient way to store your funds offline.

dYdX is one of the top DEXs for derivatives, allowing users to trade perpetual futures contracts across a wide range of over 35 cryptocurrencies, including coins like BTC, ETH, and SOL.

It was built on the Ethereum blockchain and established in August 2017 by Antonio Juliano, a former engineer at Coinbase. The protocol has gone through multiple phases of development, continually enhancing its product offerings and user benefits, and even transitioned to the Ethereum layer-2 solution, Starkware, in 2022.

dYdX is distinguished by several core features, emphasizing decentralization and user accessibility:

Like other DEXs in this list, dYdX uses a tiered maker-taker fee structure where rates depend on the 30-day trading activity and order types. In other words, eligible traders who trade volumes over $100,000 and under $1 million within 30 days pay a maker fee of 0.020% and a taker fee of 0.050% on every trade.

Antonio Juliano founded dYdX in August 2017, bringing his experience as a software engineer at Coinbase, where he worked from 2014 to 2017.

dYdX supports a wide range of wallets, including some of the most popular options in the market. These include:

PancakeSwap is a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Launched in September 2020 by anonymous developers, PancakeSwap utilizes an automated market maker (AMM) model, enabling users to swap BEP20 tokens directly from their wallets without requiring any account registration.

The platform has garnered substantial popularity due to low costs, fast transaction processing, and a broad range of services, including yield farming, staking, crypto games, NFTs, and even a lottery program.

PancakeSwap's ecosystem is supported by an active community of CAKE holders, who use the token to provide liquidity to pools, pay for transaction fees, participate in governance, and more.

PancakeSwap offers many features designed to enhance the user experience and promote active engagement within the platform. These features include:

PancakeSwap pays out 0.17% to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward to liquidity providers. 0.0225% is sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury, and 0.0575 goes to CAKE buyback and burn.

For perpetual trading, fees depend on the chain. Both opening and closing positions are 0.08% on BSC, opBNB, and Base, and on Arbitrum, they are 0.05%. Note that you can get a 5% discount on trading fees if you pay them with CAKE.

The team behind PancakeSwap, often called ""the Chefs,"" remains anonymous, with little publicly disclosed information regarding their identities or backgrounds. That didn't stop them from creating one of the best DEXs in the crypto industry.

PancakeSwap was launched on the Binance Smart Chain instead of Ethereum, taking advantage of BSC's high throughput, scalability, and low transaction costs.

PancakeSwap supports a variety of cryptocurrency wallets, enabling users to connect and interact with the platform easily. Supported wallets include:

SundaeSwap is a top DEX on the Cardano blockchain. Launched in early 2022, It is one of the few Cardano-based protocols operating through an AMM model. This allows users to exchange Cardano-based tokens directly through smart contracts without relying on a centralized intermediary.

SundaeSwap has a rather complex exchange fee tier, but you can find them from 1% to 0.3% and even 0.1%. Note the platform only performs trades through swap. There's no such thing as a spot market in SundaeSwap.

SundaeSwap was co-founded by Artem Wright and Mateen Motavaf. Wright is the CEO, while Motavaf is the COO.

To interact with the SundaeSwap platform, users can connect through several supported wallets, including:

SunSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the TRON blockchain, designed specifically for trading TRC20 tokens.

Initially launched in 2020, SunSwap is an upgraded version of JustSwap, which SUN.io acquired in October 2021. The platform has become one of the most successful and popular blockchain projects within the TRON ecosystem, combining features such as stablecoin swapping, token mining, and self-governance.

SunSwap offers a range of features that make it a versatile and user-friendly platform for trading TRC20 tokens:

SunSwap charges a transaction fee of 0.3% on all trades conducted on the platform. Of this fee, 0.05% is allocated to the buyback and burning of the SUN token, a process designed to increase the token's value over time.

SunSwap was created after Sun.io acquired JustSwap for rebranding.

You can connect a TronLink wallet or use some popular options like WalletConnect, Bitget Wallet, OKX, Ledger, and more.

Osmosis is one of the best DEXs on the Cosmos blockchain, designed to facilitate cross-chain trading and liquidity provision.

Like other protocols, it functions as an AMM, providing users with the best quotes and prices for their tokens and swaps. It uses the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) to connect with over 50 different blockchains, allowing for seamless asset trading across multiple networks.

The platform's native token, OSMO, is integral to the Osmosis ecosystem, serving as the main currency for trading and governance. Users can earn rewards by contributing liquidity to various pools and participating in governance decisions.

Sunny Aggarwal and Josh Lee, both of whom have deep roots in the blockchain industry, co-founded Osmosis.

Aggarwal is well-known for his work on the popular Cosmos wallet, Keplr, and has been active in crypto since 2015. His expertise in decentralized technologies and community-driven projects has been instrumental in Osmosis's growth.

With his experience in the Cosmos ecosystem, Lee has focused on enhancing interoperability and improving user experience, contributing to the platform's development and adoption.

Osmosis charges a 0.3% fee per swap on its platform. This fee is distributed among liquidity providers, incentivizing them to contribute to the pools.

Osmosis supports Keplr, Station, Leap, OKX Wallet, XDEFI, Cosmostation, and Crypto.com Wallet.

Curve (CRV) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to trade stablecoins efficiently.

It's one of the top DEXs, with over $2 billion worth of TVL (as of June 2024).

Curve has been audited multiple times, including during the protocol's pre-launch. Several renowned firms, including ChainSecurity and QuantStamp audited it. Trail of Bits (TOB) has previously fixed bugs and vulnerabilities, reinforcing Curve's security and operability.

Curve Finance is known for its low fees. The platform charges a flat trading fee of 0.04%, significantly lower than many other DEXs.

Curve was founded in 2020 by Michael Egorov, who has a background in physics, cryptography, and quantum computing. He previously served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of NuCypher, an encryption layer for big data platforms.

Curve supports a variety of wallets, including, but not limited to:

Balancer is one of the biggest DEXs in the DeFi market, offering self-balancing pools that can be customized according to the owner's needs.

Balancer uses algorithms to manage and incentivize interactions between liquidity providers, liquidity pools, and traders.

Balancer can be viewed as the DeFi version of a traditional index fund, but it operates decentralized and permissionless; users can create their own trading pools, including up to eight different cryptocurrencies. These pools are self-balancing, meaning Balancer automatically adjusts the token supply within the pool to maintain a specific ratio.

In Balancer, pool fees are determined by the owner, allowing them to set different fees for various pairs, ranging from 0.0001% to 10%. The pool detail page in the user interface provides information on the pool type and fee management.

Note that fees influence the determination of the optimal price when using the Smart Order Router, a tool designed for developers. Likewise, some pools use Dynamic Trade Fees, which Gauntlet algorithmically sets.

Fernando Martinelli and Mike McDonald founded Balancer.

Balancer Labs, a technology company specializing in blockchain-based products, oversees the development of the Balancer Protocol. Both founders have a significant background in building and developing successful companies within the blockchain space.

Balancer supports MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect, which means you can use all of the wallets available in WalletConnect to interact with the DEX.

Raydium (RAY) is the largest Solana-based decentralized exchange dominating the market with a TVL often north of $950M. The protocol competes closely with Jupiter regarding trading volume, often alternating in daily performance.

The platform offers token swaps, liquidity provision, and yield farming using an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm. Additionally, Raydium's Acceleraytor serves as a launchpad for initial DEX offerings (IDOs) of new Solana projects.

A significant feature of Raydium is the OpenBook, which combines Raydium's AMM with an order book model. However, it should be noted that Raydium's AMM is quite different from Uniswap or the general models in the market today.

Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) allows Raydium's liquidity providers to select a specific price range at which liquidity is most active for trades within a pool. This contrasts Uniswap's constant product AMM pools, where all liquidity is spread out on a price curve from 0 to infinity.

Raydium employs a detailed fee structure. A typical trading fee of 0.25% is applied for each swap in a pool. This fee is allocated to reward liquidity providers, perform RAY token buybacks, and fund the Raydium treasury.

Fees from Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) pool trades are automatically converted to USDC and transferred to a designated address controlled by the Squads Multi-sig to cover RPC expenses.

In CLMM pools, trading fees vary across four tiers: 100 basis points (bps), 25 bps, 5 bps, or 1 bp. Of the total fee, 84% goes to liquidity providers, 12% to RAY buybacks, and 4% to the treasury.

To create a standard AMM pool, users must pay 0.4 SOL. This fee helps prevent spam and supports the protocol's sustainability.

Raydium was founded by AlphaRay, XRay, GammaRay, and StingRay. These pseudonymous founders claim to have backgrounds in traditional finance, trading, and blockchain development. However, specific details about their previous works are not publicly disclosed due to their preference for anonymity

Raydium supports a variety of wallets, including:

The RAY token can be stored on different hardware wallets, such as Ledger and Trezor.

Jupiter is a DEX aggregator built on the Solana blockchain, designed to provide users with the best rates for token swaps by aggregating liquidity from multiple DEXs protocols.

Jupiter facilitates token swaps with minimal slippage and low fees. It boasts a user-friendly interface suitable for both novice and experienced traders, supporting hundreds of tokens and thousands of trading pairs.

Jupiter also emphasizes developer tools, making DApp and interface integration straightforward. It offers:

Jupiter itself does not charge transaction fees but has fees for specific features. Here's a breakdown:

The co-founder of Jupiter goes by the pseudonym Meow. Meow has appeared often in podcasts and interviews and is quite active in their social media account.

Which Wallets Does Jupiter Support

Jupiter is compatible with many reputable wallets, including those from Solana and Ethereum. Examples include:

Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Coinbase's Base blockchain, engineered to facilitate efficient token swapping with minimal slippage and low transaction fees.

The protocol employs advanced algorithms and liquidity pools designed to optimize the trading experience by reducing the difference between expected and executed trade prices, known as slippage.

The platform uses two tokens, AERO and veAERO. AERO is the native token distributed to liquidity providers, while veAERO is used for governance.

Users can lock their AERO tokens to receive veAERO, which allows them to participate in the platform's decision-making processes.

Aerodrome charges 0.2% for swaps, one of the lowest fees in the market. All revenues and fees are distributed to VELO holders and network participants.

Aerodrome launched in August 2023 on the Base network, launched by the decentralized trading protocol Velodrom (VELO), built on Optimism (OP), one of Ethereum's largest layer-2 solutions.

Aerodrome supports Browser Wallet, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and Safe. It does not support MetaMask as of June 2024.

SushiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum. It supports a wide range of tokens and offers users the opportunity to earn rewards through various mechanisms, such as staking and liquidity provision.

SushiSwap is praised for its simple yet versatile community-driven protocol. The protocol was initially created as a fork of Uniswap and created its own suite of DeFi products, offering features such as trading, liquidity provision, lending, staking, and advanced tools like MISO and Trident.

SushiSwap charges a 0.3% fee for token swaps, which is divided between liquidity providers (0.25%) and SUSHI stakers (0.05%). You can refer to SushiSwap's documentation page for more information.

SushiSwap was founded by an anonymous developer, Chef Nomi, who later transferred control to a community governance model after a controversial exit. The current development is overseen by a team of developers and a community of users actively participating in governance and decision-making processes.

SushiSwap supports many cryptocurrency wallets, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, Exodus, and others compatible with Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.

GMX is a popular derivatives exchange operating on the Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchains. It allows users to trade various cryptocurrencies with leverage up to 50x, catering to casual and experienced traders.

A distinctive feature of GMX is its Multi-Asset Liquidity Pool (GLP), which combines stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. This pool acts as the counterparty for all trades on the platform, enabling liquidity providers to earn fees from trading activity while minimizing risks like impermanent loss.

GMX also employs Chainlink oracles for accurate pricing, ensuring that prices reflect the broader market and protecting users from liquidation during volatile periods.

1inch is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that facilitates cryptocurrency swaps across multiple decentralized platforms, offering users optimal prices and reduced transaction fees.

The platform operates using an advanced algorithm called Pathfinder, which analyzes various potential swap paths across different exchanges to ensure the best prices.

Pathfinder can split a single trade into smaller transactions across multiple DEXs, minimizing slippage -- the difference between the expected and actual trade prices -- by enhancing liquidity. This method helps users avoid the pitfalls of low trading volumes on individual platforms and ensures more favorable pricing.

Moreover, the platform is powered by the 1INCH token, which serves as both a utility and governance token. It enables holders to participate in the 1inch DAO and earn rewards through staking and liquidity provision.

Orca is one of the best Solana DEXs, launched in February 2021. It is designed to offer fast, low-cost cryptocurrency trading with a focus on providing a user-friendly experience, making it accessible to both beginners and seasoned traders in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

The platform operates on an AMM model, which uses algorithms to provide liquidity and execute trades without needing a centralized order book. It also features a concentrated liquidity model, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their assets more effectively within specific price ranges, thereby increasing capital efficiency and potentially boosting earnings from trading fees.

Leveraging the speed and low costs of the Solana blockchain, Orca offers transactions with fees as low as $0.00002 and finality within approximately one second, making it an attractive platform for cost-conscious and time-sensitive users.

When choosing a decentralized exchange (DEX), it's essential to consider several key factors to ensure a secure, efficient, and satisfactory trading experience.

Liquidity is crucial for seamless trading on a DEX. High liquidity means you can execute large trades quickly without significantly affecting the market price.

DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap are known for their substantial liquidity pools, which help minimize slippage and provide a stable trading environment. Ample liquidity also indicates a healthy and trusted platform.

The user interface and overall experience of a DEX can vary widely. Platforms like Uniswap and SushiSwap offer user-friendly interfaces catering to beginners and experienced traders.

Choosing a DEX with a straightforward and intuitive interface is important, making the trading process easier and more enjoyable. However, remember that straightforward does not necessarily mean simple or limited, as several DEXs offer advanced tools for more experienced users, such as margin trading, leverage, derivatives trading, and detailed charting tools and indicators.

Look for DEXs with robust security measures, including the use of well-audited smart contracts by reputable analytics and auditing companies and the ability to connect directly with hardware wallets for enhanced protection.

Some platforms also offer bug bounties to incentivize discovering and fixing vulnerabilities. However, smart contract vulnerabilities remain a major bottleneck for the sector. It's always advisable to move your crypto assets into a hardware wallet.

Check the range of tokens supported by the DEX. Leading DEXs like Uniswap support various ERC-20 tokens, while PancakeSwap focuses on BNB Chain tokens. If you have specific tokens you wish to trade, ensure they are listed on the DEX you choose. Additionally, consider how new tokens are listed and the ease of adding new assets.

Trading fees can significantly impact your profitability. DEXs typically have lower fees than centralized exchanges, but these can still vary.

For example, SushiSwap charges a 0.3% fee on swaps, while others like dYdX offer different fees based on the trading pair and volume. It's essential to review the fee structure of a DEX to understand all potential costs, including any network fees associated with transactions-

Consider liquidity, user experience, security measures, supported tokens, and trading fees to decide which decentralized exchange best meets your trading needs. Conduct thorough research and possibly test a DEX with a small trade before committing larger amounts.

In conclusion, selecting the best decentralized exchange involves considering key factors such as liquidity, user experience, security measures, supported tokens, and trading fees.

By researching these aspects and testing a DEX with small trades, you can find a platform that meets your trading needs while providing a secure and cost-effective environment.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/top_dex_cover.jpg,0.2

Raydium (RAY) is the largest Solana-based decentralized exchange dominating the market with a TVL often north of $950M. The protocol competes closely with Jupiter regarding trading volume, often alternating in daily performance.

The platform offers token swaps, liquidity provision, and yield farming using an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm. Additionally, Raydium's Acceleraytor serves as a launchpad for initial DEX offerings (IDOs) of new Solana projects.

A significant feature of Raydium is the OpenBook, which combines Raydium's AMM with an order book model. However, it should be noted that Raydium's AMM is quite different from Uniswap or the general models in the market today.

Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) allows Raydium's liquidity providers to select a specific price range at which liquidity is most active for trades within a pool. This contrasts Uniswap's constant product AMM pools, where all liquidity is spread out on a price curve from 0 to infinity.

Raydium employs a detailed fee structure. A typical trading fee of 0.25% is applied for each swap in a pool. This fee is allocated to reward liquidity providers, perform RAY token buybacks, and fund the Raydium treasury.

Fees from Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) pool trades are automatically converted to USDC and transferred to a designated address controlled by the Squads Multi-sig to cover RPC expenses.

In CLMM pools, trading fees vary across four tiers: 100 basis points (bps), 25 bps, 5 bps, or 1 bp. Of the total fee, 84% goes to liquidity providers, 12% to RAY buybacks, and 4% to the treasury.

To create a standard AMM pool, users must pay 0.4 SOL. This fee helps prevent spam and supports the protocol's sustainability.

Raydium was founded by AlphaRay, XRay, GammaRay, and StingRay. These pseudonymous founders claim to have backgrounds in traditional finance, trading, and blockchain development. However, specific details about their previous works are not publicly disclosed due to their preference for anonymity

Raydium supports a variety of wallets, including:

The RAY token can be stored on different hardware wallets, such as Ledger and Trezor.

It also features a concentrated liquidity model, allowing liquidity providers to allocate their assets more effectively within specific price ranges, thereby increasing capital efficiency and potentially boosting earnings from trading fees.

Leveraging the speed and low costs of the Solana blockchain, Orca offers transactions with fees as low as $0.00002 and finality within approximately one second, making it an attractive platform for cost-conscious and time-sensitive users.

When choosing a decentralized exchange (DEX), it's essential to consider several key factors to ensure a secure, efficient, and satisfactory trading experience.

Liquidity is crucial for seamless trading on a DEX. High liquidity means you can execute large trades quickly without significantly affecting the market price.

DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap are known for their substantial liquidity pools, which help minimize slippage and provide a stable trading environment. Ample liquidity also indicates a healthy and trusted platform.

The user interface and overall experience of a DEX can vary widely. Platforms like Uniswap and SushiSwap offer user-friendly interfaces catering to beginners and experienced traders.

Choosing a DEX with a straightforward and intuitive interface is important, making the trading process easier and more enjoyable. However, remember that straightforward does not necessarily mean simple or limited, as several DEXs offer advanced tools for more experienced users, such as margin trading, leverage, derivatives trading, and detailed charting tools and indicators.

Look for DEXs with robust security measures, including the use of well-audited smart contracts by reputable analytics and auditing companies and the ability to connect directly with hardware wallets for enhanced protection.

Some platforms also offer bug bounties to incentivize discovering and fixing vulnerabilities. However, smart contract vulnerabilities remain a major bottleneck for the sector. It's always advisable to move your crypto assets into a hardware wallet.

Check the range of tokens supported by the DEX. Leading DEXs like Uniswap support various ERC-20 tokens, while PancakeSwap focuses on BNB Chain tokens. If you have specific tokens you wish to trade, ensure they are listed on the DEX you choose. Additionally, consider how new tokens are listed and the ease of adding new assets.

Trading fees can significantly impact your profitability. DEXs typically have lower fees than centralized exchanges, but these can still vary.

For example, SushiSwap charges a 0.3% fee on swaps, while others like dYdX offer different fees based on the trading pair and volume. It's essential to review the fee structure of a DEX to understand all potential costs, including any network fees associated with transactions-

Consider liquidity, user experience, security measures, supported tokens, and trading fees to decide which decentralized exchange best meets your trading needs. Conduct thorough research and possibly test a DEX with a small trade before committing larger amounts.

In conclusion, selecting the best decentralized exchange involves considering key factors such as liquidity, user experience, security measures, supported tokens, and trading fees.

By researching these aspects and testing a DEX with small trades, you can find a platform that meets your trading needs while providing a secure and cost-effective environment.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/top_dex_cover.jpg,0.2

Enhanced security measures, like multi-factor authentication and hardware wallets, are essential to safeguard assets.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1724780446/Whats_App_Image_2024_08_27_at_18_36_06_0d355c59ce.jpg,0.4666666666666666
"""Sustainably"" Surveilling & Tokenizing Nature: The Case of O.N.E. Amazon",https://thewashingtonstandard.com/sustainably-surveilling-tokenizing-nature-the-case-of-o-n-e-amazon/,2024-08-31,The Washington Standard,"Home""World""""Sustainably"" Surveilling & Tokenizing Nature: The Case of O.N.E. Amazon World ""Sustainably"" Surveilling & Tokenizing Nature: The Case of O.N.E. Amazon Whitney Webb 2024-08-31 Whitney Webb / August 31, 2024 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp

A satellite surveillance company with links to U.S. intelligence, former Trump administration officials, U.S. government debt barons and the stablecoin Tether (USDT) announced plans earlier this year to build the ""Internet for Forests"" in the Amazon rainforest. The satellite company, called Satellogic, plans to join an initiative to rig up one of the world's oldest and most important forests with sensors and ""machine intelligence infrastructure"" led by a group called O.N.E. Amazon. O.N.E. Amazon, in turn, seeks to turn the Amazon rainforest into a digital asset security to be chopped up, tokenized and sold off to investors around the world as a novel form of digital credit. O.N.E. Amazon's partners in this endeavor, such as Aecom, also have important U.S. intelligence connections.

O.N.E. Amazon is chaired by Peter Knez, who oversaw the creation of ETFs (exchange traded funds) and iShares, which is now owned by BlackRock. Knez, who also served for many years as BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Officer, also chairs the Venom Foundation, which is developing a proprietary blockchain and token to facilitate the ""development and implementation of central bank digital currency (CBDC) and traditional finance products by governments and businesses"" around the world. Given that O.N.E. Amazon describes its rainforest tokenization initiative as ""crypto with a purpose"" and that it is also chaired by Knez, it seems likely that the Amazon-focused initiative may involve Venom in some capacity. Given Satellogic's ties to past efforts to impose a Bitcoin blockchain-powered carbon market on Latin America, it is also possible that Bitcoin or another prominent blockchain will be used, especially considering the involvement of Jalak Jobanputra, a major investor in the digital currency space and particularly in important Bitcoin-related companies, in allegedly co-founding O.N.E. Amazon.

As we previously reported earlier this year in a piece entitled Tokenized Inc., BlackRock and other titans of finance are attempting to tokenize and financialize the natural world. Considering that the architect of iShares now stands at the helm of O.N.E. Amazon, it is important to reflect on BlackRock's Larry Fink's words shortly after the approval of the iShares Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. Fink stated that ""We believe ETFs are a technology no different than Bitcoin was a technology for asset storage."" In other words, blockchain and ETFs, per Fink, merely serve as a technological means to store centralized indexes, funds and tokenized assets, in direct contrast to the founding aspirations of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. Now, the very man who developed BlackRock's ETF machine is seeking to tokenize the Amazon rainforest and transform it into a digital asset of finite supply - essentially turning a major and crucial ecosystem into a ""digital gold"" or bitcoin analogue.

For years, titans of Wall Street like BlackRock have helped saddle South American countries with unprecedented debt levels, robbing them of their economic sovereignty through dollarization or institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Now, they are seeking to turn the continent's most crucial resources into a form of ""digital gold"" that will be enforced by a satellite-sensor system tied to individuals deeply invested in efforts to globalize dollar-denominated debt and also to American intelligence. While the goal is framed as ""conservation"" of the Amazon, the Satellogic-O.N.E. Amazon proposal seeks instead to enable the exploitation of a protected resource like never before while also building a cybernetic surveillance grid into one of nature's greatest monuments - not to ensure the forest's ""health"" - but to ensure the ""integrity"" of the digital asset security it is now poised to uphold.

What is O.N.E. Amazon?

O.N.E. Amazon aims to create ""sustainable impact for the environment and investors by using next-generation technology to bring innovation to conservation."" It was formally launched at COP28 in December 2023 but appears to have begun operations sometime around 2021, if not earlier. The ""innovation"" O.N.E. Amazon offers is related to its issuance of an upcoming,""regulated O.N.E. Amazon Digital Asset Security."" Per O.N.E. Amazon's chairman Peter Knez, ""each security will represent the perceived value of one hectare of biome in the Amazon rainforest, backed by a 30-year preservation agreement over that land."" The amount of securities to be issued will be capped at 750 million, ""corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest."" In other words, each security issued represents one hectare of the Amazon. Knez stated in an interview with TradeArabia that the group has already secured ""an impressive long-term land preservation agreement for 50 million hectares of rainforest, an area larger than Spain."" The company asserts that ""investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the security"" in large part due to ""the finite size"" of the rainforest it is tokenizing.

Proceeds from purchases of this security will go to the O.N.E. Amazon Impact Found (OAIF), which is headquartered Abu Dhabi, UAE and ""will create jobs for the local Amazonian communities and accelerate the energy transition of the countries through which the Amazon rainforest extends."" At its COP28 launch, O.N.E. Amazon, along with the OAIF, was described as ""the world's first trillion-dollar nature-based asset platform."" Goldman Sachs is the ""structuring partner"" for the fund. The company has also stated that this fund ""will invest in energy transition and circular economy projects, including infrastructure and clean energy generation projects, in addition to more localised community land preservation projects in the Amazon."" It also purports to ""better the lives"" of the millions who inhabit the region.

However, as we shall soon see, O.N.E. Amazon's efforts to-date in the Amazon show that the group, despite claiming to champion ecosystem preservation and indigenous well-being, have acted predatorily with respect to indigenous Amazonian tribes. They are also backing major industrial projects in the countries it operates that do not benefit the local people or environment, arguably the opposite.

In order to help underwrite their digital asset security linked to each hectare of the Amazon rainforest, O.N.E. Amazon plans to build the ""world's first Internet of Forest (IoF)"" in partnership with MIT Media Lab and the aforementioned satellite surveillance company, Satellogic. A percentage of the OAIF will go toward building out the IoF and other investments in Amazon ""data enablement."" MIT Media Lab is specifically helping O.N.E. Amazon create ""a framework to monitor every hectare that is tokenized against a Digital Asset Security"" that will also ""provide a data-driven, real-time understanding of what's happening the Amazon biome."" On its website, O.N.E. Amazon states that the IoF will ""monitor and analyze the health"" of the rainforest while also ""digitally connect[ing] every hectare of land."" According to O.N.E. Amazon co-founder and CEO Rodrigo Veloso, a former board member of Trump Media & Technology Group:

""The Internet of Forests is intended to ensure reliable measurements of key environmental and social metrics; serve as world - class data collection and storage infrastructure for scientific analysis of forest environments; and enable local communities to better understand how their behavior and the behavior of institutions impact the natural environment within the rainforest.""

Chris Lang, contributing editor of the REDD-Monitor substack, revealed in a 2023 report that O.N.E. Amazon has sought to trademark the ""Internet of Forests"" concept since 2021 and that the trademark is intended to cover the following:

""Software as a service; electronic data storage; database development; data analysis and processing; information / data processing; research on agroforestry and agroecological systems; research activities, including the use of apparatus and instruments for activities related to the operation of monitoring and measuring forestry and lands; scanning; advice and consultancy in carrying out tests and measurements for quality control; measurement and verification of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases; aero photogrammetry; photogrammetry; land surveying; topographic surveys; geological surveys; environmental control of air and noise pollution; research in the field of environmental protection; geological research; biological research; providing scientific information, advice and consultancy relating to carbon offsetting; development of technical projects on agroforestry and agroecological systems.""

Given the mentions of carbon dioxide emissions and carbon offsetting, it seems clear that the O.N.E. Amazon security and the ""Internet of Forests"" underwriting it intends to integrate into the broader efforts to impose carbon markets globally. As noted in previous reporting, Latin America has been a major focus for ""green"" bankers and financiers in this regard and O.N.E. Amazon, like groups like GREEN+, are using deeply inequitable contractual agreements made at the local level to implement their plans. The O.N.E. Amazon contracts will be discussed in later detail shortly.

In addition, in a research paper published earlier this year in April, O.N.E. Amazon co-founders Peter Knez and Rodrigo Veloso joined O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea and Mysten Labs to develop an approach where blockchain technology could be integrated into ""biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts."" The paper, entitled ""Preserving Nature's Ledger: Blockchains in Biodiversity Conservation,"" promotes a framework that focuses on ""tokenization strategies for biodiversity species and for IoT solutions, such as sensors, drones, and satellites to monitor and record data related to species and ecosystems.""

The paper notes that the biodiversity data obtained under this framework could be used to develop new green bonds and derivatives that could be traded on a blockchain. To accomplish this, they propose the ""datafication of biodiversity,"" which they define as ""the process of creating digital representations of various species in the ecosystem. They also propose ""data repurposing cascades,"" which refers to ""the process of reusing collected biodiversity data for various purposes [...] that are not necessarily and directly connected to conservation efforts,"" i.e. commercializing the biodiversity data they obtain. One example given later on relates to how ""all collected data can be used to create AI training sets aimed at identifying and resolving threats to biodiversity."" That example claims that the data could be used to train an AI that deploys ""swarm intelligence drones that are in contact with sensor on the ground"" to ""manage threats and shocks to biodiversity.""

The paper fails to establish how these ""innovations"" will actually promote and protect biodiversity. The paper merely says in its conclusion that ""the results of leveraging [biodiversity] data will hopefully help in biodiversity preservation via sustainable digital technology investments"" (emphasis added). It seems likely that these technology investments allude to the expansion of the sensor network and the Internet of Forests, which appears to be much more about surveilling the natural world and turning it into a financial asset than actually promoting biodiversity, as well as the the aforementioned use of ""swarm intelligence drones"" to ""manage"" biodiversity.

Notably, Mysten Labs, which co-authored the paper with O.N.E. Amazon's co-founders, is deeply tied to the Peter Thiel and DARPA-linked social media network Facebook and its efforts to make its own digital currency. Mysten Labs was founded in September 2021 by four former members of Meta/Facebook's stablecoin project Libra, also known as Diem and Novi Financial. Evan Cheng, co-founder and CEO was previously the head of Research and Development at Novi Financial, while Sam Blackshear, another co-founder and the CTO of Mysten Labs, was previously the Chief Engineer at Novi, having contributed significantly to the creation of the MOVE programming language used by Libra/Diem while at Meta. The founding team also includes Adeniyi Abiodun and George Danezis, key contributors to Diem's stablecoin and the aforementioned MOVE programming language -- the language now employed by Mysten Lab's blockchain, Sui.

O.N.E. Amazon's Partners

Though past efforts of O.N.E. Amazon have involved collaborations with groups like the aforementioned Mysten Labs, the only ""official"" partners it lists on its website include MIT Media Lab, Satellogic, Aecom and Veea. The latter three have significant connections to the U.S. government, namely the U.S. military and intelligence community.

MIT Media Lab was previously the force behind the creation of the Digital Currency Initiative, which partnered with the U.S. Federal Reserve on assessing the feasibility of a U.S. dollar CBDC (that effort is known as Project Hamilton). It is also known for its prior yet very deep financial relationship with sex trafficker of minors, currency speculator and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein, who not only funded MIT Media Lab and cultivated a close relationship with its former head Joi Ito, but also brought in other major donors like Bill Gates and Leon Black. Epstein was extremely interested in cryptocurrency and previously invited crypto pioneer Brock Pierce to his island to speak on cryptocurrency. Pierce would later create the dollar stablecoin Tether (USDT) along with William Quigley, a long-time business partner of Bill Elkus, a former trustee of the J. Epstein Foundation and founding partner of Idealab, the first institutional investor in PayPal. MIT Media Lab appears to not have publicly commented on its partnership with O.N.E. Amazon.

The other partner of O.N.E. Amazon in its IoF project is Satellogic. Satellogic was recently the recipient of $30 million investment from Tether (USDT) and Howard Lutnick, the long-time CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald - the custodian of much of Tether's U.S. Treasuries, sits on the board. Lutnick and Cantor both hold 23.9% each of Satellogic shares, for a combined 47.8%. Lutnick was recently named co-chair of Donald Trump's transition team, where he will help Trump choose cabinet and other executive appointments if Trump's 2024 election bid is successful. Satellogic's board is also chaired by Steve Mnuchin, Trump's former Treasury Secretary who helped implement BlackRock's ""Going Direct"" plan months before and throughout the Covid-19 crisis. ""Going Direct"" put the bulk of money printed for economic relief intended to mitigate the effects of lockdown policies on regular Americans into the hands of Wall Street giants like BlackRock. BlackRock, whose head Larry Fink was tapped by Trump to develop the government's fiscal response to the crisis, used much of that money to buy shares in their own ETFs. The former Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. military under Trump, Joseph Dunford, is also on the board of Satellogic.

Aside from its board, Satellogic's co-founders, Emiliano Kargieman and Gerardo Richarte, were long-time contractors for DARPA, the NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies prior to founding Satellogic. Kargieman recently stated that the company's investment from Tether would help Satellogic advance more easily into the U.S. ""National Security market,"" i.e. intelligence contracts. Tether itself onboarded the FBI, the U.S.' domestic intelligence agency, and Secret Service onto its platform last year, allowing them to surveil and seize Tether from wallets deemed unfriendly by the U.S. government.

In addition, Satellogic, as we reported in Debt From Above, was also a key partner in an effort called GREEN+, which seeks to use satellite surveillance to turn Latin America's protected areas into tokenized carbon credits to be traded on the Bitcoin side-chain Rootstock (RSK) and to finance industrial projects that would construct an inter-continental ""smart grid"" digitally linking the Americas.

Debt From Above: The Carbon Credit Coup Latin America is quietly being forced into a carbon market scheme through regional contractual obligations - enforced by the satellites of a US intelligence-linked firm - which seeks to create an inter-continental ""smart grid,"" erode national and local sovereignty, and link carbon-based life to the debt-based monetary system via a Bitcoin sidechain.

Satellogic isn't the only concerning firm partnered with O.N.E. Amazon. Another partner, Aecom, is the successor to the CIA-linked Ashland Oil and currently contracts extensively with USAID, widely believed to be a CIA front organization. In the 1970s, Ashland Oil pled guilty to multiple counts of making illegal domestic campaign contributions, which later became part of the Watergate scandal, and of bribing government officials in several countries. During this same period, Ashland was revealed to be a recipient of large amounts of CIA funds for ""undisclosed purposes,"" roughly half of which were paid in cash. Ashland, the CIA and the SEC all refused to comment on the nature of these payments. The Washington Post also reported in the late 1970s that the CIA had used Ashland Oil as ""a cover for an agent operating abroad."" In addition, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ashland Oil played a central role in a number of scandals that involved CIA veterans operating in Oman and Libya. Those veterans worked on behalf of what was known as the ""private CIA"" created during the Carter administration by Ted Shackley, the CIA's ""blonde ghost,"" and former CIA covert operations officer Thomas Clines. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, the ""private CIA"" cabal initiated what would become known as the Iran-Contra scandal and its members, including Clines, would become its main conspirators. The same group would later help give rise to Jeffrey Epstein and the networks that enabled his sexual and financial misdeeds.

The subsidiary of Ashland that would become Aecom, Ashland Technology, was formed in 1985, when Ashland was still steeped in clandestine intelligence ties. It was formally spun off in 1990, forming Aecom. Aecom, which now describes itself as an infrastructure firm serving governments, businesses and organizations, acquired long-time USAID, World Bank and Ford Foundation contractor PADCO (Planning and Development Collaborative International). It subsequently acquired a PADCO competitor, The Services Group, and launched Aecom International Development, making the company a major contractor to USAID. The Ford Foundation has long-standing connections to the CIA and USAID itself is widely believed to itself be a CIA front (see here, here, here and here). One of Aecom's partners on USAID contracts, the Nature Conservancy, is deeply connected to the efforts to financialize nature and use ""debt-for-nature"" or ""debt-for-climate"" swaps to force national governments in the Global South to implement certain policies favored by Nature Conservancy stakeholders, such as J.P. Morgan. Notably, a document provided by O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea to the SEC, claims that USAID is directly involved in O.N.E. Amazon's efforts along with unspecified ""UN agencies.""

Veea is a major developer of ""smart city"" technology that is pioneering the creep of those technologies into rural areas and farms. They are also a major provider of 5G technology. They have a deep relationship with U.S. military contractor Qualcomm, which describes itself as ""the driving force behind the development, launch and expansion of 5G."" Veea is one of Qualcomm's main partners in that endeavor. For instance, Veea is part of Qualcomm's Rural Cloud Initiative, which seeks to use 5G connectivity to ""digitally transform"" rural areas and agriculture through developing its AI-powered ""FarmGrid solution."" Veea is also part of Qualcomm's Smart Cities Accelerator Program. Veea is also a major provider of technology aimed at deploying the ""metaverse"" and augmented reality wearables. For example, last year, they announced a merger with augmented reality hardware producer Ostendo Technologies. As will be noted later, Peter Knez's venture before O.N.E. Amazon, the Venom Foundation, was also pushing into the metaverse. Ostendo is backed by the U.S. military's DARPA and Peter Thiel, who co-founded the deeply CIA-linked data-mining firm Palantir. Thiel is intimately connected to Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance and previously played a significant role in Trump's transition team during his first term in addition to being a major donor to Trump in the 2016 election. Ostendo has also worked as a contractor for the U.S. intelligence community's DARPA-equivalent IARPA.

Veea provides the hardware that links together the Internet of Forests (IoF) sensors, which were developed by MIT media Lab and ""others."" It states that building the IoF will occur in 5 phases, beginning with data infrastructure, followed by satellite and drone-provided imagery. The subsequent phases involve ""environmental sensing,"" ""socio-environmental sensing"" which appears to refer to surveilling the activities of locals living in the surveilled areas, and finally ""bio-sensing"" that will provide ""molecule-level insights.""

Veea frames the IoF project as ultimately leading toward an ""AI-driven neural network for our planet."" The effort to develop that neural network, framed as being founded on the ""principle that all species and ecosystems on this planet are part of a single system,"" are already underway. Called ""Enterprise Neurosystem,"" the goal is to ""link all the relevant climate networks and data sources"" for ""climate projects"" around the world into ""a single open AI framework"" and ""conduct a higher order analysis across all points of reference in real time."" This ""AI neurosystem"" would span the entire planet and its partners include not only Veea, but Microsoft, Google, Meta/Facebook, IBM, Intel and Yahoo!, among others. In other words, the IoF of O.N.E. Amazon is intended to eventually span every forest, everywhere, with major implications for nature and society.

O.N.E. Amazon's Dubious Track Record and Future Plans

In September 2022, O.N.E. Amazon signed an agreement with the indigenous organization FICSH, which represents the Shuar people of the Ecuadorian Amazon. FICSH, after reading the agreement more carefully, voted to cancel the agreement with O.N.E. Amazon just a few months later in early February 2023. Regional activist groups like Acción Ecológica have noted that the contract signed dramatically favored the interests of O.N.E. Amazon and put the Shuar at a major disadvantage.

For example, the surveillance systems placed in the forest as part of the agreement, i.e. systems like the Internet of Forests, would be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, and the company could use any type of surveillance device in Shuar territory and pass that data along to anyone they choose without oversight. In addition, any development or conservation project in Shuar territory related to the agreement are to also be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon and the company also possesses final authority over what private businesses or NGOs can enter Shuar territory to execute those projects.

The Shuar are also expected to help facilitate the surveillance of its territories by both the sensor network and by satellite, i.e. Satellogic, and those that ultimately purchase the O.N.E. Amazon digital asset security are also enabled to ""observe"" the Shuar's land via satellite per the contract. The proceeds from the sale from the security derived from Shuar land are also to be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, with the Shuar only entitled to 15% of the profits that O.N.E. Amazon and its OAIF custody. The contract says the Shuar would receive half of their money within 30 days after the sale concludes and the remaining half would be disbursed annually over the remaining 30 year duration of the contract.

In addition, only O.N.E. Amazon can unilaterally cancel the agreement, meaning that the Shuar's rapid change of opinion in the contractual agreement could see them still wait decades before they are actually free of its terms. It also opens up the possibility that O.N.E. Amazon could cancel the contracts after selling its securities but before the 30 days they have to pay the Shuar their half of their meager share of the sales. Ultimately, as REDD-Monitor's Chris Lang noted, O.N.E. Amazon's contract with the Shuar ""would result in a panopticon-level of surveillance over"" their territory, give O.N.E. Amazon control over the monetization of that data, allow O.N.E. Amazon to choose what businesses can enter into and act upon Shuar territory without Shuar consent, and allow O.N.E. Amazon to make almost all of the money. O.N.E. Amazon seems to have secured the signing of this deeply inequitable contract by paying Shuar leadership $10,000 followed by $90,000 once the contract was signed. Yet, given what the Shuar have lost and stand to lose - and what O.N.E. Amazon stands to gain - $100,00 is next to nothing.

In addition to their past contracts with the Shuar, there is also the partnership between the Colombian government and O.N.E. Amazon to consider. O.N.E. Amazon, which no longer publicly discusses its past controversy with the Shuar, instead highlights their partnership with the government of Colombia and how the OAIF will be investing in ""energy transition and circular economy projects"" which will ostensibly benefit both the local environment and local inhabitants.

For instance, the proposed OAIF-funded project in Ciénaga involves a ""clean energy"" port and industrial park as well as two offshore wind projects to be placed off the coast of the Ciénaga port. The offshore wind projects will be entirely owned by BlueFloat, a Spanish offshore wind company. BlueFloat is a portfolio company of 547 energy, which itself is part of the Houston-based Quantum Energy Partners (now Quantum Capital). Quantum, traditionally focused on the oil and gas sector, has - since 2021 - been investing very heavily in carbon capture and carbon market infrastructure companies and it was reported in June 2024 that Quantum has been attempting to sell its stake in BlueFloat for €500 million.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, the Environmental Impact Assessments for the offshore wind projects will be performed by USAID contractor and O.N.E. Amazon partner Aecom. The bulk of the power generated by this plant will not go toward powering local communities but instead will mainly power the Ciénaga industrial park including the Ciénaga desalination and ""green"" hydrogen production plant as well as the proposed Ciénaga ""green"" mineral processing zone, which will process raw minerals from Chile and Argentina (likely lithium) and other South American countries. The area of Ciénaga, per O.N.E. Amazon, has 2000 hectares of industrial ""development potential.""

The master plan for the OAIF-funded project(s) in Ciéwnaga

In addition, as noted by O.N.E. Amazon, the ""stakeholders"" they have engaged with respect to the offshore wind project does not include local inhabitants, indigenous groups or environmental activists. Instead, it includes ""authorities in key [Colombian government] institutions involved in the project"" as well as the British and Spanish embassies, which O.N.E. Amazon says are ""closely collaborat[ing]"" on the projects. It also states that there have been ""discussions"" with the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank, defined by the U.S. military as ""financial weapons"" of U.S. government power, about ""potential support schemes"" for the projects.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, locals who will benefit from these projects will merely be those employed as ""workers, maintenance personnel and [other employed] possibly in related activities such as transportation and logistics."" The proposed projects at Ciénaga will ""benefit"" indigenous tribes by ""conserving"" the ""black line"" (línea negra) that separates indigenous territory from non-indigenous territory.

In addition to Ciénaga, O.N.E. Amazon is backing the production of biocrude from agricultural biomass. The end result of the biocrude produced will be for the aviation industry, as it is intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The plants will be run and operated (and presumably owned) by two foreign companies - the Dutch company BTG Bioliquids and Alder Fuels (now Alder Renewables). BTG and Alder are partners.

Alder was founded by Bryan Sherbacrow, who embezzled $5.9 million from Alder and was sentenced to 3 years in prison this past June. In January 2023, shortly before Sherbacrow was removed from his role as CEO, Alder received millions from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop its SAF production process, which has also been tested at the DoE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ""with support from the U.S. Defense and Logistics Agency,"" part of the U.S. military. Alder is also seeking to use ""blockchain technology tools to account for all the emissions claims from the use of the SAF"" in order to ""generate the necessary records and transparency for compliance with regulatory frameworks, ESG standards and other sustainability commitments."" This will directly enable the functionality of carbon markets as it relates to air travel.

In summary, the O.N.E. Amazon's OAIF-funded projects in Colombia profiled above are industrial projects that will greatly benefit foreign companies and are being closely developed with foreign governments (like the UK and Spain) as well as entities that are funded by or are contractors for the U.S. government. Their ""environmental"" benefits are dubious and, while it would create industrial hubs that could theoretically generate economic growth for the population, the bulk of the infrastructure will be owned by foreign companies, which also receive the vast majority of the profits that result from these projects.

Starlight Ventures and Jalak Jobanputra

O.N.E. Amazons's sole known funder is Starlight Ventures, which funds companies that produce ""transformative technologies to fix the world."" Its other investments focus mainly on biotechnology, lab-grown meat, carbon market infrastructure, autonomous mining vehicles and space-related technologies, especially satellite surveillance firms. The firm was co-founded by Patricia Wexler, a Venezuelan-American businesswoman who previously worked with top Disney executives and then Elevation Partners, a significant investor in Facebook, Uber and other prominent tech companies.

Starlight Ventures also has ties to the Endeavor Network, which is deeply embedded in Latin America - particularly its cryptocurrency infrastructure - and is heavily funded by the controversial Bronfman family and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay and owner of PayPal from 2002 to 2015. For instance, one of its three venture partners is Santiago Bilinkis, one of the earliest fixtures in the Endeavor Network who - among other things - first connected Wences Casares, the founder of Xapo Bank, with Endeavor's Linda Rottenberg. Bilinkis later co-founded Wanako Games with Casares and has served on Endeavor's board of directors. Bilinkis is still involved with Endeavor's Argentina branch, serving on its Council of Founders alongside Argentine oligarchs like Eduardo Elzstain, host of the Bilderberg-style Llao Llao Forum in Bariloche, Argentina. Starlight also invests in some Endeavor-backed companies, like Satellogic, which is also considerably connected to Endeavor's Argentina branch.

The Chain of Custody: The ""Mafia"" Holding The Elite's Bitcoin The companies poised to dominate the digital financial infrastructure of Latin America have arisen courtesy of the self-described ""mafia"" multiplier, Endeavor. Flush with funds from billionaires linked to the US intelligence and organized crime, Endeavor's influence over the CEOs it has championed promises that, with the ushering in of a new financial system, a wave of covert dollarization will shortly follow.

According to an older profile written by Starlight Ventures about O.N.E. Amazon and cited by Acción Ecologica, an investor named Jalak Jobanputra is named the third co-founder of O.N.E. Amazon. Jobanputra, before founding her VC firm Future Perfect Ventures, was the director of Emerging Market Mobile Investments for Pierre Omidyar's the Omidyar Network and also previously worked for Intel and Lehman Brothers. While at the Omidyar Network, Jobanputra closed ""Omidyar's largest for profit investment ($5M) to date in Latin America, a wireless company that created credit profiles on unbanked middle income consumers using mobile data.""

It was reportedly during her time at the Omidyar Network that Jobanputra became interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrency. More specifically, it was her ""time spent in Africa analyzing the growth of the mobile money services platform M-Pesa,"" which led her to believe that crypto and bitcoin adoption were more likely to succeed in emerging markets. However, Jobanputra links adoption of these technologies to having a digital ID ""that you [can] have different assets associated with and can transact with."" Notably, the Omidyar Network is a long-time funder of technologies that enable CBDC issuance as well as Digital ID. In addition, through Endeavor, the Omidyar Network backs the biggest companies in Latin America's fintech space, effectively dominating the payment rails for crypto and bitcoin and therefore centralizing control over them and neutering the supposed ""decentralizing"" effects of cryptocurrency and bitcoin adoption.

In Jobanputra's case, her current VC firm has invested in a variety of crypto companies including BitGo, Blockstream and Celo. BitGo was founded by Mike Belshe, a big supporter of Trump VP pick JD Vance, alongside Ben Davenport and has previously custodied the U.S. government's bitcoin. Blockstream is fundamentally connected to Bitcoin Core and, thus, has played an outsized role in most of the past major updates made on the Bitcoin network, making them so important to that network that Endeavor's Reid Hoffman once suggested they would be the Microsoft or Google of blockchain (Hoffman is a key member of the Endeavor network and ""PayPal Mafia,"" and was previously a Blockstream board member and is also a major Blockstream investor). Celo is a ""mobile first,"" ""carbon neutral"" blockchain with a major focus on ""scaling voluntary carbon markets"" and stablecoins. Its investors include Reid Hoffman, Jack Dorsey and Coinbase Ventures. Celo has a particularly important relationship with Circle's dollar stablecoin USDC, which Coinbase's Brian Armstrong once suggested would become the U.S.' de facto CBDC. Circle and USDC are deeply connected to BlackRock, with BlackRock holding a minority stake in Circle, Circle's USDC being used to convert shares of BlackRock's first tokenized fund BUIDL into digital dollars, and the Circle Reserve Fund being managed by BlackRock.

Peter Knez and the Venom Foundation

O.N.E. Amazon co-founder Peter Knez began his career at Goldman Sachs as a Quantitive Research Associate, before joining Barclays' BGI as their Chief Investment Officer. While employed at Barclays, Knez personally oversaw the creation of their iShares brand, an essential pillar in the proliferation of the now-dominant ETF market. In a conversation with Nasdaq, Knez claimed that ""ETFs really only started with iShares at BGI."" According to Knez, ""there was a simple reason for developing it: we were the largest institutional asset manager without a mutual fund product and wanted to expand into retail."" The iShares ETFs ""allowed us to enter the retail market and compete with Mutual Funds"" by ""replicating existing indexes with a product that traded on exchanges, while disclosing their holding on a daily basis and delivering liquidity and transparency in a tax efficient format.""

Due to global collateral damage during the 2008 financial crisis, BGI was eventually acquired by BlackRock in 2009, who took the iShares brand to new heights, including the fastest growing ETF in history, the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF. When asked about BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, Knez implied ""we are in the early innings of the 'institutional' regime in cryptocurrencies and blockchain as the Wild West regime ends,"" and later described this institutional regime as ""characterized by increased participation of institutions like BlackRock and by governments"" while noting incoming ""legislation providing a regulatory framework for digital assets"" within the United States. Knez further claims that ""BlackRock wants to participate in this regulatory momentum"" and stated his believe that ""BlackRock will ultimately succeed"" due to their ""excellent track record"" while articulating suspicions that CEO Larry Fink ""would not have gone public if it was not pre-approved.""

Knez, however, has stated that Bitcoin as a speculative asset is less important than the underlying blockchain technology:

""My view is Bitcoin is to blockchain much like search or pornography was to the internet. It drove early adoption, but the underlying technology is much more important. Technologies that remove important frictions and improve benefit for society, those are the ones that persist. Blockchain, in my view, is such a technology, and the institutions believe it, too. I've talked to BlackRock, I had lunch today with very senior people at Morgan Stanley, they believe it too. And they're preparing for it. They're preparing for it because they know it's a quantum leap and they know they have to be in this game they cannot stand on the sidelines.""

In a conversation with CertiK, Knez noted that this imminent transformation was why he ""couldn't resist getting involved."" He later made reference to his former Goldman Sachs boss, Fischer Black, best known as one of the authors of the Black-Scholes equation, who ""started option pricing"" and ""created the whole notion of synthetic replication."" According to Knez, ""tokenization of real world assets is as big, or bigger than that"" and will ""dramatically change the way assets are managed"":

""Once you tokenize it, you can trade it. Once you can trade, it you can index it. Once you index, it you can write synthetics on it. That's transformative in a way that's never been transformed ever...The reason you see guys like Larry Fink pushing tokenization now is, for one, that Aladdin's about to have the functionality he wants for his clients. [And] number two, there's not a lot of alternatives to go scale the business. This is a way for the large institutions, whether it's Morgan Stanley or BlackRock or the other asset managers, this is a way for them to scale their business. And so that's why I think it's inevitable.""

In line with these beliefs, Knez participated in the launch of a new layer one blockchain, Venom, and alongside it founded the Venom Foundation in 2020. Other Venom Foundation members include Mustafa Kheriba, the Executive Chairman of Iceberg Capital; Dr. Kai-Uwe Steck, manager of Pontinova Circle Investment Group; Osman Sultan, the former CEO of DU Telecom and Founder of Fikratech; and Shahal M. Khan, Founder of Burkhan World, Trinity Hospitality Holdings and the CEO of Burtech. In August 2023, the Venom Foundation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United Arab Emirates Government to ""develop and implement the National Carbon Credit System"" in preparation of the country hosting COP28 that November. ""Venom Foundation has provided an unparalleled solution, acting as a key infrastructure for a global ecosystem for Web3 applications, with superfast transaction speeds and unlimited scalability to meet governments' needs."" Knez explained that the foundation is ""the first company in the UAE to develop and licence its blockchain technology and shape the future of national decentralised systems and digitise operations in corporate and government enterprises."" The MOU further covers ""green investment,"" ""adaptation to climate change,"" ""reducing carbon emissions,"" ""preparing and implementing a climate neutrality strategy,"" while ""enhancing partnership opportunities with the private sector.""

Knez expressed his excitement upon the signing of the MOU, commenting that the foundation is ""honored and excited to join hands with the UAE Government to build the National Carbon Credit System."" The press release claims that this was ""a revolutionary collaboration"" which demonstrates ""the UAE's unwavering commitment to bolstering transparency, reliability, and efficiency in carbon emission management"" via ""the next generation blockchain technology of Venom"" which boasts being ""carbon neutral."" Knez, the chair of the foundation, had previously told Nasdaqthat Venom was ""focused on three primary projects: stablecoins, carbon credits, and commodities"" and furthered that ""with respect to stablecoins"" the foundation was ""involved with governments and commercial banks in countries both in Africa and Asia."" Knez believes the ""combination of blockchain and smart contracts"" will ""profoundly transform financial services"" in the ensuing decade. ""They will be unrecognizable, as almost every core function in financial services will be transformed.""

In order to advance this transformation, the Venom Foundation partnered with Iceberg Capital, led by Venom foundation member Mustafa Kheriba, in January 2023 to form the Venom Ventures Fund (VVF). The goal of the VVF was to create ""a ten-figure war chest"" with $1 billion dedicated to ""accelerating the adoption of blockchain, DeFi, and web3 in MENA and beyond."" Knez was chosen to chair the venture, while readying ""strategic investments"" to ""transform digital asset management"" via the ""ideal platform for us to achieve this goal,"" the Venom blockchain. Interestingly, both the Venom Foundation and Iceberg Capital currently operate within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a ""fast-growing financial center situated in the heart of the UAE's capital."" It was founded a decade ago to ""promote entrepreneurship throughout the United Arab Emirates and the wider MENA region."" Venom had previously been granted ""a formal license to issue utility tokens by ADGM"" and according to Forbes, became ""the first blockchain to come under government agency control"" and to be ""monitored by a regulatory body.""

According to reporting from The Block, at the time of its announcement, the fund said it had led a $20 million investment in Nümi Metaverse and the next January announced a $5 million investment in Layer 1 blockchain Everscale, while ""no deals have been announced since."" In a December 2023 tweet, the Venom Foundation announced they will ""no longer continue operating in ADGM and in accordance with section 40 of the regulations, the Foundation has initiated the dissolution process.""

While there is little to show for the $1 billion fund launched in 2023, just last week, Venom announced a ""historic agreement with the government of the Republic of the Philippines"" in order to ""digitize billions of accountable forms using its advanced blockchain technology"" in ""what could end up as the world's largest blockchain use case,"" according to reporting from Gulf News.

Christopher Louis Tsu, the CEO of Venom Foundation, called Venom's selection by the Republic of the Philippines a ""testament to our platform's capabilities and the trust placed in our technology."" He furthered noted that ""by digitizing checks using Venom blockchain, we are not only reducing printing and processing costs but also significantly enhancing transparency and efficiency in financial operations"" demonstrating ""the massive utilization of the Venom blockchain in the form of hundreds of millions of Venom tokens annually"" while showcasing their ""commitment to delivering scalable, secure, and innovative solutions for national-level applications.""

These aspirations for further institutional and nation-state adoption of blockchain was seemingly echoed by Knez in a discussion with CoinTelegraph in March 2023:

""It is the early innings of the institutionalization of Web3. It's early innings, but it's going to happen... If you want to attract institutional money, you're going to have to seek regulation... The era of the Wild West is ending, which I think is good for everybody. So I advise them to to embrace the institutionalization, as that's what time it is.""

Now, with O.N.E. Amazon, it appears clear that Knez is seeking to again partner with major governments to tokenize real world assets, in this case the natural world, and to enable the advancement of a global carbon market/carbon offset economy.

Rodrigo Veloso's ""O.N.E"" Empire

The other co-founder and current CEO of O.N.E. Amazon is Rodrigo Veloso, a Brazilian entrepreneur who developed the O.N.E. Coconut Water brand, later sold to PepsiCo in 2012. That same year he co-founded Brazil's first online insurance company, Segurar.com, though it appears not to have launched until 2013. Around this time, in 2013, Veloso began working at Unik Capital, which operates in both the U.S. and Brazil, and he claims to still work there even though he is not mentioned on the company website. He has also claimed to be the founder of Unik Capital and that he used his funds from selling O.N.E. Coconut Water to Pepsi to do so. However, only CEO Sylvie Proia is listed as the founder on the company's website.

A year after joining Unik Capital, in 2014, Veloso attempted to acquire a decommissioned naval base in Puerto Rico and turn it into a ""mix of Disney World and Las Vegas,"" a ""green city with a focus on entertainment,"" marking his first foray into ""green"" business ventures that would later culminate with his role in co-creating O.N.E. Amazon. In addition to O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso also created another company called O.N.E. Natural Energy that specializes in producing syngas, which can be produced from ""a wide range of carbon-containing substances"" and is used to generate electricity or ""as a building block for a range of desirable commodities, from methanol to gasoline."" O.N.E. Natural Energy currently operates in Brazil.

A few years before creating O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso played an interesting role in the efforts to take Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of the Trump-centric social network Truth Social, public. Beginning in 2021, TMTG planned to merge with Digital World, a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC. The merger ultimately occurred in March of this year. The merger was controversial and fraught with scandals for Digital World. As a consequence of the insider trading allegations and fines from the SEC, former CEO of Digital World Patrick Orlando was fired from that role in March 2023 due to the scandals, though Orlando has sued the new CEO, Eric Swider, alleging Swider had planned a ""coup d'etat"" of Digital World to depose him.

Rodrigo Veloso is a close friend of Orlando's and was a Digital World board member from July 2021 until December 2022. Veloso was also present on a pre-merger call with Trump, while still a board member at Digital World, which later became a key focus of the SEC investigation into Digital World that ended with the SEC suing Orlando (the suit was filed after Orlando was fired from Digital World). The New York Times reported that Veloso was acting as an adviser to Orlando on the call. In addition to the SEC charges against Orlando, Digital World was fined $18 million by the SEC. There have been no allegations of TMTG itself engaging in improper trades or other activities related to charges against Digital World and its past executives. Ultimately, the SPAC merger between TMTG and Digital World added billions to Trump's net worth and allegedly provided a ""financial lifeline"" to the former president. Veloso, in addition to his ties to Orlando and Digital World, was also a board member/director of TMTG itself from September 2021 until December 2022, the same time he resigned from Digital World when the then-Orlando-led company was the subject of several investigations. Notably, during this same period of time (2021-2022), Veloso was laying the groundwork for the formal launch of O.N.E. Amazon, including efforts to trademark the Internet of Forests concept and signing the controversial agreement between O.N.E. Amazon and the Shuar in 2022.

Carbon Sink or Debt Sink?

In examining the efforts of O.N.E. Amazon and their recently announced partnership with Satellogic, it is worth dwelling on why a company like Satellogic, which is deeply tied to the stablecoin Tether and the U.S. Treasuries market through its board member Howard Lutnick, might wish to be involved with such an endeavor.

Much like a corporation, the United States government itself has a budget it must finance, partly through taxation of citizens and companies, but mostly via the issuance of new debt sold in the form of government bonds known as Treasuries. These securities are directly issued by the U.S. Treasury with the yield, or rate of the return, effectively set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and its governors via the Federal Funding Rate, commonly referred to as an interest rate. Typically, these bonds yield a higher rate of return the longer the duration for which they are issued. For example, a 30 year Treasury would yield a higher coupon than a 3 month Treasury to incentivize buyers to hold U.S. debt for greater periods of time, giving the government a longer runway to service their debt obligations. On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Committee cut the targeted federal funding rate to 0% due to ""the effects of the coronavirus"" weighing ""on economic activity in the near term"" and thus ""risks to the economic outlook.""

""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the Fed statement said. ""Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected."" Despite the ensuing lockdowns and widespread fear of the virus, President Trump praised the Fed that week, saying in a briefing at the White House that the rate cut ""makes me very happy."" In retrospect, the combination of government-mandated lockdowns and the Fed's aggressive rate cut, with unprecedented financial stimulus being distributed (with heavy profits) with collaboration from private sector stalwarts like BlackRock, systemically changed the financial system not just for the U.S., but the world at large. In fact, the Fed ""struck a deal"" with five other central banks including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, to ""lower their rates"" to ""keep the financial markets functioning normally.""

By printing trillions of dollars of newly issued debt at effectively 0% interest rates while simultaneously shuttering monetary velocity and demand alongside the businesses forced to close by their reactionary legislation, Trump's Treasury, led by current Satellogic board Chair Steve Mnuchin, massively increased the monetary supply and the U.S. government's debt obligations while minimizing the immediate inflationary effects of such stimulus. This unprecedented combination of Fed, Treasury and domestic policies allowed huge profits for the highest wealth bands in the nation, with those closest to the money spigot able to gobble up commodities with freshly printed dollars. Arguably, no company benefited more than BlackRock, having been a chief architect of the ""Going Direct"" plan, which allowed them to use these supposed pandemic relief funds to purchase large swaths of assets including from their own iShares ETF division, having acquired the Knez-led iShares from Barclay's during the 2008 crisis after the bank denied a government bail out of their own.

The same March 2020 week as the rate cuts, Bitcoin crashed to nearly $3000, oil futures went negative, and real estate and stock markets around the world collapsed, offering an unprecedented buying opportunity to those with the capital to take advantage -- namely the recently ""stimulated"" BlackRock. But the U.S. government still needed a buyer of Treasuries and while finding a new place to sink this freshly issued debt, the Fed itself began ""purchasing massive amounts of debt securities,"" a technique utilized during the 2008 crisis known as Quantitive Easing, or QE. As Brookings notes, the Fed aimed to ""restore smooth functioning"" to the ""Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets"" which ""play a critical role in the flow of credit to the broader economy.""

On March 15, 2020, the Fed ""shifted the objective"" of QE to supporting the economy, agreeing to purchase ""at least $500 billion in Treasury securities"" and ""$200 billion in government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities"" over ""the coming months."" A week later, on March 23, 2020, the Fed agreed to make the purchases open-ended, saying it would acquire securities ""in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" and thus ""expanding the stated purpose of the bond buying to include bolstering the economy."" By June 2020, the Fed lowered the rate of purchases to ""at least $80 billion a month in Treasuries"" and ""$40 billion in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities"" for the time being. The Fed again updated its policy in December 2020 to slow these purchases when the economy made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and in November 2021, the Fed began tapering the pace of securities purchases.

By October 2021, Bitcoin had rocketed to nearly $70,000, and alongside it arose a new insatiable buyer of U.S. debt via government-issued securities -- dollar stablecoin issuers, led by Tether and Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald. As previously reported by Unlimited Hangout:

""In the past 18 months, a new high volume net buyer of this debt has appeared in the cryptocurrency industry: stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether or Circle have purchased over $150 billion of U.S. debt -- in the form of securities issued by the Treasury -- in order to ""back"" the issuance of their dollar-pegged tokens with a dollar-denominated asset. For some perspective on the absolutely astounding amount of volume these relatively young and relatively small businesses have gobbled up of U.S. debt, China and Japan, historically the U.S.' largest creditors, hold just under and just over $1 trillion, respectively, in these same debt instruments. Despite only existing for a decade, and despite only surpassing a $10 billion market cap in 2020, this leaves Tether alone at over 10% the Treasuries held by either of the U.S.' largest nation-state creditors.""

While the likes of Tether's USDT, alongside BlackRock-affiliated Circle's USDC and PayPal's PYUSD issued by Paxos, the U.S. has found partners for servicing the $35 trillion of already-issued debt alongside any future government budget as well as the modern evolution of the public-private partnership of capital creation while sustaining dollar hegemony across the globe via surveillable, programmable and seizable private bank currencies. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino previously claimed that Tether froze around $435 million in USDT for the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service on its path to becoming a ""world class partner"" to the U.S. to ""expand dollar hegemony globally.""

Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald, which holds Tether's T-Bills, is ""among the best-known bond trading houses on Wall Street"" and ""one of 25 primary dealers for U.S. Treasuries"" which allows ""direct trade with the Federal Reserve."" A report from September 2023 stated that Tether held $86.4 billion of assets in reserves with a later attestation report showing that USDT is mostly backed by U.S. Treasuries. By July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 5.5%, the ""highest level in 22 years,"" in hopes of making ""borrowing and investing more expensive."" With rates having risen faster than ever in U.S. history from the 0% target reached in March 2020, firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald -- net buyers of short duration securities known as T-Bills - are set to receive high yields with very little risk. In Tether's Q1 2023 Assurance Report, the stablecoin issuer held $81.8 billion with ""the majority of its reserves"" having been ""invested in U.S. Treasury Bills"" with ""all new issuance of tokens"" having ""been invested in U.S. Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo.""

In this same report, the company announced they would ""regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin (BTC)"" via ""utilizing realized profits from its investment strategy,"" which relied predominantly on short duration Treasuries. In Q1 2023, Tether held approximately $1.5 billion in bitcoin. By April 2024, the firm held approximately 75,354 bitcoin, worth nearly $4.5 billion today.

In Ardoino's statement regarding ""the decision to invest in Bitcoin"", the current CEO of Tether noted ""its limited supply"" as a reason for why the asset has ""emerged as a long-term store of value"" complete with ""substantial growth potential."" Whereas the U.S. government via the Treasury can continually issue these securities with no limit via a capped supply, bitcoin the asset has a predetermined issuance schedule, and an eventual total supply of just under 21 million bitcoin. The scarcity innate to bitcoin allows a debt-based financial system like the U.S. dollar system to continue to inflate into the demand inelastic, deflationary monetary policy of bitcoin. Now that the U.S. en masse has emerged, in no small part thanks to BlackRock's iShares IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF, as the world's largest known holder of bitcoin, complete with regulatory blessing from the likes of the DOJ and SEC, the Treasury has found willing market partners in their quest to service their debts and further dollarize the planet.

But it is perhaps within the planet itself that a new method for retaining U.S. dollar hegemony has emerged - the dollar-denominated, limited supply carbon market proposed by O.N.E. Amazon. Far from an unsubstantiated theory, Knez himself states precisely that the Amazon rainforest ""should be valued in the trillions"" and that his company is ""enabling the market to value it as such"" by ""turning it into an advanced digital asset security."" In a discussion with Gulf News, Knez took this one step further in explaining why the tangible parameters of the Amazon's size led to the creation of a limited supply of securities, providing the necessary mechanism to create a dollar-denominated debt sink out of the rainforest upon the security's appreciation:

""At O.N.E. Amazon, we are harnessing the power of the market - the same force that has driven exploitation - to transform it into a tool for conservation. We aim to prove that the Amazon is more valuable alive than dead.

We're not just environmentalists; we're innovators, economists, technologists, and community leaders. Together, we're developing a digital security asset - that represents the intrinsic value of the world's largest rainforest's biome. This isn't just a financial instrument; it's a statement, a commitment to the belief that the Amazon is valuable and ought to be priced. In terms of financial returns, investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the digital security as the market values the positive environmental and social benefits of the rainforest's biome.

Given the finite size of the Amazon rainforest, the total number of securities will be restricted to 750 million, corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest. This creates a limited supply of digital securities."" [emphasis added]

Due to the limited supply of digital securities, O.N.E. Amazon has created an axiom for vast capital appreciation of the asset itself, allowing a further expansion of dollar-denominated liabilities and thus further eventual demand for the dollar's underlying asset: U.S. Treasuries. Knez implies the Amazon should be valued in the trillions, and, much like he did in his role spearheading the iShares ETF brand, has created yet another growth market for the U.S. capital markets to ""quantitively ease"" into. Interestingly, this type of government debt expansion was theorized by RFK Jr.'s former running mate, Nicole Shanahan, in a project she led at Stanford titled ""An Analysis of Carbon Credit Markets as Validation for Climate Supportive Quantitative Easing Using the Blockchain"" described below:

""This project will provide a white paper for a carbon coin that works in tandem with the existing carbon credit (offset) markets. As an active venture investor in carbon credit markets such as Pachama and Joro Technologies, and a major customer of these offsets with my husband Sergey Brin, I will be leveraging the current entrepreneurial ecosystem to identify the economic, policy, and technological requirements to scale a carbon credit coin...While authors and futurists such as Kim Stanley Robinson (author of Ministry of the Future), have focused on the feasibility of governments issuing carbon coins in exchange for carbon sequestration, my argument is that a private market can first be situated to verify the accuracy of the carbon sequestration projects funded by the coin. The government can in turn, have evidence based results by which to sell government treasuries into the carbon coin network.""

These ""evidence based results"" of which Shanahan theorized, as it relates to the O.N.E. Amazon scheme, would presumably be the data provided by their satellite partner, Satellogic. Due to Satellogic's board being Chaired by former Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Cantor Fitzgerald's Lutnick large stake of shares and board position, and their funding by leading dollar-denominated stablecoin issuer Tether, the personnel and wherewithal to create such a debt sink at a time of dire need has been assembled.

As the U.S.' ballooning debt demands further areas to place their newly-issued debt, Knez and O.N.E. Amazon have all but directly proposed making the 750 million hectares of Amazon rainforest exactly that place.

Datafication & Debt - The New ""Conservation""

O.N.E. Amazon's stated reasons for its business model - ostensibly ""preserving"" and ""conserving"" the Amazon - reflect a broader effort to frame efforts to centralize control over the global commons and build out a surveillance grid for both people and the planet as the only ""feasible"" means of rescuing the planet from catastrophe. However, as this article has endeavored to show, O.N.E. Amazon's interest is not in helping locals or indigenous groups or even in helping actually conserve the rainforest in the way most would imagine. Instead, the goal is to turn the Amazon rainforest into an exploitative farm - a farm for data that itself can be monetized and tokenized, just like the hectarage of the Amazon itself.

As the architects of Wall Street's new web3 economy search for new ways to store the wealth they have pilfered from the public through organized wealth transfers, more forms of ""digital gold"" will become a necessity. While bitcoin represents one digital store of value, the race is on to tokenize real world assets, especially the natural world and natural resources, in order to perpetuate the debt-based monetary system that has enabled the theft of regular people's wealth for centuries. Framed in altruistic terms of ""helping"" the environment and the have-nots, we are instead witnessing the ""datafication"" of all life both for profit and so that all life - including human beings and the natural world - can be surveilled, eventually down to the molecular level, and then ""managed"" by intelligent machines. Such a paradigm does not represent ""conservation"" or ""preservation,"" but rather the onboarding of our greatest natural treasures onto a system of hi-tech control, with every flutter of a butterfly wing and every branch swaying in the breeze being converted into bits and bytes that predatory bankers can trade and speculate on for profit.

O.N.E. Amazon is more than a company, it represents a model that others are following which seeks to borgify the natural world, and us along with it, claiming to ""harness the market"" to save us all from a vague yet impending doom. However, we and the forests are not being saved, we are being put in chains - forced into a prison without walls where the sensors to be placed on and in the trees and on and in our bodies will connect us to the bankers' blockchain of choice and allow us to be traded or sold, our biological signals and processes monetized for their benefit, and the masses of people, plants and animals on this planet to be ""managed"" by AI-powered machines that they program and control.

"""Sustainably"" Surveilling & Tokenizing Nature: The Case of O.N.E. Amazon "" Sons of Liberty Media",https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/sustainably-surveilling-tokenizing-nature-the-case-of-o-n-e-amazon/,2024-08-31,Sons of Liberty Media,"The architect of BlackRock's ETFs has teamed up with a group of companies tied to US intelligence and US government debt trading to tokenize the Amazon rainforest and borgify it with a large-scale sensor network in order to create a new form of ""digital gold.""

A satellite surveillance company with links to U.S. intelligence, former Trump administration officials, U.S. government debt barons and the stablecoin Tether (USDT) announced plans earlier this year to build the ""Internet for Forests"" in the Amazon rainforest. The satellite company, called Satellogic, plans to join an initiative to rig up one of the world's oldest and most important forests with sensors and ""machine intelligence infrastructure"" led by a group called O.N.E. Amazon. O.N.E. Amazon, in turn, seeks to turn the Amazon rainforest into a digital asset security to be chopped up, tokenized and sold off to investors around the world as a novel form of digital credit. O.N.E. Amazon's partners in this endeavor, such as Aecom, also have important U.S. intelligence connections.

O.N.E. Amazon is chaired by Peter Knez, who oversaw the creation of ETFs (exchange traded funds) and iShares, which is now owned by BlackRock. Knez, who also served for many years as BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Officer, also chairs the Venom Foundation, which is developing a proprietary blockchain and token to facilitate the ""development and implementation of central bank digital currency (CBDC) and traditional finance products by governments and businesses"" around the world. Given that O.N.E. Amazon describes its rainforest tokenization initiative as ""crypto with a purpose"" and that it is also chaired by Knez, it seems likely that the Amazon-focused initiative may involve Venom in some capacity. Given Satellogic's ties to past efforts to impose a Bitcoin blockchain-powered carbon market on Latin America, it is also possible that Bitcoin or another prominent blockchain will be used, especially considering the involvement of Jalak Jobanputra, a major investor in the digital currency space and particularly in important Bitcoin-related companies, in allegedly co-founding O.N.E. Amazon.

As we previously reported earlier this year in a piece entitled Tokenized Inc., BlackRock and other titans of finance are attempting to tokenize and financialize the natural world. Considering that the architect of iShares now stands at the helm of O.N.E. Amazon, it is important to reflect on BlackRock's Larry Fink's words shortly after the approval of the iShares Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. Fink stated that ""We believe ETFs are a technology no different than Bitcoin was a technology for asset storage."" In other words, blockchain and ETFs, per Fink, merely serve as a technological means to store centralized indexes, funds and tokenized assets, in direct contrast to the founding aspirations of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. Now, the very man who developed BlackRock's ETF machine is seeking to tokenize the Amazon rainforest and transform it into a digital asset of finite supply - essentially turning a major and crucial ecosystem into a ""digital gold"" or bitcoin analogue.

For years, titans of Wall Street like BlackRock have helped saddle South American countries with unprecedented debt levels, robbing them of their economic sovereignty through dollarization or institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Now, they are seeking to turn the continent's most crucial resources into a form of ""digital gold"" that will be enforced by a satellite-sensor system tied to individuals deeply invested in efforts to globalize dollar-denominated debt and also to American intelligence. While the goal is framed as ""conservation"" of the Amazon, the Satellogic-O.N.E. Amazon proposal seeks instead to enable the exploitation of a protected resource like never before while also building a cybernetic surveillance grid into one of nature's greatest monuments - not to ensure the forest's ""health"" - but to ensure the ""integrity"" of the digital asset security it is now poised to uphold.

O.N.E. Amazon aims to create ""sustainable impact for the environment and investors by using next-generation technology to bring innovation to conservation."" It was formally launched at COP28 in December 2023 but appears to have begun operations sometime around 2021, if not earlier. The ""innovation"" O.N.E. Amazon offers is related to its issuance of an upcoming,""regulated O.N.E. Amazon Digital Asset Security."" Per O.N.E. Amazon's chairman Peter Knez, ""each security will represent the perceived value of one hectare of biome in the Amazon rainforest, backed by a 30-year preservation agreement over that land."" The amount of securities to be issued will be capped at 750 million, ""corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest."" In other words, each security issued represents one hectare of the Amazon. Knez stated in an interview with TradeArabia that the group has already secured ""an impressive long-term land preservation agreement for 50 million hectares of rainforest, an area larger than Spain."" The company asserts that ""investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the security"" in large part due to ""the finite size"" of the rainforest it is tokenizing.

Proceeds from purchases of this security will go to the O.N.E. Amazon Impact Found (OAIF), which is headquartered Abu Dhabi, UAE and ""will create jobs for the local Amazonian communities and accelerate the energy transition of the countries through which the Amazon rainforest extends."" At its COP28 launch, O.N.E. Amazon, along with the OAIF, was described as ""the world's first trillion-dollar nature-based asset platform."" Goldman Sachs is the ""structuring partner"" for the fund. The company has also stated that this fund ""will invest in energy transition and circular economy projects, including infrastructure and clean energy generation projects, in addition to more localised community land preservation projects in the Amazon."" It also purports to ""better the lives"" of the millions who inhabit the region.

However, as we shall soon see, O.N.E. Amazon's efforts to-date in the Amazon show that the group, despite claiming to champion ecosystem preservation and indigenous well-being, have acted predatorily with respect to indigenous Amazonian tribes. They are also backing major industrial projects in the countries it operates that do not benefit the local people or environment, arguably the opposite.

In order to help underwrite their digital asset security linked to each hectare of the Amazon rainforest, O.N.E. Amazon plans to build the ""world's first Internet of Forest (IoF)"" in partnership with MIT Media Lab and the aforementioned satellite surveillance company, Satellogic. A percentage of the OAIF will go toward building out the IoF and other investments in Amazon ""data enablement."" MIT Media Lab is specifically helping O.N.E. Amazon create ""a framework to monitor every hectare that is tokenized against a Digital Asset Security"" that will also ""provide a data-driven, real-time understanding of what's happening the Amazon biome."" On its website, O.N.E. Amazon states that the IoF will ""monitor and analyze the health"" of the rainforest while also ""digitally connect[ing] every hectare of land."" According to O.N.E. Amazon co-founder and CEO Rodrigo Veloso, a former board member of Trump Media & Technology Group:

""The Internet of Forests is intended to ensure reliable measurements of key environmental and social metrics; serve as world - class data collection and storage infrastructure for scientific analysis of forest environments; and enable local communities to better understand how their behavior and the behavior of institutions impact the natural environment within the rainforest.""

Chris Lang, contributing editor of the REDD-Monitor substack, revealed in a 2023 report that O.N.E. Amazon has sought to trademark the ""Internet of Forests"" concept since 2021 and that the trademark is intended to cover the following:

""Software as a service; electronic data storage; database development; data analysis and processing; information / data processing; research on agroforestry and agroecological systems; research activities, including the use of apparatus and instruments for activities related to the operation of monitoring and measuring forestry and lands; scanning; advice and consultancy in carrying out tests and measurements for quality control; measurement and verification of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases; aero photogrammetry; photogrammetry; land surveying; topographic surveys; geological surveys; environmental control of air and noise pollution; research in the field of environmental protection; geological research; biological research; providing scientific information, advice and consultancy relating to carbon offsetting; development of technical projects on agroforestry and agroecological systems.""

Given the mentions of carbon dioxide emissions and carbon offsetting, it seems clear that the O.N.E. Amazon security and the ""Internet of Forests"" underwriting it intends to integrate into the broader efforts to impose carbon markets globally. As noted in previous reporting, Latin America has been a major focus for ""green"" bankers and financiers in this regard and O.N.E. Amazon, like groups like GREEN+, are using deeply inequitable contractual agreements made at the local level to implement their plans. The O.N.E. Amazon contracts will be discussed in later detail shortly.

In addition, in a research paper published earlier this year in April, O.N.E. Amazon co-founders Peter Knez and Rodrigo Veloso joined O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea and Mysten Labs to develop an approach where blockchain technology could be integrated into ""biodiversity conservation, offering a novel perspective on how digital resilience can be built within ecological contexts."" The paper, entitled ""Preserving Nature's Ledger: Blockchains in Biodiversity Conservation,"" promotes a framework that focuses on ""tokenization strategies for biodiversity species and for IoT solutions, such as sensors, drones, and satellites to monitor and record data related to species and ecosystems.""

The paper notes that the biodiversity data obtained under this framework could be used to develop new green bonds and derivatives that could be traded on a blockchain. To accomplish this, they propose the ""datafication of biodiversity,"" which they define as ""the process of creating digital representations of various species in the ecosystem. They also propose ""data repurposing cascades,"" which refers to ""the process of reusing collected biodiversity data for various purposes [...] that are not necessarily and directly connected to conservation efforts,"" i.e. commercializing the biodiversity data they obtain. One example given later on relates to how ""all collected data can be used to create AI training sets aimed at identifying and resolving threats to biodiversity."" That example claims that the data could be used to train an AI that deploys ""swarm intelligence drones that are in contact with sensor on the ground"" to ""manage threats and shocks to biodiversity.""

The paper fails to establish how these ""innovations"" will actually promote and protect biodiversity. The paper merely says in its conclusion that ""the results of leveraging [biodiversity] data will hopefully help in biodiversity preservation via sustainable digital technology investments"" (emphasis added). It seems likely that these technology investments allude to the expansion of the sensor network and the Internet of Forests, which appears to be much more about surveilling the natural world and turning it into a financial asset than actually promoting biodiversity, as well as the the aforementioned use of ""swarm intelligence drones"" to ""manage"" biodiversity.

Notably, Mysten Labs, which co-authored the paper with O.N.E. Amazon's co-founders, is deeply tied to the Peter Thiel and DARPA-linked social media network Facebook and its efforts to make its own digital currency. Mysten Labs was founded in September 2021 by four former members of Meta/Facebook's stablecoin project Libra, also known as Diem and Novi Financial. Evan Cheng, co-founder and CEO was previously the head of Research and Development at Novi Financial, while Sam Blackshear, another co-founder and the CTO of Mysten Labs, was previously the Chief Engineer at Novi, having contributed significantly to the creation of the MOVE programming language used by Libra/Diem while at Meta. The founding team also includes Adeniyi Abiodun and George Danezis, key contributors to Diem's stablecoin and the aforementioned MOVE programming language -- the language now employed by Mysten Lab's blockchain, Sui.

Though past efforts of O.N.E. Amazon have involved collaborations with groups like the aforementioned Mysten Labs, the only ""official"" partners it lists on its website include MIT Media Lab, Satellogic, Aecom and Veea. The latter three have significant connections to the U.S. government, namely the U.S. military and intelligence community.

MIT Media Lab was previously the force behind the creation of the Digital Currency Initiative, which partnered with the U.S. Federal Reserve on assessing the feasibility of a U.S. dollar CBDC (that effort is known as Project Hamilton). It is also known for its prior yet very deep financial relationship with sex trafficker of minors, currency speculator and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein, who not only funded MIT Media Lab and cultivated a close relationship with its former head Joi Ito, but also brought in other major donors like Bill Gates and Leon Black. Epstein was extremely interested in cryptocurrency and previously invited crypto pioneer Brock Pierce to his island to speak on cryptocurrency. Pierce would later create the dollar stablecoin Tether (USDT) along with William Quigley, a long-time business partner of Bill Elkus, a former trustee of the J. Epstein Foundation and founding partner of Idealab, the first institutional investor in PayPal. MIT Media Lab appears to not have publicly commented on its partnership with O.N.E. Amazon.

The other partner of O.N.E. Amazon in its IoF project is Satellogic. Satellogic was recently the recipient of $30 million investment from Tether (USDT) and Howard Lutnick, the long-time CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald - the custodian of much of Tether's U.S. Treasuries, sits on the board. Lutnick and Cantor both hold 23.9% each of Satellogic shares, for a combined 47.8%. Lutnick was recently named co-chair of Donald Trump's transition team, where he will help Trump choose cabinet and other executive appointments if Trump's 2024 election bid is successful. Satellogic's board is also chaired by Steve Mnuchin, Trump's former Treasury Secretary who helped implement BlackRock's ""Going Direct"" plan months before and throughout the Covid-19 crisis. ""Going Direct"" put the bulk of money printed for economic relief intended to mitigate the effects of lockdown policies on regular Americans into the hands of Wall Street giants like BlackRock. BlackRock, whose head Larry Fink was tapped by Trump to develop the government's fiscal response to the crisis, used much of that money to buy shares in their own ETFs. The former Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. military under Trump, Joseph Dunford, is also on the board of Satellogic.

Aside from its board, Satellogic's co-founders, Emiliano Kargieman and Gerardo Richarte, were long-time contractors for DARPA, the NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies prior to founding Satellogic. Kargieman recently stated that the company's investment from Tether would help Satellogic advance more easily into the U.S. ""National Security market,"" i.e. intelligence contracts. Tether itself onboarded the FBI, the U.S.' domestic intelligence agency, and Secret Service onto its platform last year, allowing them to surveil and seize Tether from wallets deemed unfriendly by the U.S. government.

In addition, Satellogic, as we reported in Debt From Above, was also a key partner in an effort called GREEN+, which seeks to use satellite surveillance to turn Latin America's protected areas into tokenized carbon credits to be traded on the Bitcoin side-chain Rootstock (RSK) and to finance industrial projects that would construct an inter-continental ""smart grid"" digitally linking the Americas.

Satellogic isn't the only concerning firm partnered with O.N.E. Amazon. Another partner, Aecom, is the successor to the CIA-linked Ashland Oil and currently contracts extensively with USAID, widely believed to be a CIA front organization. In the 1970s, Ashland Oil pled guilty to multiple counts of making illegal domestic campaign contributions, which later became part of the Watergate scandal, and of bribing government officials in several countries. During this same period, Ashland was revealed to be a recipient of large amounts of CIA funds for ""undisclosed purposes,"" roughly half of which were paid in cash. Ashland, the CIA and the SEC all refused to comment on the nature of these payments. The Washington Post also reported in the late 1970s that the CIA had used Ashland Oil as ""a cover for an agent operating abroad."" In addition, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ashland Oil played a central role in a number of scandals that involved CIA veterans operating in Oman and Libya. Those veterans worked on behalf of what was known as the ""private CIA"" created during the Carter administration by Ted Shackley, the CIA's ""blonde ghost,"" and former CIA covert operations officer Thomas Clines. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, the ""private CIA"" cabal initiated what would become known as the Iran-Contra scandal and its members, including Clines, would become its main conspirators. The same group would later help give rise to Jeffrey Epstein and the networks that enabled his sexual and financial misdeeds.

The subsidiary of Ashland that would become Aecom, Ashland Technology, was formed in 1985, when Ashland was still steeped in clandestine intelligence ties. It was formally spun off in 1990, forming Aecom. Aecom, which now describes itself as an infrastructure firm serving governments, businesses and organizations, acquired long-time USAID, World Bank and Ford Foundation contractor PADCO (Planning and Development Collaborative International). It subsequently acquired a PADCO competitor, The Services Group, and launched Aecom International Development, making the company a major contractor to USAID. The Ford Foundation has long-standing connections to the CIA and USAID itself is widely believed to itself be a CIA front (see here, here, here and here). One of Aecom's partners on USAID contracts, the Nature Conservancy, is deeply connected to the efforts to financialize nature and use ""debt-for-nature"" or ""debt-for-climate"" swaps to force national governments in the Global South to implement certain policies favored by Nature Conservancy stakeholders, such as J.P. Morgan. Notably, a document provided by O.N.E. Amazon partner Veea to the SEC, claims that USAID is directly involved in O.N.E. Amazon's efforts along with unspecified ""UN agencies.""

Veea is a major developer of ""smart city"" technology that is pioneering the creep of those technologies into rural areas and farms. They are also a major provider of 5G technology. They have a deep relationship with U.S. military contractor Qualcomm, which describes itself as ""the driving force behind the development, launch and expansion of 5G."" Veea is one of Qualcomm's main partners in that endeavor. For instance, Veea is part of Qualcomm's Rural Cloud Initiative, which seeks to use 5G connectivity to ""digitally transform"" rural areas and agriculture through developing its AI-powered ""FarmGrid solution."" Veea is also part of Qualcomm's Smart Cities Accelerator Program. Veea is also a major provider of technology aimed at deploying the ""metaverse"" and augmented reality wearables. For example, last year, they announced a merger with augmented reality hardware producer Ostendo Technologies. As will be noted later, Peter Knez's venture before O.N.E. Amazon, the Venom Foundation, was also pushing into the metaverse. Ostendo is backed by the U.S. military's DARPA and Peter Thiel, who co-founded the deeply CIA-linked data-mining firm Palantir. Thiel is intimately connected to Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance and previously played a significant role in Trump's transition team during his first term in addition to being a major donor to Trump in the 2016 election. Ostendo has also worked as a contractor for the U.S. intelligence community's DARPA-equivalent IARPA.

Veea provides the hardware that links together the Internet of Forests (IoF) sensors, which were developed by MIT media Lab and ""others."" It states that building the IoF will occur in 5 phases, beginning with data infrastructure, followed by satellite and drone-provided imagery. The subsequent phases involve ""environmental sensing,"" ""socio-environmental sensing"" which appears to refer to surveilling the activities of locals living in the surveilled areas, and finally ""bio-sensing"" that will provide ""molecule-level insights.""

Veea frames the IoF project as ultimately leading toward an ""AI-driven neural network for our planet."" The effort to develop that neural network, framed as being founded on the ""principle that all species and ecosystems on this planet are part of a single system,"" are already underway. Called ""Enterprise Neurosystem,"" the goal is to ""link all the relevant climate networks and data sources"" for ""climate projects"" around the world into ""a single open AI framework"" and ""conduct a higher order analysis across all points of reference in real time."" This ""AI neurosystem"" would span the entire planet and its partners include not only Veea, but Microsoft, Google, Meta/Facebook, IBM, Intel and Yahoo!, among others. In other words, the IoF of O.N.E. Amazon is intended to eventually span every forest, everywhere, with major implications for nature and society.

In September 2022, O.N.E. Amazon signed an agreement with the indigenous organization FICSH, which represents the Shuar people of the Ecuadorian Amazon. FICSH, after reading the agreement more carefully, voted to cancel the agreement with O.N.E. Amazon just a few months later in early February 2023. Regional activist groups like Acción Ecológica have noted that the contract signed dramatically favored the interests of O.N.E. Amazon and put the Shuar at a major disadvantage.

For example, the surveillance systems placed in the forest as part of the agreement, i.e. systems like the Internet of Forests, would be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, and the company could use any type of surveillance device in Shuar territory and pass that data along to anyone they choose without oversight. In addition, any development or conservation project in Shuar territory related to the agreement are to also be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon and the company also possesses final authority over what private businesses or NGOs can enter Shuar territory to execute those projects.

The Shuar are also expected to help facilitate the surveillance of its territories by both the sensor network and by satellite, i.e. Satellogic, and those that ultimately purchase the O.N.E. Amazon digital asset security are also enabled to ""observe"" the Shuar's land via satellite per the contract. The proceeds from the sale from the security derived from Shuar land are also to be under the exclusive control of O.N.E. Amazon, with the Shuar only entitled to 15% of the profits that O.N.E. Amazon and its OAIF custody. The contract says the Shuar would receive half of their money within 30 days after the sale concludes and the remaining half would be disbursed annually over the remaining 30 year duration of the contract.

In addition, only O.N.E. Amazon can unilaterally cancel the agreement, meaning that the Shuar's rapid change of opinion in the contractual agreement could see them still wait decades before they are actually free of its terms. It also opens up the possibility that O.N.E. Amazon could cancel the contracts after selling its securities but before the 30 days they have to pay the Shuar their half of their meager share of the sales. Ultimately, as REDD-Monitor's Chris Lang noted, O.N.E. Amazon's contract with the Shuar ""would result in a panopticon-level of surveillance over"" their territory, give O.N.E. Amazon control over the monetization of that data, allow O.N.E. Amazon to choose what businesses can enter into and act upon Shuar territory without Shuar consent, and allow O.N.E. Amazon to make almost all of the money. O.N.E. Amazon seems to have secured the signing of this deeply inequitable contract by paying Shuar leadership $10,000 followed by $90,000 once the contract was signed. Yet, given what the Shuar have lost and stand to lose - and what O.N.E. Amazon stands to gain - $100,00 is next to nothing.

In addition to their past contracts with the Shuar, there is also the partnership between the Colombian government and O.N.E. Amazon to consider. O.N.E. Amazon, which no longer publicly discusses its past controversy with the Shuar, instead highlights their partnership with the government of Colombia and how the OAIF will be investing in ""energy transition and circular economy projects"" which will ostensibly benefit both the local environment and local inhabitants.

For instance, the proposed OAIF-funded project in Ciénaga involves a ""clean energy"" port and industrial park as well as two offshore wind projects to be placed off the coast of the Ciénaga port. The offshore wind projects will be entirely owned by BlueFloat, a Spanish offshore wind company. BlueFloat is a portfolio company of 547 energy, which itself is part of the Houston-based Quantum Energy Partners (now Quantum Capital). Quantum, traditionally focused on the oil and gas sector, has - since 2021 - been investing very heavily in carbon capture and carbon market infrastructure companies and it was reported in June 2024 that Quantum has been attempting to sell its stake in BlueFloat for €500 million.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, the Environmental Impact Assessments for the offshore wind projects will be performed by USAID contractor and O.N.E. Amazon partner Aecom. The bulk of the power generated by this plant will not go toward powering local communities but instead will mainly power the Ciénaga industrial park including the Ciénaga desalination and ""green"" hydrogen production plant as well as the proposed Ciénaga ""green"" mineral processing zone, which will process raw minerals from Chile and Argentina (likely lithium) and other South American countries. The area of Ciénaga, per O.N.E. Amazon, has 2000 hectares of industrial ""development potential.""

In addition, as noted by O.N.E. Amazon, the ""stakeholders"" they have engaged with respect to the offshore wind project does not include local inhabitants, indigenous groups or environmental activists. Instead, it includes ""authorities in key [Colombian government] institutions involved in the project"" as well as the British and Spanish embassies, which O.N.E. Amazon says are ""closely collaborat[ing]"" on the projects. It also states that there have been ""discussions"" with the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank, defined by the U.S. military as ""financial weapons"" of U.S. government power, about ""potential support schemes"" for the projects.

According to O.N.E. Amazon, locals who will benefit from these projects will merely be those employed as ""workers, maintenance personnel and [other employed] possibly in related activities such as transportation and logistics."" The proposed projects at Ciénaga will ""benefit"" indigenous tribes by ""conserving"" the ""black line"" (línea negra) that separates indigenous territory from non-indigenous territory.

In addition to Ciénaga, O.N.E. Amazon is backing the production of biocrude from agricultural biomass. The end result of the biocrude produced will be for the aviation industry, as it is intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The plants will be run and operated (and presumably owned) by two foreign companies - the Dutch company BTG Bioliquids and Alder Fuels (now Alder Renewables). BTG and Alder are partners.

Alder was founded by Bryan Sherbacrow, who embezzled $5.9 million from Alder and was sentenced to 3 years in prison this past June. In January 2023, shortly before Sherbacrow was removed from his role as CEO, Alder received millions from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop its SAF production process, which has also been tested at the DoE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ""with support from the U.S. Defense and Logistics Agency,"" part of the U.S. military. Alder is also seeking to use ""blockchain technology tools to account for all the emissions claims from the use of the SAF"" in order to ""generate the necessary records and transparency for compliance with regulatory frameworks, ESG standards and other sustainability commitments."" This will directly enable the functionality of carbon markets as it relates to air travel.

In summary, the O.N.E. Amazon's OAIF-funded projects in Colombia profiled above are industrial projects that will greatly benefit foreign companies and are being closely developed with foreign governments (like the UK and Spain) as well as entities that are funded by or are contractors for the U.S. government. Their ""environmental"" benefits are dubious and, while it would create industrial hubs that could theoretically generate economic growth for the population, the bulk of the infrastructure will be owned by foreign companies, which also receive the vast majority of the profits that result from these projects.

O.N.E. Amazons's sole known funder is Starlight Ventures, which funds companies that produce ""transformative technologies to fix the world."" Its other investments focus mainly on biotechnology, lab-grown meat, carbon market infrastructure, autonomous mining vehicles and space-related technologies, especially satellite surveillance firms. The firm was co-founded by Patricia Wexler, a Venezuelan-American businesswoman who previously worked with top Disney executives and then Elevation Partners, a significant investor in Facebook, Uber and other prominent tech companies.

Starlight Ventures also has ties to the Endeavor Network, which is deeply embedded in Latin America - particularly its cryptocurrency infrastructure - and is heavily funded by the controversial Bronfman family and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay and owner of PayPal from 2002 to 2015. For instance, one of its three venture partners is Santiago Bilinkis, one of the earliest fixtures in the Endeavor Network who - among other things - first connected Wences Casares, the founder of Xapo Bank, with Endeavor's Linda Rottenberg. Bilinkis later co-founded Wanako Games with Casares and has served on Endeavor's board of directors. Bilinkis is still involved with Endeavor's Argentina branch, serving on its Council of Founders alongside Argentine oligarchs like Eduardo Elzstain, host of the Bilderberg-style Llao Llao Forum in Bariloche, Argentina. Starlight also invests in some Endeavor-backed companies, like Satellogic, which is also considerably connected to Endeavor's Argentina branch.

According to an older profile written by Starlight Ventures about O.N.E. Amazon and cited by Acción Ecologica, an investor named Jalak Jobanputra is named the third co-founder of O.N.E. Amazon. Jobanputra, before founding her VC firm Future Perfect Ventures, was the director of Emerging Market Mobile Investments for Pierre Omidyar's the Omidyar Network and also previously worked for Intel and Lehman Brothers. While at the Omidyar Network, Jobanputra closed ""Omidyar's largest for profit investment ($5M) to date in Latin America, a wireless company that created credit profiles on unbanked middle income consumers using mobile data.""

It was reportedly during her time at the Omidyar Network that Jobanputra became interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrency. More specifically, it was her ""time spent in Africa analyzing the growth of the mobile money services platform M-Pesa,"" which led her to believe that crypto and bitcoin adoption were more likely to succeed in emerging markets. However, Jobanputra links adoption of these technologies to having a digital ID ""that you [can] have different assets associated with and can transact with."" Notably, the Omidyar Network is a long-time funder of technologies that enable CBDC issuance as well as Digital ID. In addition, through Endeavor, the Omidyar Network backs the biggest companies in Latin America's fintech space, effectively dominating the payment rails for crypto and bitcoin and therefore centralizing control over them and neutering the supposed ""decentralizing"" effects of cryptocurrency and bitcoin adoption.

In Jobanputra's case, her current VC firm has invested in a variety of crypto companies including BitGo, Blockstream and Celo. BitGo was founded by Mike Belshe, a big supporter of Trump VP pick JD Vance, alongside Ben Davenport and has previously custodied the U.S. government's bitcoin. Blockstream is fundamentally connected to Bitcoin Core and, thus, has played an outsized role in most of the past major updates made on the Bitcoin network, making them so important to that network that Endeavor's Reid Hoffman once suggested they would be the Microsoft or Google of blockchain (Hoffman is a key member of the Endeavor network and ""PayPal Mafia,"" and was previously a Blockstream board member and is also a major Blockstream investor). Celo is a ""mobile first,"" ""carbon neutral"" blockchain with a major focus on ""scaling voluntary carbon markets"" and stablecoins. Its investors include Reid Hoffman, Jack Dorsey and Coinbase Ventures. Celo has a particularly important relationship with Circle's dollar stablecoin USDC, which Coinbase's Brian Armstrong once suggested would become the U.S.' de facto CBDC. Circle and USDC are deeply connected to BlackRock, with BlackRock holding a minority stake in Circle, Circle's USDC being used to convert shares of BlackRock's first tokenized fund BUIDL into digital dollars, and the Circle Reserve Fund being managed by BlackRock.

O.N.E. Amazon co-founder Peter Knez began his career at Goldman Sachs as a Quantitive Research Associate, before joining Barclays' BGI as their Chief Investment Officer. While employed at Barclays, Knez personally oversaw the creation of their iShares brand, an essential pillar in the proliferation of the now-dominant ETF market. In a conversation with Nasdaq, Knez claimed that ""ETFs really only started with iShares at BGI."" According to Knez, ""there was a simple reason for developing it: we were the largest institutional asset manager without a mutual fund product and wanted to expand into retail."" The iShares ETFs ""allowed us to enter the retail market and compete with Mutual Funds"" by ""replicating existing indexes with a product that traded on exchanges, while disclosing their holding on a daily basis and delivering liquidity and transparency in a tax efficient format.""

Due to global collateral damage during the 2008 financial crisis, BGI was eventually acquired by BlackRock in 2009, who took the iShares brand to new heights, including the fastest growing ETF in history, the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF. When asked about BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, Knez implied ""we are in the early innings of the 'institutional' regime in cryptocurrencies and blockchain as the Wild West regime ends,"" and later described this institutional regime as ""characterized by increased participation of institutions like BlackRock and by governments"" while noting incoming ""legislation providing a regulatory framework for digital assets"" within the United States. Knez further claims that ""BlackRock wants to participate in this regulatory momentum"" and stated his believe that ""BlackRock will ultimately succeed"" due to their ""excellent track record"" while articulating suspicions that CEO Larry Fink ""would not have gone public if it was not pre-approved.""

Knez, however, has stated that Bitcoin as a speculative asset is less important than the underlying blockchain technology:

""My view is Bitcoin is to blockchain much like search or pornography was to the internet. It drove early adoption, but the underlying technology is much more important. Technologies that remove important frictions and improve benefit for society, those are the ones that persist. Blockchain, in my view, is such a technology, and the institutions believe it, too. I've talked to BlackRock, I had lunch today with very senior people at Morgan Stanley, they believe it too. And they're preparing for it. They're preparing for it because they know it's a quantum leap and they know they have to be in this game they cannot stand on the sidelines.""

In a conversation with CertiK, Knez noted that this imminent transformation was why he ""couldn't resist getting involved."" He later made reference to his former Goldman Sachs boss, Fischer Black, best known as one of the authors of the Black-Scholes equation, who ""started option pricing"" and ""created the whole notion of synthetic replication."" According to Knez, ""tokenization of real world assets is as big, or bigger than that"" and will ""dramatically change the way assets are managed"":

""Once you tokenize it, you can trade it. Once you can trade, it you can index it. Once you index, it you can write synthetics on it. That's transformative in a way that's never been transformed ever...The reason you see guys like Larry Fink pushing tokenization now is, for one, that Aladdin's about to have the functionality he wants for his clients. [And] number two, there's not a lot of alternatives to go scale the business. This is a way for the large institutions, whether it's Morgan Stanley or BlackRock or the other asset managers, this is a way for them to scale their business. And so that's why I think it's inevitable.""

In line with these beliefs, Knez participated in the launch of a new layer one blockchain, Venom, and alongside it founded the Venom Foundation in 2020. Other Venom Foundation members include Mustafa Kheriba, the Executive Chairman of Iceberg Capital; Dr. Kai-Uwe Steck, manager of Pontinova Circle Investment Group; Osman Sultan, the former CEO of DU Telecom and Founder of Fikratech; and Shahal M. Khan, Founder of Burkhan World, Trinity Hospitality Holdings and the CEO of Burtech. In August 2023, the Venom Foundation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United Arab Emirates Government to ""develop and implement the National Carbon Credit System"" in preparation of the country hosting COP28 that November. ""Venom Foundation has provided an unparalleled solution, acting as a key infrastructure for a global ecosystem for Web3 applications, with superfast transaction speeds and unlimited scalability to meet governments' needs."" Knez explained that the foundation is ""the first company in the UAE to develop and licence its blockchain technology and shape the future of national decentralised systems and digitise operations in corporate and government enterprises."" The MOU further covers ""green investment,"" ""adaptation to climate change,"" ""reducing carbon emissions,"" ""preparing and implementing a climate neutrality strategy,"" while ""enhancing partnership opportunities with the private sector.""

Knez expressed his excitement upon the signing of the MOU, commenting that the foundation is ""honored and excited to join hands with the UAE Government to build the National Carbon Credit System."" The press release claims that this was ""a revolutionary collaboration"" which demonstrates ""the UAE's unwavering commitment to bolstering transparency, reliability, and efficiency in carbon emission management"" via ""the next generation blockchain technology of Venom"" which boasts being ""carbon neutral."" Knez, the chair of the foundation, had previously told Nasdaqthat Venom was ""focused on three primary projects: stablecoins, carbon credits, and commodities"" and furthered that ""with respect to stablecoins"" the foundation was ""involved with governments and commercial banks in countries both in Africa and Asia."" Knez believes the ""combination of blockchain and smart contracts"" will ""profoundly transform financial services"" in the ensuing decade. ""They will be unrecognizable, as almost every core function in financial services will be transformed.""

In order to advance this transformation, the Venom Foundation partnered with Iceberg Capital, led by Venom foundation member Mustafa Kheriba, in January 2023 to form the Venom Ventures Fund (VVF). The goal of the VVF was to create ""a ten-figure war chest"" with $1 billion dedicated to ""accelerating the adoption of blockchain, DeFi, and web3 in MENA and beyond."" Knez was chosen to chair the venture, while readying ""strategic investments"" to ""transform digital asset management"" via the ""ideal platform for us to achieve this goal,"" the Venom blockchain. Interestingly, both the Venom Foundation and Iceberg Capital currently operate within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a ""fast-growing financial center situated in the heart of the UAE's capital."" It was founded a decade ago to ""promote entrepreneurship throughout the United Arab Emirates and the wider MENA region."" Venom had previously been granted ""a formal license to issue utility tokens by ADGM"" and according to Forbes, became ""the first blockchain to come under government agency control"" and to be ""monitored by a regulatory body.""

According to reporting from The Block, at the time of its announcement, the fund said it had led a $20 million investment in Nümi Metaverse and the next January announced a $5 million investment in Layer 1 blockchain Everscale, while ""no deals have been announced since."" In a December 2023 tweet, the Venom Foundation announced they will ""no longer continue operating in ADGM and in accordance with section 40 of the regulations, the Foundation has initiated the dissolution process.""

While there is little to show for the $1 billion fund launched in 2023, just last week, Venom announced a ""historic agreement with the government of the Republic of the Philippines"" in order to ""digitize billions of accountable forms using its advanced blockchain technology"" in ""what could end up as the world's largest blockchain use case,"" according to reporting from Gulf News.

Christopher Louis Tsu, the CEO of Venom Foundation, called Venom's selection by the Republic of the Philippines a ""testament to our platform's capabilities and the trust placed in our technology."" He furthered noted that ""by digitizing checks using Venom blockchain, we are not only reducing printing and processing costs but also significantly enhancing transparency and efficiency in financial operations"" demonstrating ""the massive utilization of the Venom blockchain in the form of hundreds of millions of Venom tokens annually"" while showcasing their ""commitment to delivering scalable, secure, and innovative solutions for national-level applications.""

These aspirations for further institutional and nation-state adoption of blockchain was seemingly echoed by Knez in a discussion with CoinTelegraph in March 2023:

""It is the early innings of the institutionalization of Web3. It's early innings, but it's going to happen... If you want to attract institutional money, you're going to have to seek regulation... The era of the Wild West is ending, which I think is good for everybody. So I advise them to to embrace the institutionalization, as that's what time it is.""

Now, with O.N.E. Amazon, it appears clear that Knez is seeking to again partner with major governments to tokenize real world assets, in this case the natural world, and to enable the advancement of a global carbon market/carbon offset economy.

The other co-founder and current CEO of O.N.E. Amazon is Rodrigo Veloso, a Brazilian entrepreneur who developed the O.N.E. Coconut Water brand, later sold to PepsiCo in 2012. That same year he co-founded Brazil's first online insurance company, Segurar.com, though it appears not to have launched until 2013. Around this time, in 2013, Veloso began working at Unik Capital, which operates in both the U.S. and Brazil, and he claims to still work there even though he is not mentioned on the company website. He has also claimed to be the founder of Unik Capital and that he used his funds from selling O.N.E. Coconut Water to Pepsi to do so. However, only CEO Sylvie Proia is listed as the founder on the company's website.

A year after joining Unik Capital, in 2014, Veloso attempted to acquire a decommissioned naval base in Puerto Rico and turn it into a ""mix of Disney World and Las Vegas,"" a ""green city with a focus on entertainment,"" marking his first foray into ""green"" business ventures that would later culminate with his role in co-creating O.N.E. Amazon. In addition to O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso also created another company called O.N.E. Natural Energy that specializes in producing syngas, which can be produced from ""a wide range of carbon-containing substances"" and is used to generate electricity or ""as a building block for a range of desirable commodities, from methanol to gasoline."" O.N.E. Natural Energy currently operates in Brazil.

A few years before creating O.N.E. Amazon, Veloso played an interesting role in the efforts to take Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of the Trump-centric social network Truth Social, public. Beginning in 2021, TMTG planned to merge with Digital World, a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC. The merger ultimately occurred in March of this year. The merger was controversial and fraught with scandals for Digital World. As a consequence of the insider trading allegations and fines from the SEC, former CEO of Digital World Patrick Orlando was fired from that role in March 2023 due to the scandals, though Orlando has sued the new CEO, Eric Swider, alleging Swider had planned a ""coup d'etat"" of Digital World to depose him.

Rodrigo Veloso is a close friend of Orlando's and was a Digital World board member from July 2021 until December 2022. Veloso was also present on a pre-merger call with Trump, while still a board member at Digital World, which later became a key focus of the SEC investigation into Digital World that ended with the SEC suing Orlando (the suit was filed after Orlando was fired from Digital World). The New York Times reported that Veloso was acting as an adviser to Orlando on the call. In addition to the SEC charges against Orlando, Digital World was fined $18 million by the SEC. There have been no allegations of TMTG itself engaging in improper trades or other activities related to charges against Digital World and its past executives. Ultimately, the SPAC merger between TMTG and Digital World added billions to Trump's net worth and allegedly provided a ""financial lifeline"" to the former president. Veloso, in addition to his ties to Orlando and Digital World, was also a board member/director of TMTG itself from September 2021 until December 2022, the same time he resigned from Digital World when the then-Orlando-led company was the subject of several investigations. Notably, during this same period of time (2021-2022), Veloso was laying the groundwork for the formal launch of O.N.E. Amazon, including efforts to trademark the Internet of Forests concept and signing the controversial agreement between O.N.E. Amazon and the Shuar in 2022.

In examining the efforts of O.N.E. Amazon and their recently announced partnership with Satellogic, it is worth dwelling on why a company like Satellogic, which is deeply tied to the stablecoin Tether and the U.S. Treasuries market through its board member Howard Lutnick, might wish to be involved with such an endeavor.

Much like a corporation, the United States government itself has a budget it must finance, partly through taxation of citizens and companies, but mostly via the issuance of new debt sold in the form of government bonds known as Treasuries. These securities are directly issued by the U.S. Treasury with the yield, or rate of the return, effectively set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and its governors via the Federal Funding Rate, commonly referred to as an interest rate. Typically, these bonds yield a higher rate of return the longer the duration for which they are issued. For example, a 30 year Treasury would yield a higher coupon than a 3 month Treasury to incentivize buyers to hold U.S. debt for greater periods of time, giving the government a longer runway to service their debt obligations. On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Committee cut the targeted federal funding rate to 0% due to ""the effects of the coronavirus"" weighing ""on economic activity in the near term"" and thus ""risks to the economic outlook.""

""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the Fed statement said. ""Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected."" Despite the ensuing lockdowns and widespread fear of the virus, President Trump praised the Fed that week, saying in a briefing at the White House that the rate cut ""makes me very happy."" In retrospect, the combination of government-mandated lockdowns and the Fed's aggressive rate cut, with unprecedented financial stimulus being distributed (with heavy profits) with collaboration from private sector stalwarts like BlackRock, systemically changed the financial system not just for the U.S., but the world at large. In fact, the Fed ""struck a deal"" with five other central banks including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, to ""lower their rates"" to ""keep the financial markets functioning normally.""

By printing trillions of dollars of newly issued debt at effectively 0% interest rates while simultaneously shuttering monetary velocity and demand alongside the businesses forced to close by their reactionary legislation, Trump's Treasury, led by current Satellogic board Chair Steve Mnuchin, massively increased the monetary supply and the U.S. government's debt obligations while minimizing the immediate inflationary effects of such stimulus. This unprecedented combination of Fed, Treasury and domestic policies allowed huge profits for the highest wealth bands in the nation, with those closest to the money spigot able to gobble up commodities with freshly printed dollars. Arguably, no company benefited more than BlackRock, having been a chief architect of the ""Going Direct"" plan, which allowed them to use these supposed pandemic relief funds to purchase large swaths of assets including from their own iShares ETF division, having acquired the Knez-led iShares from Barclay's during the 2008 crisis after the bank denied a government bail out of their own.

The same March 2020 week as the rate cuts, Bitcoin crashed to nearly $3000, oil futures went negative, and real estate and stock markets around the world collapsed, offering an unprecedented buying opportunity to those with the capital to take advantage -- namely the recently ""stimulated"" BlackRock. But the U.S. government still needed a buyer of Treasuries and while finding a new place to sink this freshly issued debt, the Fed itself began ""purchasing massive amounts of debt securities,"" a technique utilized during the 2008 crisis known as Quantitive Easing, or QE. As Brookings notes, the Fed aimed to ""restore smooth functioning"" to the ""Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets"" which ""play a critical role in the flow of credit to the broader economy.""

On March 15, 2020, the Fed ""shifted the objective"" of QE to supporting the economy, agreeing to purchase ""at least $500 billion in Treasury securities"" and ""$200 billion in government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities"" over ""the coming months."" A week later, on March 23, 2020, the Fed agreed to make the purchases open-ended, saying it would acquire securities ""in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" and thus ""expanding the stated purpose of the bond buying to include bolstering the economy."" By June 2020, the Fed lowered the rate of purchases to ""at least $80 billion a month in Treasuries"" and ""$40 billion in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities"" for the time being. The Fed again updated its policy in December 2020 to slow these purchases when the economy made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and in November 2021, the Fed began tapering the pace of securities purchases.

By October 2021, Bitcoin had rocketed to nearly $70,000, and alongside it arose a new insatiable buyer of U.S. debt via government-issued securities -- dollar stablecoin issuers, led by Tether and Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald. As previously reported by Unlimited Hangout:

""In the past 18 months, a new high volume net buyer of this debt has appeared in the cryptocurrency industry: stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers such as Tether or Circle have purchased over $150 billion of U.S. debt -- in the form of securities issued by the Treasury -- in order to ""back"" the issuance of their dollar-pegged tokens with a dollar-denominated asset. For some perspective on the absolutely astounding amount of volume these relatively young and relatively small businesses have gobbled up of U.S. debt, China and Japan, historically the U.S.' largest creditors, hold just under and just over $1 trillion, respectively, in these same debt instruments. Despite only existing for a decade, and despite only surpassing a $10 billion market cap in 2020, this leaves Tether alone at over 10% the Treasuries held by either of the U.S.' largest nation-state creditors.""

While the likes of Tether's USDT, alongside BlackRock-affiliated Circle's USDC and PayPal's PYUSD issued by Paxos, the U.S. has found partners for servicing the $35 trillion of already-issued debt alongside any future government budget as well as the modern evolution of the public-private partnership of capital creation while sustaining dollar hegemony across the globe via surveillable, programmable and seizable private bank currencies. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino previously claimed that Tether froze around $435 million in USDT for the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service on its path to becoming a ""world class partner"" to the U.S. to ""expand dollar hegemony globally.""

Lutnick's Cantor Fitzgerald, which holds Tether's T-Bills, is ""among the best-known bond trading houses on Wall Street"" and ""one of 25 primary dealers for U.S. Treasuries"" which allows ""direct trade with the Federal Reserve."" A report from September 2023 stated that Tether held $86.4 billion of assets in reserves with a later attestation report showing that USDT is mostly backed by U.S. Treasuries. By July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 5.5%, the ""highest level in 22 years,"" in hopes of making ""borrowing and investing more expensive."" With rates having risen faster than ever in U.S. history from the 0% target reached in March 2020, firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald -- net buyers of short duration securities known as T-Bills - are set to receive high yields with very little risk. In Tether's Q1 2023 Assurance Report, the stablecoin issuer held $81.8 billion with ""the majority of its reserves"" having been ""invested in U.S. Treasury Bills"" with ""all new issuance of tokens"" having ""been invested in U.S. Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo.""

In this same report, the company announced they would ""regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin (BTC)"" via ""utilizing realized profits from its investment strategy,"" which relied predominantly on short duration Treasuries. In Q1 2023, Tether held approximately $1.5 billion in bitcoin. By April 2024, the firm held approximately 75,354 bitcoin, worth nearly $4.5 billion today.

In Ardoino's statement regarding ""the decision to invest in Bitcoin"", the current CEO of Tether noted ""its limited supply"" as a reason for why the asset has ""emerged as a long-term store of value"" complete with ""substantial growth potential."" Whereas the U.S. government via the Treasury can continually issue these securities with no limit via a capped supply, bitcoin the asset has a predetermined issuance schedule, and an eventual total supply of just under 21 million bitcoin. The scarcity innate to bitcoin allows a debt-based financial system like the U.S. dollar system to continue to inflate into the demand inelastic, deflationary monetary policy of bitcoin. Now that the U.S. en masse has emerged, in no small part thanks to BlackRock's iShares IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF, as the world's largest known holder of bitcoin, complete with regulatory blessing from the likes of the DOJ and SEC, the Treasury has found willing market partners in their quest to service their debts and further dollarize the planet.

But it is perhaps within the planet itself that a new method for retaining U.S. dollar hegemony has emerged - the dollar-denominated, limited supply carbon market proposed by O.N.E. Amazon. Far from an unsubstantiated theory, Knez himself states precisely that the Amazon rainforest ""should be valued in the trillions"" and that his company is ""enabling the market to value it as such"" by ""turning it into an advanced digital asset security."" In a discussion with Gulf News, Knez took this one step further in explaining why the tangible parameters of the Amazon's size led to the creation of a limited supply of securities, providing the necessary mechanism to create a dollar-denominated debt sink out of the rainforest upon the security's appreciation:

""At O.N.E. Amazon, we are harnessing the power of the market - the same force that has driven exploitation - to transform it into a tool for conservation. We aim to prove that the Amazon is more valuable alive than dead.

We're not just environmentalists; we're innovators, economists, technologists, and community leaders. Together, we're developing a digital security asset - that represents the intrinsic value of the world's largest rainforest's biome. This isn't just a financial instrument; it's a statement, a commitment to the belief that the Amazon is valuable and ought to be priced. In terms of financial returns, investors will benefit from the potential capital appreciation of the digital security as the market values the positive environmental and social benefits of the rainforest's biome.

Given the finite size of the Amazon rainforest, the total number of securities will be restricted to 750 million, corresponding to the hectarage of the rainforest. This creates a limited supply of digital securities."" [emphasis added]

Due to the limited supply of digital securities, O.N.E. Amazon has created an axiom for vast capital appreciation of the asset itself, allowing a further expansion of dollar-denominated liabilities and thus further eventual demand for the dollar's underlying asset: U.S. Treasuries. Knez implies the Amazon should be valued in the trillions, and, much like he did in his role spearheading the iShares ETF brand, has created yet another growth market for the U.S. capital markets to ""quantitively ease"" into. Interestingly, this type of government debt expansion was theorized by RFK Jr.'s former running mate, Nicole Shanahan, in a project she led at Stanford titled ""An Analysis of Carbon Credit Markets as Validation for Climate Supportive Quantitative Easing Using the Blockchain"" described below:

""This project will provide a white paper for a carbon coin that works in tandem with the existing carbon credit (offset) markets. As an active venture investor in carbon credit markets such as Pachama and Joro Technologies, and a major customer of these offsets with my husband Sergey Brin, I will be leveraging the current entrepreneurial ecosystem to identify the economic, policy, and technological requirements to scale a carbon credit coin...While authors and futurists such as Kim Stanley Robinson (author of Ministry of the Future), have focused on the feasibility of governments issuing carbon coins in exchange for carbon sequestration, my argument is that a private market can first be situated to verify the accuracy of the carbon sequestration projects funded by the coin. The government can in turn, have evidence based results by which to sell government treasuries into the carbon coin network.""

These ""evidence based results"" of which Shanahan theorized, as it relates to the O.N.E. Amazon scheme, would presumably be the data provided by their satellite partner, Satellogic. Due to Satellogic's board being Chaired by former Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Cantor Fitzgerald's Lutnick large stake of shares and board position, and their funding by leading dollar-denominated stablecoin issuer Tether, the personnel and wherewithal to create such a debt sink at a time of dire need has been assembled.

As the U.S.' ballooning debt demands further areas to place their newly-issued debt, Knez and O.N.E. Amazon have all but directly proposed making the 750 million hectares of Amazon rainforest exactly that place.

O.N.E. Amazon's stated reasons for its business model - ostensibly ""preserving"" and ""conserving"" the Amazon - reflect a broader effort to frame efforts to centralize control over the global commons and build out a surveillance grid for both people and the planet as the only ""feasible"" means of rescuing the planet from catastrophe. However, as this article has endeavored to show, O.N.E. Amazon's interest is not in helping locals or indigenous groups or even in helping actually conserve the rainforest in the way most would imagine. Instead, the goal is to turn the Amazon rainforest into an exploitative farm - a farm for data that itself can be monetized and tokenized, just like the hectarage of the Amazon itself.

As the architects of Wall Street's new web3 economy search for new ways to store the wealth they have pilfered from the public through organized wealth transfers, more forms of ""digital gold"" will become a necessity. While bitcoin represents one digital store of value, the race is on to tokenize real world assets, especially the natural world and natural resources, in order to perpetuate the debt-based monetary system that has enabled the theft of regular people's wealth for centuries. Framed in altruistic terms of ""helping"" the environment and the have-nots, we are instead witnessing the ""datafication"" of all life both for profit and so that all life - including human beings and the natural world - can be surveilled, eventually down to the molecular level, and then ""managed"" by intelligent machines. Such a paradigm does not represent ""conservation"" or ""preservation,"" but rather the onboarding of our greatest natural treasures onto a system of hi-tech control, with every flutter of a butterfly wing and every branch swaying in the breeze being converted into bits and bytes that predatory bankers can trade and speculate on for profit.

O.N.E. Amazon is more than a company, it represents a model that others are following which seeks to borgify the natural world, and us along with it, claiming to ""harness the market"" to save us all from a vague yet impending doom. However, we and the forests are not being saved, we are being put in chains - forced into a prison without walls where the sensors to be placed on and in the trees and on and in our bodies will connect us to the bankers' blockchain of choice and allow us to be traded or sold, our biological signals and processes monetized for their benefit, and the masses of people, plants and animals on this planet to be ""managed"" by AI-powered machines that they program and control.",https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tokenizing-Nature-e1725115278986.jpg,0.3490196078431373

5 Next Cryptos To Explode As The Stock Market Is On The Rise

Here are the 5 next cryptos to explode as the stock market is on the rise;

5 Next Cryptos to Explode Reviewed

In this section, we reviewed each crypto with high potential growth to help you make the right decision when choosing the next crypto to explode.

Crypto All-Stars - World's First-Ever Meme Vault

One of the next cryptocurrencies expected to explode in the near future is Crypto All-Stars. This unique meme project has the potential for massive growth because it combines all popular meme coins into one unified staking platform called the Meme Vault that brings together meme coin traders and investors in one location. Users can stake their favorite meme coins, such as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe, Bonk, and others, and get $STARS tokens in exchange.

Generally, Crypto All-Stars is designed for a specific community of crypto enthusiasts who want to combine gaming, trading, and earning into one fun platform. Its launch has attracted attention from gamers and collectors due to its creative rewards system and community-driven features. The more $STARS tokens an investor holds, the more staking rewards they can earn. This makes it a smart move to buy $STARS tokens now while they are still sold at a discount before the presale ends and the token potentially takes off.

According to many crypto analysts, there are several reasons why Crypto All-Stars could be one of the next cryptos to explode. One key reason is the growing interest in gaming ecosystems, which continue to be among the most lucrative and highly growing businesses in the world. The project taps into this thriving market, and its roadmap shows plans for even more innovations, like cross-platform utilities and partnerships with well-known gaming brands. These moves could help bring in even more users and drive up the value of $STARS tokens.

Crypto All Stars tokens are currently sold in a presale, which already has raised over $1.1 million only a few weeks after its launch, indicating investors' trust and excitement in this cryptocurrency. For more info regarding the token's price, you can watch the Crypto All-Stars price prediction below:

Currently, early investors can buy $STARS tokens for just $0.0014305 each and stake their tokens for an impressive 1,200% annual percentage yield (APY). However, this high yield is dynamic and will decrease as more tokens are staked, meaning early stakers get the best rewards.

Bitcoin - Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization

There's no need to introduce Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is frequently referred to as a ""safe haven"" in the crypto and the financial world. As a matter of fact, many people refer to Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" because it's seen as a reliable store of value over the long term. In recent years, it is also widely used as an alternative to currencies with high inflation. In short, Bitcoin could be the currency of the future.

But despite the fact that it's the most established digital currency, Bitcoin still has plenty of room for growth due to factors like institutional adoption, its limited supply, and increasing use around the world. More than anything else, its limited number of 21 million coins makes it an attractive option for those seeking security in an unpredictable market. Moreover, because Bitcoin is decentralized, it is less affected by external forces; therefore, its value is frequently kept even when other assets fall in value.

Recently, following a price drop, $23 billion worth of Bitcoin has been moved into addresses held by long-term investors, showing institutional involvement in the Bitcoin market. The Bitcoin halving event that recently happened in April 2024 could also potentially drive Bitcoin's next bull run, with several experts predicting that Bitcoin could hit $85,000 by 2025, an increase of around 55% from Bitcoin's current price of $55,300.

Moreover, Bitcoin is no longer an anti-government currency used on the sidelines of the economy. Bitcoin is now recognized by many governments, including the United States, and is used as legal tender in countries like El Salvador.

Most importantly, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the US stock market in 2024 brought in large amounts of capital. Events like these, along with Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the highly anticipated US elections, can greatly affect Bitcoin's price, making it a key asset in the crypto space.

Mega Dice Token - The #1 GameFi On SOL

Next on our list is Mega Dice Token, one of the most promising GameFi tokens out there. Built on the Solana blockchain, Mega Dice Token ($DICE) powers a gaming ecosystem that includes a casino and sportsbook, offering bonuses and rewards to players and making it a potential breakout token.

The Mega Dice Casino, which was founded in 2023 and is licensed by Curacao, is also expected to deliver one of the best crypto casino experiences available, with $DICE tokens at the center of everything. Surely, if the casino gains more popularity, the value of $DICE could soar, much like how BNB grew alongside Binance's success.

By using blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent gaming experience, Mega Dice Token is transforming the online casino world. Unlike many other online casinos, Mega Dice ensures verifiable fairness and decentralized gaming, giving players more trust in the platform. As a result, Mega Dice has managed to build a platform with 10,000 users, and its user base is growing exponentially.

Furthermore, Mega Dice stands out from other online casinos by offering a unique gaming experience, which includes limited edition NFTs, referral bonuses, and airdrop rewards. Some key features of the platform include staking options, daily rewards, and exclusive NFTs. On its platform, users can stake $DICE in one of three pools to earn regular annual yields and daily rewards based on their gaming performance. All of the above has led some analysts to predict up to a 1000x potential growth for the Mega Dice token's price.

Mega Dice also plans to buy back and burn tokens using a portion of its profits, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The total supply of $DICE is fixed at 420 million tokens, with 35% available during the presale at $0.116056 per token, which can be purchased in exchange for SOL, BNB, and ETH. Additionally, 10% of the tokens are reserved for staking rewards.

Investors who want to learn more about the MegaDice Token can stay updated with recent information by following them on X and visiting the presale page.

Ethereum - Second Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization

Another crypto coin that has the potential to explode is Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world and the most popular blockchain for smart contracts. Ethereum has been the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts for many years. And, with the recent Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network now has better scalability, security, and sustainability. These improvements make Ethereum a very important investment for any serious crypto portfolio as they set the stage for future growth.

One of the reasons why Ethereum could explode soon is the shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), as it has significantly reduced Ethereum's environmental impact.

Moreover, earlier this year, the first Ethereum ETFs were approved and began trading on July 23. Although initial trading saw some outflows, analysts believe this could be a significant catalyst for Ethereum's future price growth. In the first five months, these ETFs might generate capital inflows ranging from $3 to $4.6 billion. This would lead to the purchase of 850,000 to 1.25 million ETH, potentially creating a supply shortage and driving prices higher.

In terms of price performance, Ethereum has been on a downtrend lately, currently trading around $2300. However, analysts still have a bullish outlook on Ethereum, especially when taking into account the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which is expected in Q4 2024.

All in all, Ethereum remains the most popular blockchain for developers, with most of the action in the crypto world, such as new crypto projects, play-to-earn games, and DeFi advances, happening on its platform. As Ethereum continues to grow, more developers will build on it, attracting even more users and increasing demand for ETH. Currently, Ethereum is priced at $2,324.8; however, some experts predict it could surpass $6,000 by 2025.

Shiba Shootout - The #1 Shiba Meme Coin

Another excellent altcoin worth watching in the upcoming months is Shiba Shootout, which is a fun, meme-based cryptocurrency that's gaining popularity thanks to its gamified features.

The $SHIBASHOOT token essentially allows holders to vote on project decisions and participate in features like the Lucky Lasso Lottery, where users can win crypto prizes and Savings Saddlebags. On its platform, users can earn Shiba tokens by taking part in interactive games and challenges, making it a fresh and exciting addition to the meme coin world.

One of the reasons why Shiba Shootout could explode is because Shiba Shootout combines entertainment with a reward system, making it stand out in the crowded meme coin space. Its growing community and unique approach to gamified rewards are likely to attract attention, especially as meme coins continue to capture investors' interest. With all of these features and the buzz around this token in the crypto community, analysts have set high expectations for the Shiba Shootout token.

So far, Shiba Shootout's presale has raised over $1 million in just a few months, indicating a strong demand for this crypto. One $SHIBASHOOT is currently trading for $0.0202, which, according to many analysts, is a discount price to what the coin might be traded when the presale ends. Also, if Shiba Inu continues to perform well, Shiba Shootout could benefit from the meme coin wave, delivering impressive gains to early investors. Its deflationary token burn also gives it a strong outlook, as reducing the supply could increase demand.

Overall, with its unique theme, strong community support, and long-term potential, Shiba Shootout could certainly be the next crypto to explode. For more information, check out the Shiba Shootout presale page below.

What is the Correlation Between the Crypto Market and the Stock Market?

Over the past few years, many analysts and crypto investors have wondered about the correlation between the stock and the crypto market.

Well, generally, the correlation between the stock market and the cryptocurrency market is complex and multi-faceted. While the two markets have distinct characteristics, they often move in tandem, especially during significant economic events. This is largely due to overlapping investor sentiment and the increasing institutional participation in both markets. When traditional markets are bullish, investors tend to have more risk appetite, prompting them to explore alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, which have historically offered higher returns despite their volatility.

For instance, one key reason for the correlation is the influence of global liquidity. When central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, implement policies that inject liquidity into the economy, both stocks and cryptocurrencies often benefit. Evidently, during periods of quantitative easing or low interest rates, investors seek to put their capital into assets with higher yield potential. Stocks and cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, often become attractive in such environments.

Another factor contributing to the correlation is the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios. Many institutional investors now view digital assets like Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio alongside stocks and bonds. This means that macroeconomic factors affecting stock market sentiment, such as changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, or geopolitical events, can also affect crypto markets.

Additionally, as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, they are increasingly subject to similar market forces that affect traditional financial assets, such as regulatory changes and shifts in global economic policy.

In short, cryptocurrency prices and stock prices indeed tend to move in parallel. However, it's important to note that while the correlation exists, cryptocurrencies remain far more volatile than stocks. This heightened volatility means that while they may follow stock market trends, their price movements can be significantly more exaggerated, both on the upside and downside.

When Will the Crypto Market Explode?

Predicting when the next major surge in the crypto market will occur is a bit challenging, but there are a few important factors and events that could trigger significant growth. When looking ahead, these events and trends are worth paying attention to, as they may play a crucial role in the next big price increase.

US Elections (2024)

The upcoming U.S. presidential elections in 2024 could have a major impact on the crypto market. If a candidate with a strong pro-crypto stance, like Donald Trump, wins the election, this could greatly boost confidence among investors as a government that supports cryptocurrencies might lead to more favorable regulations, less scrutiny, and increased adoption of digital assets.

This potential shift in policy could spark an influx of institutional money into the market and help push crypto prices higher. Investors often react positively when they believe political leaders will create a supportive environment for emerging technologies, so the election results could be a big catalyst for the market.

Federal Reserve Rate Cuts

The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions is another important factor to watch. When interest rates are high, investors tend to move their money into safer assets such as bonds, but when the Fed lowers interest rates, borrowing money becomes less expensive, and people are more inclined to invest in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies.

Lower interest rates also make it easier for businesses to expand, which boosts the economy and stock markets and, by extension, can positively affect crypto markets. If the Fed cuts rates shortly, it could lead to a surge of capital into cryptocurrencies as investors look for higher returns. Also, historically, low interest rates have been linked to strong bull runs in the cryptocurrency market.

Technological Upgrades

Blockchain technology continuously evolves, and key upgrades could be a big driver of the next crypto boom. Ethereum, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, is constantly working on improving its network. For example, the move to Ethereum 2.0 and the integration of Layer 2 scaling solutions aim to make the network faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

These upgrades will not only improve Ethereum's performance but also attract more developers and users to the network. And as the technology behind major cryptocurrencies improves, it could lead to increased adoption and drive up prices. In addition, advances in other blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could further fuel interest in the market.

Institutional Adoption

Perhaps one of the most significant factors that could cause the crypto market to explode is the continued entry of institutional investors. When big players like hedge funds, banks, and corporations invest in crypto, it creates a wave of confidence in the market. We've already seen companies like BlackRock, PayPal, and Tesla getting involved in cryptocurrencies, whether through investments, partnerships, or enabling crypto payments. As more institutions adopt digital assets, the market becomes more legitimized and stable, which attracts even more investors. The growing interest from traditional financial firms signals that the future of cryptocurrencies is being taken seriously, and as institutional money flows in, it could lead to major price increases.

These factors, combined with a general increase in public awareness and interest in cryptocurrencies, make the market ripe for a potential explosion, and while it's impossible to pinpoint an exact date, keeping an eye on these key developments can give investors valuable insights into when the next big wave might hit.

Final Word

In sum, as the stock market continues its upward momentum, the five cryptocurrencies mentioned in this guide - Crypto All-Stars, Bitcoin, Mega Dice Token, Ethereum, and Shiba Shootout - are well-positioned to capitalize on future market trends. Each one of these tokens offers a mix of stability, innovation, and potential for explosive growth.

5 predicciones sobre el mercado cripto que aún no se han cumplido,https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-prediction-nfts-privacy-metaverse-bitcoin,2024-08-30,Cointelegraph,"Las narrativas cripto a veces prometen un viaje a la luna, pero no todos los cohetes lo consiguen, y los mercados tienden a tener una memoria descuidada, cayendo a menudo en las mismas trampas.

El éxito en el comercio de criptomonedas depende a menudo de un profundo conocimiento de los fundamentos, de una aguda capacidad de análisis técnico o del acceso a la inteligencia de mercado.

Sin embargo, la fuerza que impulsa el movimiento de los precios a menudo se reduce a las narrativas del mercado.

Estas historias sobre el mercado pueden o no tener fundamentos sólidos, pero respetarlas es crucial para tener éxito en la inversión en criptomonedas.

También hay una trampa: las narrativas a menudo surgen con fuerza, pero pueden desvanecerse con la misma rapidez.

En 2024, varias narrativas cripto han tomado el centro del escenario.

Las memecoins son una de las tendencias más peculiares, que prosperan gracias al hype, el humor y las fuertes comunidades en línea a pesar de carecer de valor intrínseco o de cualquier utilidad real. Estos tokens suelen atraer a los que buscan ganancias rápidas, pero su longevidad sigue siendo cuestionable.

También han aparecido narrativas más serias, como el crecimiento de las redes descentralizadas de infraestructuras físicas (DePIN) y la tokenización de activos del mundo real (RWA), que pretenden resolver problemas reales.

Las DePIN se centran en la descentralización de infraestructuras como las redes de energía utilizando blockchain, mientras que la tokenización de RWA [activos del mundo real] se refiere a la tokenización de activos como bienes inmuebles y materias primas. Los expertos predicen que la tokenización de los RWA podría desbloquear un mercado de USD 30 billones, aunque todavía no se ha materializado.

La noticia dominante es la aprobación de los fondos cotizados (ETF) de Bitcoin (BTC) y Ether (ETH) al contado.

Los ETF tienden un puente entre las finanzas tradicionales y las criptomonedas, fomentando la adopción institucional y legitimando el mercado. Sólo el ETF de Bitcoin de BlackRock ha adquirido más de USD 20,000 millones en BTC, alimentando el optimismo y el crecimiento del mercado.

A medida que estas narrativas evolucionan, el pasado demuestra que muchas tendencias tienden a desvanecerse o a no cumplir las expectativas, y Cointelegraph ha echado un vistazo a cinco grandes narrativas de mercado que aún no han dado resultado.

Lightning Network hará de Bitcoin una moneda viable para pagos

En el 2008 Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto creó Bitcoin para ser una moneda digital independiente de bancos centrales e instituciones:

""Una versión puramente peer-to-peer del dinero electrónico permitiría que los pagos en línea se envíen directamente de una parte a otra sin pasar por una institución financiera"".

Un gran obstáculo para el uso de Bitcoin como moneda de pago es la lentitud de las transacciones en la red.

Visa puede gestionar 24,000 transacciones por segundo (TPS), Mastercard puede realizar 5,000, y Bitcoin puede gestionar actualmente un máximo de siete. Las dramáticas diferencias entre estas plataformas de pago digital demuestran que Bitcoin debe encontrar una solución a sus velocidades de transacción para convertirse en una moneda de pago viable.

Lightning Network (LN) es una de esas soluciones.

Lightning es un protocolo de capa 2 desarrollado sobre la blockchain de Bitcoin que puede procesar pagos en una red paralela más rápida y ligera para eliminar tráfico de la blockchain principal. En teoría, la LN puede enviar 1,000,000 de TPS y liquidarlos todos al instante.

La adopción de Lightning ha crecido a medida que aumentaba el número de nodos y los exchanges de criptomonedas adoptaban la tecnología. Las expectativas de que Lightning convirtiera Bitcoin en una moneda de pago viable eran altas, pero aún no ha estado a la altura.

Lightning se ha topado con problemas relacionados con la privacidad y la liquidez de la red, que añaden una capa extra de complejidad técnica al uso de criptomonedas y dificultan su adopción global.

La solución L2 no ha fracasado, pero necesita mejoras para gestionar los pagos en todo el mundo.

Blockchain es la solución a todo

""Ponlo en un blockchain"" ha sido durante mucho tiempo un término en el mundo de los negocios para exagerar algo sin proporcionar ningún beneficio real.

La carrera alcista de las criptomonedas de 2017 y el auge de las ofertas iniciales de monedas introdujeron las criptomonedas al gran público.

Blockchain se promocionó rápidamente como una tecnología que podría resolver los problemas de cualquier sector empresarial.

Blockchain mejoraría los sistemas de distribución global, eliminaría la corrupción gubernamental, protegería las elecciones, proporcionaría identidad digital, establecería derechos de propiedad intelectual... y la lista continúa.

Durante la carrera alcista de las criptomonedas de 2017, blockchain se convirtió en una palabra de moda mientras las empresas intentaban utilizar versiones de la tecnología para mejorar sectores o llamar la atención.

Proyectos como PetChain, que utilizaba blockchain para hacer un seguimiento de los animales domésticos, y Dentacoin, cuyo objetivo era crear un ecosistema descentralizado para mejorar diferentes aspectos de la atención dental, fueron algunos de los casos de uso más inusuales de blockchain.

Hoy damos una cálida bienvenida a nuestra tercera clínica asociada en Uganda: Wana Dental Clinic y su propietario, el Dr. Alex Ndikumwami. La misión del equipo de la clínica es devolver sonrisas saludables a los pacientes y garantizar una mejor vida social para más personas.

El hype en torno a blockchain eclipsó sus beneficios, dando lugar a muchos proyectos que a menudo carecían de utilidad en el mundo real. Cuando se asentó el polvo, quedó claro que blockchain puede abordar retos específicos, pero no todos los problemas requieren una solución blockchain.

El sueño NFT de la propiedad digital

Los tokens no fungibles surgieron en enero de 2021, recibiendo la atención el público mainstream en marzo de 2021, cuando el criptoempresario Sina Estavi compró el primer tuit del cofundador de Twitter Jack Dorsey como NFT por USD 2.9 millones.

Actualmente, la mejor oferta por este NFT es de poco más de USD 2,000 o 0.8 Ether (ETH) a los precios actuales, según OpenSea.

Los NFT ofrecían la posibilidad técnica de demostrar la propiedad sobre contenidos digitales. Se trataba de algo revolucionario, ya que podía transformar varios sectores y crear un mercado de activos de juego y coleccionables digitales.

Los NFT pretendían resolver un problema para los artistas digitales, cuyas obras de arte podían ser fácilmente duplicadas o robadas. El token ofrecería una prueba de propiedad, y la obra de arte se incluiría en su acuñación.

La aparición de un nuevo mercado digital produjo uno de los ciclos de hype más locos de la historia de las criptomonedas, en el que los compradores se dejaron llevar por la locura de ser los primeros poseedores de determinados NFT.

Se invirtieron millones de dólares en colecciones de NFT y en colecciones de fotos de perfil generadas por ordenador (PFP), con ligeras diferencias. La locura alcanzó su punto álgido, pero en la actualidad, los NFT se venden con grandes pérdidas.

Las razones de la caída de los NFT podrían estar relacionadas con su uso para operaciones de lavado, la falta de protección de los derechos de autor y las numerosas estafas que empañaron su imagen pública, acabando por ahuyentar a los inversores.

A pesar de que el gran público asocia los NFT con fotos de perfil de monos, siguen ofreciendo muchos casos potenciales de uso en el mundo real.

En el sector inmobiliario, podrían rastrear la propiedad histórica, mientras que en el académico pueden permitir la verificación inmutable de certificados. Podrían desarrollarse sistemas antifalsificación para el sector de la venta de entradas y nuevos enfoques para la gestión de la identidad digital y la reputación mediante variantes de NFT como los tokens soulbond propuestos por el cofundador de Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin.

Estas aplicaciones sólo se pondrán en práctica si los NFT logran el respaldo legal o la aceptación generalizada de los mercados y los consumidores.

El metaverso proporcionará una nueva frontera para las interacciones sociales

En 1985, Habitat de Lucasfilm -un videojuego para el Commodore 64- proporcionó el primer ejemplo de un ciberespacio virtual en el que los usuarios podían interactuar.

Siete años después, en 1992, Neal Stephenson acuñó el término ""metaverso"" en su novela Snow Crash.

En la década de 1990, el metaverso parecía a punto de convertirse en realidad con la aparición de los cascos de realidad virtual (RV), anunciados como una revolución tecnológica. Sin embargo, el mercado se sobredimensionó y no llegó a imponerse, debido sobre todo a las limitaciones tecnológicas.

Sin embargo, los recientes avances en realidad aumentada (RA), auriculares de RV y un ancho de banda de Internet más rápido reavivaron el interés por el metaverso.

El gran momento llegó cuando Mark Zuckerberg anunció el cambio de marca de Facebook a Meta y prometió un compromiso de inversión y desarrollo del metaverso.

La narrativa cripto del metaverso gira en torno a la creación de un universo digital descentralizado e inmersivo en el que los usuarios puedan interactuar, crear y realizar transacciones en un espacio virtual. Blockchain y las criptomonedas ofrecían la posibilidad de permitir la propiedad digital real y la interoperabilidad, así como de desarrollar potencialmente nuevos sistemas económicos digitales.

Al igual que ocurrió con la moda de los NFT, una avalancha de dinero se volcó en proyectos metaversos que utilizaban blockchain. Se vendieron inmuebles virtuales por cantidades astronómicas de dinero, como las 116 parcelas de ""tierra"" digital vendidas por USD 2.4 millones.

Sin embargo, la repentina fiebre por plataformas metaversas líderes como The Sandbox y Decentraland duró poco.

A pesar de haber recaudado millones, los datos de DappRadar indican que Decentraland cuenta con unos 300 usuarios activos diarios, mientras que The Sandbox tiene unos 200.

El hype de la inversión metaverso puede haber llegado demasiado pronto. Un producto poco desarrollado no cumplió las expectativas de juego y acabó aburriendo a los usuarios. Meta perdió USD 16,000 millones en 2023 y sigue perdiendo dinero con sus inversiones en metaversos. Con nuevas mejoras tecnológicas, aún podría surgir un metaverso rentable y activo; sólo el tiempo lo dirá.

Las monedas de privacidad se pondrán de moda porque la gente quiere realizar transacciones en privado

Contrariamente a la creencia popular, las criptomonedas no proporcionan inherentemente un anonimato total. La mayoría operan en una blockchain pública, que ofrece seudonimato en el mejor de los casos.

Las principales monedas de privacidad, como Monero (XMR) y Zcash (ZEC), se crearon para preservar el anonimato en las transacciones financieras y garantizar la privacidad financiera.

Estas monedas se dispararon en la carrera alcista de 2017 y volvieron en 2021. Cuando los reguladores pusieron sus ojos en las monedas de privacidad, se renovó el interés por ellas.

Sin embargo, parece que las fuerzas reguladoras están ganando la batalla hasta ahora.

Las monedas de privacidad han sido estigmatizadas debido a la constante presión reguladora por su asociación con actividades ilícitas como el blanqueo de capitales y la evasión fiscal.

A pesar de los aumentos de precios en 2017 y 2022, muchos exchanges comenzaron a retirar de la lista las monedas de privacidad en 2022 para evitar reacciones regulatorias a medida que aumentaba la presión, lo que limitó gravemente la liquidez y la accesibilidad.

Las capacidades de las fuerzas de seguridad también han evolucionado con la mejora de herramientas forenses avanzadas y empresas de análisis de blockchain que pueden rastrear determinadas transacciones. Aunque Monero no fue descifrada, el hecho de que otras monedas de privacidad pudieran ser rastreadas debilitó su argumento de venta de ser completamente irrastreables.

Además, la mayoría de los usuarios comunes de criptomonedas se sienten suficientemente seguros con el seudonimato que ofrecen criptomonedas convencionales como Bitcoin o Ether, con propuestas para que sean más privadas, lo que reduce el atractivo de las monedas de privacidad de nicho.

Best Practices for Avoiding Phishing and Scams in the Crypto World,https://techbullion.com/best-practices-for-avoiding-phishing-and-scams-in-the-crypto-world/,2024-08-27,TechBullion,"Best practices for avoiding phishing and scams in the crypto world: protect your digital assets

The cryptocurrency industry has seen explosive growth over the past decade, attracting millions of investors, traders, and enthusiasts worldwide. However, with this rapid growth has come an increase in the number of cybercriminals seeking to exploit the relatively new and often poorly understood landscape of digital assets. Phishing and scams are among the most prevalent threats facing cryptocurrency users, posing significant risks to both individual investors and the broader market.

This detailed article aims to educate crypto users on the best practices for avoiding phishing and scams in the crypto world. We will explore the most common types of phishing attacks and scams, how to identify them, and the steps you can take to protect your assets and personal information.

Understanding Phishing in the Crypto World

Phishing is a form of cyber attack where criminals impersonate legitimate entities to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as private keys, passwords, or personal identification details. In the context of cryptocurrency, phishing attacks often target users' wallets, exchange accounts, and other digital assets.

Common Phishing Tactics Email Phishing: Cybercriminals send emails that appear to be from legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, or other trusted entities. These emails often contain links to fake websites designed to steal your login credentials. Spear Phishing: A more targeted form of phishing, spear phishing involves personalized emails or messages aimed at specific individuals. The attacker may have some information about the victim, making the scam appear more credible. SMS Phishing (Smishing): Attackers send text messages that appear to be from a trusted source, urging the recipient to click a link or respond with personal information. Social Media Phishing: Scammers create fake social media profiles that resemble those of legitimate companies or influencers in the crypto space. They may offer giveaways, promotions, or investment opportunities that require you to share personal information or send cryptocurrency. Phishing Websites: These are fake websites that mimic the appearance of legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, or service providers. When users attempt to log in, their credentials are stolen. Recognizing Common Crypto Scams

Beyond phishing, the crypto world is rife with various scams designed to trick users into parting with their money or personal information. Some of the most common scams include:

Ponzi Schemes: These are fraudulent investment operations where returns are paid to earlier investors from the contributions of newer investors. Eventually, the scheme collapses, and most participants lose their money. Pump and Dump Schemes: Scammers artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency through false or misleading statements, encouraging others to buy in. Once the price has been pumped up, the scammers sell off their holdings, causing the price to crash. Fake ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings): Scammers create fake projects or cryptocurrencies, promising high returns to investors. After collecting funds, they disappear, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Rug Pulls: In decentralized finance (DeFi), a rug pull occurs when developers create a new token, attract investors, and then suddenly withdraw all the liquidity, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Impersonation Scams: Scammers impersonate well-known figures in the crypto world, offering fake giveaways or investment opportunities. Victims are asked to send cryptocurrency with the promise of receiving more in return, but they receive nothing. Best Practices for Avoiding Phishing Attacks

Given the prevalence and sophistication of phishing attacks, it is crucial to adopt best practices to protect yourself. Here are some strategies to help you avoid falling victim to phishing attacks in the crypto world:

Verify the Sender's Identity: Before clicking on any link or sharing information, verify the sender's identity. Check the email address, phone number, or social media profile for signs of impersonation. Legitimate companies will not ask for sensitive information via email or text. Be Cautious with Links: Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media posts. Instead, manually type the website address into your browser or use a bookmarked link to ensure you are visiting the legitimate site. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable two-factor authentication on all your cryptocurrency accounts. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. Check for HTTPS: When accessing a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet, ensure the website address begins with ""https://"" and not ""http://"". The ""s"" stands for secure, indicating that the website uses encryption to protect your data. Keep Your Software Updated: Regularly update your browser, operating system, and security software to protect against the latest threats. Cybercriminals often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to launch phishing attacks. Be Wary of Urgency: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into taking action without thinking. If you receive a message urging you to act quickly, take a moment to verify its authenticity before proceeding. Use a Password Manager: A password manager can help you create and store strong, unique passwords for each of your cryptocurrency accounts. This reduces the risk of using the same password across multiple sites, which can be exploited in a phishing attack. Educate Yourself Continuously: Phishing tactics are constantly evolving. Stay informed about the latest threats by regularly reading cybersecurity news and updates from reputable sources. Double-Check Transaction Details: Before sending any cryptocurrency, double-check the wallet address and amount. Scammers can use malware to change the address after you copy and paste it. Report Phishing Attempts: If you receive a phishing email or message, report it to the relevant authorities or the company being impersonated. This can help prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. Best Practices for Avoiding Crypto Scams

In addition to phishing, there are several other best practices you can adopt to protect yourself from scams in the crypto world:

Research Before Investing: Before investing in any cryptocurrency, ICO, or DeFi project, thoroughly research the team, technology, and business model. Look for reviews, whitepapers, and other documentation that can help you assess the legitimacy of the project. Beware of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment opportunity promises guaranteed returns or sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Be skeptical of any project that claims to offer risk-free or excessively high returns. Use Reputable Exchanges and Wallets: Stick to well-known and reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. These platforms are more likely to have robust security measures in place to protect your assets. Diversify Your Investments: Avoid putting all your money into a single cryptocurrency or project. Diversifying your investments can reduce your risk and help protect your portfolio from scams and market volatility. Be Skeptical of Social Media Offers: Scammers often use social media to promote fake giveaways, airdrops, or investment opportunities. Be cautious of unsolicited offers and verify the legitimacy of any promotion before participating. Secure Your Private Keys: Your private keys are the most important piece of information in the crypto world. Never share your private keys with anyone, and store them in a secure, offline location, such as a hardware wallet. Avoid Public Wi-Fi: When accessing your cryptocurrency accounts, avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, which can be easily compromised by hackers. Instead, use a secure, private internet connection. Enable Security Alerts: Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets offer security alerts that notify you of any suspicious activity on your account. Enable these alerts to stay informed about potential threats. Understand DeFi Risks: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms can offer lucrative opportunities, but they also come with unique risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities and liquidity issues. Understand these risks before participating in DeFi projects. Trust Your Instincts: If something feels off or you have doubts about an investment or transaction, trust your instincts. It's better to miss out on a potential opportunity than to fall victim to a scam. Case Studies: Real-World Examples of Phishing and Scams in Crypto

To better understand the risks and consequences of phishing and scams in the crypto world, let's explore a few real-world case studies:

1. The Twitter Bitcoin Scam (2020)

In July 2020, one of the most high-profile cryptocurrency scams occurred on Twitter. Hackers gained access to the accounts of several prominent individuals, including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Barack Obama, and posted tweets promoting a Bitcoin giveaway scam. The tweets urged followers to send Bitcoin to a specific address with the promise of receiving double the amount in return.

The scam was a classic example of social media phishing, leveraging the credibility of well-known figures to deceive followers. Despite the obvious red flags, the scam successfully netted the hackers over $120,000 in Bitcoin before it was shut down.

Lessons Learned:

Always verify the authenticity of offers or giveaways, especially on social media. Be skeptical of promises of guaranteed returns or ""too good to be true"" opportunities. 2. The MyEtherWallet Phishing Attack (2018)

In April 2018, users of MyEtherWallet (MEW), a popular Ethereum wallet, fell victim to a phishing attack that resulted in the theft of over $150,000 worth of Ethereum. The attackers used a DNS hijacking technique to redirect users from the legitimate MEW website to a fake one. When users entered their private keys into the fake site, the attackers were able to steal their funds.

Lessons Learned:

Always double-check the URL of any cryptocurrency-related website before entering sensitive information. Use security measures such as browser extensions that can help detect phishing sites, and consider bookmarking legitimate sites to avoid falling victim to URL hijacking. 3. The BitConnect Ponzi Scheme (2016-2018)

BitConnect was a cryptocurrency lending and exchange platform that promised extraordinarily high returns to investors. The platform claimed that users could earn interest as high as 1% per day through a trading bot. However, in reality, BitConnect was operating a Ponzi scheme, where returns to existing investors were paid out using the capital from new investors.

In January 2018, the platform collapsed, leading to massive losses for investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later charged the founders and promoters of BitConnect with defrauding investors out of billions of dollars.

Lessons Learned:

Be wary of investment opportunities that promise guaranteed high returns with little to no risk. Always conduct thorough research into any platform or project before investing, and seek out independent reviews and analysis. 4. The Mt. Gox Exchange Hack (2014)

Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, handling over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions globally. However, in 2014, the exchange was hacked, resulting in the loss of approximately 850,000 Bitcoins, valued at around $450 million at the time. The hack was one of the largest and most devastating in the history of cryptocurrency.

The hack exposed significant vulnerabilities in the exchange's security practices, and it ultimately led to the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox.

Lessons Learned:

Use reputable and secure exchanges with a proven track record of protecting user funds. Consider storing the majority of your cryptocurrency holdings in a hardware wallet rather than on an exchange, which is more vulnerable to hacks. 5. The PlusToken Scam (2019)

PlusToken was a high-yield investment platform that primarily targeted users in China and South Korea. The platform claimed to offer returns as high as 9% per month through its token, PLUS. However, in reality, PlusToken was a pyramid scheme, and the operators behind it absconded with over $2 billion in cryptocurrency from investors.

In 2019, Chinese authorities arrested several individuals involved in the scam, but the vast majority of the stolen funds have not been recovered.

Lessons Learned:

Be cautious of platforms that offer referral bonuses or incentives to recruit new investors, as this is a common feature of pyramid schemes. Verify the legitimacy of any investment platform by checking for transparency, regulatory compliance, and third-party audits. Additional Tips for Staying Safe in the Crypto World

Beyond the best practices mentioned earlier, there are additional strategies you can adopt to protect yourself from phishing and scams in the crypto world:

Regularly Monitor Your Accounts: Keep a close eye on your cryptocurrency accounts and wallets for any unusual activity. Promptly address any unauthorized transactions or changes to your account settings. Educate Others: Share your knowledge about phishing and scams with friends, family, and colleagues who are involved in cryptocurrency. The more people are aware of these threats, the harder it becomes for scammers to succeed. Participate in Community Forums: Engage with the cryptocurrency community through forums, social media groups, and other platforms. These communities often share warnings about new scams and phishing attempts, helping you stay informed. Use Cold Storage for Long-Term Holdings: For long-term cryptocurrency holdings, consider using cold storage solutions, such as hardware wallets, which are offline and less susceptible to hacks and phishing attacks. Understand the Regulatory Landscape: Stay informed about the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in your country. Regulatory bodies often issue warnings and guidelines to help protect investors from scams. Be Careful with Airdrops and Free Offers: Scammers often use fake airdrops or free token offers to trick users into revealing their private keys or sending cryptocurrency. Only participate in airdrops from reputable projects and verify their legitimacy before engaging. Review Smart Contracts: If you're participating in DeFi projects, take the time to review the smart contracts involved. Look for audits by reputable firms that confirm the code's security and functionality. Stay Updated on Scam Trends: Scams evolve over time, with new tactics emerging as old ones become less effective. Regularly read up on the latest trends in crypto scams to stay ahead of potential threats. Use Multi-Signature Wallets: For added security, consider using multi-signature wallets, which require multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This adds an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. Have a Recovery Plan: In the unfortunate event that you fall victim to a phishing attack or scam, have a recovery plan in place. This might include reporting the incident to the authorities, contacting your exchange or wallet provider, and notifying others in the community to prevent further losses.

As the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow, so too do the threats posed by phishing attacks and scams. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new tactics to deceive and exploit unsuspecting users, making it essential for everyone involved in the crypto world to remain vigilant and informed.

By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to phishing attacks and scams. From verifying the legitimacy of emails and websites to using two-factor authentication and secure storage solutions, these strategies will help you protect your digital assets and personal information.

Remember that in the crypto world, the responsibility for security largely rests with the individual. By staying educated, skeptical, and proactive, you can navigate the complex and often perilous landscape of digital currencies with confidence.

Crypto Gems: Top crypto assets to watch & buy in September 2024,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/crypto-gems-top-crypto-assets-to-watch-buy-in-september-2024/articleshow/113088423.cms,2024-09-05,Economic Times,"Bitcoin is currently priced below $57,000, indicating a period of consolidation before any significant upward movement. However, there's optimism for the near future as the October-December quarter historically favors Bitcoin's performance. If you have available funds, consider gradually investing in promising assets to take advantage of potential gains.

August was a disappointing month for crypto assets. In a typically positive/green month, Bitcoin was down 8.6%. As we head into September, a strong bearish outlook prevails in the market. Given September is usually a red month, traders are cautious about taking long positions in the current scenario. However, new opportunities arise when the market is bearish. Crypto should emerge out of macroeconomic and inflation-related fears in September with the possibility of US interest rate cuts.

Currently, Bitcoin is trading below $57,000 and looks to consolidate into a strong position before bullish action ensues. The good news is that additional pain will be short-lived as the October-December quarter is usually exceptional for the asset class. If you have spare cash to deploy, consider cost-averaging your buys into some of the promising assets.

In this article, we will explore some emerging narratives and identify potential crypto gems that could yield good returns in the coming months. Remember, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and it's crucial to conduct your research and understand the risks associated with each investment.

Layer 1 forms the backbone of Web3. Blockchains that deliver speed at scale have been sought after by Web3 enthusiasts for many use cases. We present three such solutions today.

Avalanche (AVAX), a Layer-1 blockchain aiming to solve Ethereum's scalability issues, has attracted significant attention with recent partnerships with major gaming projects. Backed by prominent investors and boasting high transaction speeds and low fees, AVAX holds strong potential. Last month, AVAX just had a huge token unlock of 9.5 million. It is set up to be bullish for some time as upcoming unlocks are comparatively small. AVAX is backed by Pantera Capital, a16z, and Coinbase Ventures. With a market cap of $8.6 billion, AVAX has a potential to do 6-8x over 12 months.

Aptos (APT) is layer 1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain that employs a novel smart contract programming language called Move to bring mainstream adoption to Web3. With a substantial backing (a16z, Coinbase, Binance etc) and a growing DeFi TVL, APT is worth considering. It's notable that its DeFi TVL has grown by 375% in a year to $573 million. With a market cap of nearly $3 billion, APT has potential to do a 8-10x over 12 months.

The XDC Network (XDC) is a blockchain developed to support trade finance and the tokenization of RWAs. A highly optimized, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, XDC Network reaches consensus through a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) mechanism. Its market cap is comparatively low ($390 million) and has room to grow 8-12x over 12 months.

Polygon (POL) is one of the leading layer 2 solutions for Ethereum and is anticipating a big upgrade to its ecosystem this week. It's introducing a AggLayer, which can solve the fragmented liquidity across many blockchains. As a first step towards this transformation, MATIC token is being migrated to POL token. This upgrade, coupled with its strong position as a leading Ethereum Layer-2 solution, makes POL a compelling prospect. MATIC has fallen out of top 20 crypto assets recently. However, we anticipate POL make a strong comeback. With a current market cap of $3.8 billion, POL can potentially do a 7-10x over next 12 months.

Myria (MYRIA) is building an L2 Gaming ecosystem to scale NFTs, blockchain gaming and more. It has partnered AB De Villiers and has launched a game called 360 Cricket. It has also partnered Neo Tokyo, a popular online community of Web3 founders. MYRIA is an ERC-20 utility token used for transactions on Myria's Layer 2 scaling protocol. It claims to be lightning fast, with zero gas fees. However, token unlocks until 2027 can be a point of concern for market participants. MYRIA, with a market cap below $50 million, is a high-risk, high-reward play. It can potentially do a 10-12x over 12 months.

The SUN token powers SunSwap, Tron's top DEX platform with a TVL close to $800 million and a daily volume of $200 million. It is collecting over $300,000in fees daily. The numbers indicate the growing Tron ecosystem. SUN has a buyback and burn mechanism, which can lead to reduced supply and potentially higher prices in the future. Concerns can be around Tron's adoption over the long term. With a market cap of $280 million, SUN can potentially do an 8-12x over 12 months.

It is prudent to pivot a majority of your crypto portfolio to the safest assets especially if a pullback occurs - Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). They are proven to enable adoption by new investors in the space. Their returns will be less significant (3-6x) but they drive the trend and volume in crypto.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,737.79, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Ethereum launched in 2015 and is the most popular altcoin. Along with bitcoin, it has become one of the most recognizable forms of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum price history

*The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $315.82 billion. It's up 67% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 71% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $89.91 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $301 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $296 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based platform. It facilitates secure financial transactions. The network's native token is ether.

Bitcoin also uses blockchain technology. But it operates differently. Ethereum has a programmable blockchain that offers users additional utility via smart contracts. Smart contracts run automatically when certain conditions are met.

Many users prefer ethereum's decentralized network because it doesn't rely on Big Tech companies. The network of small, private computers doesn't use cloud servers owned by Google or Amazon.

Ethereum's blockchain is used for decentralized finance, gaming, socializing and gambling. Nonfungible tokens, one-of-a-kind digital collectibles, also exist on the blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique digital assets, such as works of art, songs and videos.

Users pay ethereum gas fees to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. They're similar to highway tolls.

Gas fees are paid in gwei, a unit representing one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,737.79.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 140% year over year, compared to a 67% gain for ethereum.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.0980392156862746

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, was $2,522.45 as of 8 a.m. ET. The crypto's highest intraday price in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

Although ethereum is not the first altcoin, it's the most popular and successful. The cryptocurrency was launched in 2015. Its blockchain has generated tremendous growth and returns over the past nine years.

Ethereum prices

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a market capitalization of $307.43 billion. It's up 47% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market capitalization of $307.43 billion is second to bitcoin's. It's similar to some major blue-chip stocks. These include the Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $298 billion.

ETH is a popular choice among crypto investors. Together with bitcoin, it makes up 71% of the crypto market.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network created to facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions. The network's native cryptocurrency is ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum's programmable blockchain allows users to securely verify and execute code, including smart contracts and decentralized applications. Smart contracts on the ethereum network are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when certain predetermined conditions are met.

The ethereum network's decentralized nature allows developers to run programs without relying on Big Tech companies or other third parties. Rather than running software on cloud servers housed in massive data centers owned by Google, ethereum users can run applications by leveraging ethereum's large network of small, private computers.

Applications on the ethereum blockchain include gaming, socializing, gambling and decentralized finance options. The ethereum blockchain is also home to the world's most significant nonfungible tokens. NFTs are unique digital creations representing ownership of digital property, such as a work of art, song or video.

Ethereum gas price

Ethereum gas is the fee network users pay to process transactions or use smart contracts on the network. Gas fees are akin to highway tolls. Users pay these fees to use the ethereum blockchain.

The unit of measurement for gas fees is gwei. One gwei equals one billionth of one ETH.

Ethereum launched in July 2015 and hit its all-time low soon after. In October 2015, ETH traded for just 42 cents.

Cryptocurrency rose in popularity in 2017. In January 2018, ETH reached $1,000 for the first time. It peaked at about $1,300 a couple of weeks later.

The announcement of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group helped drive that 2017 surge. But when enthusiasm waned in 2018, prices dropped. That led to a crypto winter.

Prices rose again in 2020. This time, COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns likely gave ethereum a boost. Thanks to government stimulus checks and low interest rates, many Americans put their cash into crypto.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum prices neared $5,000 in late 2021, reaching $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But rising interest rates cooled crypto markets in 2022. High-profile bankruptcies also hit the industry, most notably crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The price of ETH fell below $900 that year.

But the crypto bounced back. Prices have been on the rise in 2023 and 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January 2024.

The first U.S. ether spot ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. The funds come from Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock and more. They can be found on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,522.45.

Ethereum price vs. bitcoin price

Ethereum launched in 2015. Both ethereum and bitcoin have been spectacular investments since then.

The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in early 2024 has reversed the performance gap between the two cryptos. BTC is up 120% and ETH is up 47% year over year.

You might be more comfortable using online brokerages that support cryptocurrency trading, such as Interactive Brokers, Webull, and Robinhood.

Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal have options for buying ETH. Cryptocurrency ATMs also allow for direct purchases.

Private keys protect these digital wallets. The person with the private key controls the wallet's contents.

Ethereum wallets come in different forms. Some are hardware wallets that look like USB sticks. Others are software wallet apps on smartphones, tablets or computers. Wallets can also be hot or cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience. Cold wallets aren't connected to the internet and are generally considered more secure.

Approved by the SEC in late 2023, ethereum futures ETFs are relatively new. They don't invest directly. Rather, they hold futures contracts. The Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) are the three leading ethereum futures ETFs.

Ether spot ETFs, which include the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), debuted in July 2024.

The approval of bitcoin and ether spot ETFs may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1607843137254903

When making investments in cryptocurrencies, the timing of making such an investment is key. Since technology keeps on changing, the markets evolve or new trends come into place; some of the cryptocurrencies become good candidates to buy immediately with the aim of making some profit out of it. As the bitcoin market continues to change with Bitcoin becoming much more popular and more competing digital currencies appearing, it becomes key to understand which digital currencies will be popular by 2024. This article will assist you in rooting for the most promising coins right now according to the strengths of the crypto market.

The potential returns on investing in cryptocurrencies are evident, but one has to appreciate the challenges, more so on volatility in the market structure. That said, investors can point towards several important factors that are critical when weighing whether or not a cryptocurrency is a good buy at a specific moment:

Rising asset value and growth in asset volume is an indication of confidence from investors. When there is continuous upward movement then there is strong backing from investors in the market with immediate profits to be made.

Investors prefer waiting in long queues to put their money into projects where there is a new technology launched or decisive technology updates such as improved scalability and more security. New improvements imply that growth is expected even in the future.

Certain events like partnerships, protocol upgrades, or the coin being listed on exchanges are followed by price increases. There is an opportunity for investors to take advantage of such anticipated price rises before such events happen.

Cryptocurrencies that offer simple and effective solutions to existing problems fill in the gap much quicker. A well-defined use case guarantees the success of the project for a very long period of time.

Paying attention to community and developer engagement is needed to stay positive and grow despite the competition being faced in the market.

Projects with this sort of market operate normally under good regulations, while projects under no such regulations become risky. Keeping track of any such developments is needful.

Cryptocurrencies that can be used on applications like payment systems or DeFi are more likely to achieve higher rates of adoption and consequently long-term viability.

Institutions working on solid projects with good partnerships are more durable, have wider outreach and get more adoption.

Under this feature, investors will concede that most coins, which were able to recover after the intense summer crash or grow continuously, are more valuable investments and suggest strong management and innovation of the projects.

Below, we will make a case for each of these cryptocurrencies, outlining the reasons for the anticipated appreciation throughout 2024. Among other things, the discussion will include their performance and position in the market, technological aspects and future news that may boost their popularity.

Bitcoin is the first popularised cryptocurrency. Its current market valuation is 1.2 trillion US dollars. As a form of digital currency that works in a decentralized manner, bitcoin is well-known as a media of exchange or as a store of value, often inclusively described as 'digital gold.' The impressive development of Bitcoin is aided by the willingness of both institutional and retail investors.

Why It's a Good Buy: Investors still find Bitcoin to be the best and the most accepted digital asset. In 2024, this craving will be enshrined by the forthcoming halving event, which is going to cut the state's subsidy of the Block and increase the value of Bitcoin. Statistically, there has been a general price surge of Bitcoin after halving in the past. '' Additionally, Bitcoin is becoming more and more integrated into traditional financial networks like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and payment systems and thus its growth perspective is only enhanced.

Potential Risks: Even with these advantages, Bitcoin is not a safe investment. The price is very erratic and subject to depreciation for various reasons including but not limited to regulation and changes in the market. In addition, there are concerns about the energy efficiency of Bitcoin that some critics have pointed out which may spark regulation.

Ethereum, currently the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market creation, tops the chart in terms of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Having a market cap of ‪289.17 B‬ USD billion, Ethereum has put itself on the map as one of the most fundamental building blocks of the blockchain structure.

Why It's a good buy: Anyone who keeps track of Ethereum and isn't particularly interested in its application already knows that the shift of Ethereum from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), or Ethereum 2.0, is a big deal. This boost improves just about everything including the scalability, security and energy efficiency of the network making it easier for development and investments. Ethereum's ecosystem remains to grow in 2024, with DeFi and NFTs creating demand for ETH.

Potential risks: As a smart contract platform, Ethereum is at risk of competition from other players like Solana and Cardano which offer cheaper fees and faster transaction quality. Also, Ethereum's price and its use could be affected by the delays in Ethereum 2.0's implementation as well as any unexpected problems that may occur along the way.

Solana is a fast and cost-effective blockchain that has high transaction processing power. As of writing, Solana's market cap is about $60 billion and from deep within has managed to appeal to developers and investors who wish to invest in alternatives to Ethereum.

Why It's a Good Buy: Due to the combination of the 'Proof of History and Proof of Stake' consensus mechanism, Solana can carry out thousands of transactions every second. There has been great attraction of dApps, DeFi projects, and NFTs to the Solana ecosystem because of this scalability. In 2024, however, this growth of Solana's user experience and developer's tools will enable it capture new markets.

Potential Risks: There is also the problem of the network being unavailable for some time which has happened with Solana in the past which brings concern to the trust factor. Since it is a new entrant, there are ongoing disruptive strategies that it must engage, to be at the fore of competition against other established blockchains such as Ethereum.

Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that seeks sustainability, scalability, and interoperability. A market cap of around $11.52 billion places Cardano in the spotlight for its academic-driven development and community engagement.

Why It's a Good Buy: There is no doubt that the nature of Cardano, which is peer-reviewed and assembles formal verification on its platform, is powerful. The upcoming Hydra upgrade in 2024 which is expected to address the issue of scalability on Cardano, particularly in the number of users and developers is expected to be in hot demand. Lastly, the capability of Cardano in developing countries, offering blockchain-native applications is quite a refreshing concept.

Potential Risks: Owing to this focus on planning, collecting an appropriate amount of evidence through testing and research before development can result in Cardano experiencing slow growth. Even though this approach guarantees security and reliability, it also means that few upcoming technologies might be adopted late in the day, because Cardano will take too long.

Polkadot is intended for the integration of all existing and future blockchains. Currently valued at approximately $5.7 billion in market cap, Polkadot is leading the efforts for blockchain evolution where interoperability and scalability are key requirements.

Why It's a Good Buy: The architecture of Polkadot is advantageous as it has a central relay chain and many accompanying parachains thus blockchains can communicate with one another. This feature is very important for decentralized finance and cross-chain applications in the future. In 2024 the growing ecosystem of parachains and widening usability of Polkadot make it a tough one for prolonged investment.

Potential Risks: One of the risks regards the possibility of Polkadot achieving success is the expansion of its parachains. Further backlogs or glitches in technology within this front could undermine its growth. Also, there are rising challenges from other interoperability markets like the Cosmos project which is a threat to its position.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network whose core function is to provide smart contracts with external information. It has emerged as critical by the Total Market Cap of around $6.2 billion of the DeFi space thanks to the reliable provision of data.

Why It's a Good Buy: The role played by Chainlink in the DeFi sector can never be downplayed. As the DeFi industry continues to evolve, the requisite need for trustworthy oracles such as Chainlink will only be necessary. Chainlink will have room for more growth in 2024 tapping the ultimate evolution of cross-chain, data feed and decentralized identity.

Potential Risks: The major risk faced by Chainlink is the competition from newer Oracle services. Chainlink is perhaps the most widely used in the market today; however, changes in rival companies could change that. Also, the broader cryptocurrency market's performance could impact Chainlink's adoption and price.

Avalanche is an ecosystem that facilitates the development of Dapps and carries out enterprise blockchain solutions in a single highly scalable interoperable system. Within less than a year of inception, Avalanche has a focus on market capitalization of about $20 billion.

Why It's a Good Buy: Its consensus protocol enables it to be able to handle transactions in less than one second making it one of the fastest if not the fastest in the Blockchain space. In the year 2024, with the growing ecosystem that includes DeFi projects, NFTs and enterprise solutions, Avalanche will be a good investment option. The platform is also very flexible as it supports both decentralized and centralized blockchains.

Potential Risks: Avalanche must see off competition from Solana, Ethereum and other upcoming scalable blockchains. Also, any technical technical and security challenges and weaknesses might affect Avalanche's reputation and adoption.

Ripple is a digital payment protocol that facilitates instant and cheap transfers of money internationally. It is the 3rd largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $31.12B market cap, and relatively is an active cryptocurrency in payment systems.

Why It's a Good Buy: Ripple faced several issues in the SEC Courtroom which created caution toward XRP but at the same time presented leveraged opportunities for risk-oriented traders. If Ripple manages to prevail with their disputes, there is a huge possibility of an XRP spike in price. Moreover, the company continues building its presence in the market through partnerships with various financial institutions.

Potential Risks: The most important risk for the XRP remains the court case against the SEC. A negative outcome would trigger potential ranging from penalties to limitations of operations and issues to even delisting from leading exchange platforms. Furthermore, a threat of change is presented by emerging digital payment systems competing against XRP such as Stellar.

Polygon is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that caters to the need for faster transactions and lower fees. It has a market cap of approximately $1.79B thus making it an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem.

Why It's a Good Buy: The rapidly growing demand for DeFi and NFTs as well as the ever-emerging soft infrastructure demands Polygon's proportion in Ethereum networking, as a scaling solution. In 2024, Polygon aims to break into new markets including gaming and enterprise solutions, which sets the company up for more growth. It acts as a good draw for both the developers and the users due to reasonably priced cautious charges and rapid transactions.

Potential Risks: Since Polygon is essentially bolted onto Ethereum, any problems or delays in the Ethereum development roadmap fetters also Polygon's performance. Besides that, it has competition from other layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism that pose a threat to Polygon dominance.

Cosmos is an interesting project as it is essentially a network of multiple blockchains, which are independent but capable of interoperating with one another. Holding approximately 1.5 billion dollars in total market cap, Cosmos seeks to lead the sector of multi-blockchain network technology.

Why It's a Good Buy: The inter-chain Nature of Cosmos will be its bargaining tool with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol which will enhance data and assets transfer from one blockchain to another. Such a feature would be much needed in the decentralized finance of tomorrow's world as well as in future applications that might integrate different chains. In 2024, Cosmos's growing ecosystem and the increasing adoption of its IBC protocol make it a strong candidate for investment.

Potential Risks: The success of Cosmos fundamentally resides in the user acceptance of its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and the development of its ecosystem. Any stagnation or technical difficulties in these aspects may limit its expansion. Besides, there are other interoperability solutions available on the market, such as Polkadot, causing some competition.

However tempting the idea of investing in cryptocurrency may be, there are some factors that ought to be put into consideration before venturing into such investments:

Cryptocurrencies are prone to heavy price fluctuations. Formulating a long-term plan aids in reducing the risk of making rash decisions based on market fluctuations in the near future.

One should carefully watch the prevailing affairs since the changing laws, taxes, or policies in one area can be felt in the cryptocurrency market.

Determine the purpose, uniqueness, builders, and the public around the cryptocurrency in question and assess its feasibility of mass adoption.

Investments should be carried out through trusted exchanges and digital currency hardware wallets where hacking, fraud, and phishing should be defended against.

Invest in different altcoins in order to minimise risk and increase the chances of returns.

Just like any other asset, however, cryptocurrencies can also face the challenge of liquidity. Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to be highly liquid, making it easier to trade, but small coins possess lower liquidity which provides a strain when the market fluctuates.

One should prefer projects where management is more open and responsive, roadmaps and other necessary reimbursement steps are constantly being updated, and preventive measures are employed.

Sustained growth in some cryptocurrencies is easier due to a large number of users who have embraced the system as well as a network effect.

There are external economic conditions like price shifts or the level of progress in the cryptocurrency market that affect the demand as well as the performance of a particular cryptocurrency.

Analyze the risks associated with the technology provision, for example, potential flaws, blockages, and other factors that may lead to technology becoming outdated.

A vigorous, engaged community and healthy ecosystem is crucial for a cryptocurrency's innovation and growth for a long period of time.

Due to the fact that market movements are closely related to the impact of the investor's intention, it is likely that market sentiments will be closely monitored in order to anticipate movements and make suitable decisions.

Determining the precise criteria of one's entry and exit enables discipline in investing and promotes adequate return on every investment made.

Investing in Cryptocurrencies can be quite an interesting and tough investment option. The Cryptocurrencies listed in this article are quite promising for the year 2024, hence their immediate investment. However, it is necessary to carry out adequate due diligence as well as risk assessment for any of the investments. Limiting oneself to knowledge only and making strategic movement would avail one of the opportunities provided in the highly volatile Crypto market and this ensures good returns.",https://150601093.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/133-1-scaled.jpg,0.4352941176470588
Why White Label Crypto Exchanges are the Future of Trading,https://marketbusinessnews.com/?p=391229,2024-08-27,Market Business News,"In today's developing world, robust and scalable trading platforms are in higher demand as a result of the crypto market's massive expansion. But creating a cryptocurrency exchange from the ground up takes a lot of time, money, and technological know-how. A white label crypto exchange can be a game-changer in this situation.

White label exchanges are swiftly taking over as the go-to option for business owners and entrepreneurs wishing to enter the cryptocurrency trading market since they provide a ready-made solution that can be tailored to match the particular requirements of organizations. We will look at why white label crypto exchanges are going to be the way that trading is done in the future in this blog, as well as how they are changing the market for digital assets.

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrency exchanges have undergone substantial development. The complex characteristics that contemporary traders want were absent from the primitive markets of the past. The technology underlying exchanges developed together with the digital currency sector. Traders now need platforms that are user-friendly, dependable, and safe while providing a large selection of digital assets.

But creating a crypto exchange from scratch is no easy task. It needs a lot of coding, strict security measures, and continuous maintenance. There is also the added problem of complying with international regulations, which is getting more difficult. White label cryptocurrency exchange software development is the answer for a lot of companies.

A white label crypto exchange is a ready-made, adaptable trading platform that enables companies to quickly start their own cryptocurrency exchange. These platforms have all the necessary functions, such as wallets, trading engines, user management, and security measures. The main benefit of a white label digital currency exchange is that it can be customized to fit any size company's demands, be it a start-up or an established one.

Businesses can save time and money by using a white label cryptocurrency exchange, all while providing a state-of-the-art trading platform. This strategy is especially appealing to companies that wish to instantly enter the cryptocurrency space without having to deal with the difficulties of building a platform from the ground up.

The speed at which a white label exchange can be created is one of its biggest benefits. Creating a cryptocurrency exchange from scratch can take several months or even years. On the other hand, a white label crypto exchange can be operational within a few weeks. This speedy response enables companies to seize market possibilities right away.

The cost of starting from scratch to develop a crypto exchange is high. A group of developers, security specialists, and compliance officers are needed. A white label cryptocurrency exchange, on the other hand, drastically lowers the entry barrier. For many businesses, it's a more cost-effective solution because they only have to pay for the platform's customization and license.

A crypto exchange white label platform provides a great level of customization. Companies can modify the platform's functionality, UI, and design to better suit their target market's demands and align with their own brand. Because of this adaptability, businesses can easily stand out in a congested market.

Security for any crypto exchange is of utmost importance. Typically, a white label software development company for cryptocurrency exchanges has vast expertise in safeguarding trading platforms. To defend against cyberattacks, they put strong security measures in place, such as encryption, two-factor authentication, and frequent security assessments.

One of the biggest challenges facing any cryptocurrency exchange is navigating the intricate web of international laws. White label cryptocurrency exchange development firms are knowledgeable about compliance specifications and frequently offer integrated tools to support organizations in adhering to national and international legal standards.

As the market for cryptocurrencies expands, so do the demands on trading platforms. Scalable design features in a white label digital asset exchange enable companies to grow as needed. For businesses that hope to gradually increase their user base and transaction volume, this scalability is essential.

Digital assets are leading the way in the rapid transformation of the financial sector. As cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted, a strong, flexible, and user-focused infrastructure is needed to support this new financial environment. White label exchanges, which provide solutions that are both scalable and adaptable to meet the needs of many market participants, are starting to emerge as the foundation of this infrastructure. Here's a closer look at the reasons why these platforms may dominate trade in the future.

With new assets being created and traded every day, the cryptocurrency industry is expanding rapidly. Institutional and retail investors alike are searching for solutions that can quickly and reliably support this expanding ecosystem. White label cryptocurrency exchanges offer the flexibility required to meet consumer demand. Because these platforms can be swiftly put into use, organizations can gain market share without having to wait for traditional development to take its course. Moreover, they can be quickly expanded to handle spikes in user activity, guaranteeing that companies stay competitive and adaptable to changing market conditions.

The domain of digital assets is marked by constant innovation, as seen by the persistent transformation of the environment by technologies like smart contracts, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). The best white label cryptocurrency exchange allows you to effectively integrate these developing technologies. White label exchanges are easily modified to integrate new features, asset kinds, and trading procedures, in contrast to rigid, custom-built systems. Businesses can stay ahead of the curve and provide innovative services that draw and keep customers thanks to this flexibility.

Trading in cryptocurrencies is by its very nature international, although regional differences in the regulatory landscape are notable. White label digital currency exchanges come with built-in features that cater to the regulatory needs of many markets and are made to function in several countries. The platform's capacity to be localized for particular locations further expands its worldwide reach. With white label crypto exchanges, companies may customize their offers to cater to a wide range of user bases through features like language customisation, integration with local payment systems, and adherence to regional compliance norms. Businesses looking to increase their market share internationally must be able to function on a global scale while meeting local demands.

The intricacy of creating and managing a cryptocurrency exchange might draw focus and resources away from a business's primary goals. Businesses may concentrate on what they do best, such as marketing, client acquisition, or product creation, by utilizing a cryptocurrency white label exchange. By assigning the technical components of the platform to professionals, white label companies can ensure that their exchange is feature-rich, compliant, and safe without having to invest in in-house development. This emphasis on core activities results in more efficient operations and improved overall business success.

Making a distinctive impression is essential to standing out in the crowded crypto market. White label cryptocurrency exchanges give companies an opportunity to experiment and develop original customer experiences. As an illustration, businesses can launch exclusive trading pairs, use cutting-edge analytics and trading instruments, or provide exclusive loyalty and reward schemes. Furthermore, the user interface can be tailored to the brand's identity, giving customers a consistent and memorable experience. This degree of personalization is necessary for companies trying to find their place in an already crowded market.

The cryptocurrency business has been beset by security lapses and hacking attacks, which have undermined confidence in certain trading platforms. Nonetheless, white label crypto exchange development firms place a high priority on security in their products. They put in place strong safeguards like encrypted data storage, two-factor authentication, and multi-signature wallets. Businesses may develop trust with their users by making sure the platform is secure, which is essential for long-term success. In addition, a lot of white label exchanges go through frequent security assessments and upgrades to make sure they remain safe from emerging online threats.

Successful companies have the capacity to grow, especially in the crypto exchange market. Scalability is a key consideration in the design of white label digital asset exchanges, which enable companies to begin small and expand as their user base and trading volume rise. The infrastructure of the platform is also scalable, allowing it to accommodate large transaction volumes and easily incorporate new technologies as they become available. A scalable platform is a major competitive advantage in a market with tremendous growth potential.

The ability to quickly build a trading platform can give a significant advantage in the crypto market. White label cryptocurrency exchange software development shortens the time to market significantly, enabling companies to seize opportunities and trends as they present themselves. White label exchanges give companies the flexibility to react quickly when introducing new asset pairs or expanding into new markets. This can be crucial as it gives them an edge over others.

With the rise of decentralized protocols, traditional intermediaries such as banks will give way to decentralized financial systems. DeFi platforms can be integrated by white label cryptocurrency exchanges to provide users with decentralized loan, staking, and trading services. The exchange is positioned as a progressive platform that follows the most recent developments in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to this integration, which also expands the range of services it offers.

The price of ethereum, or 1 ETH, traded at $2,511.61, as of 8 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that ethereum reached in the past year was $4,088.00 on March 12, 2024.

While not the first altcoin, ethereum is among the best-known. The cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in its blockchain and value since its 2015 launch.

Ethereum prices

The chart pulls data as of 8 a.m. ET daily and doesn't display intraday highs or lows.

Ethereum's 52-week intraday high was on March 12, 2024, trading at $4,088.00 per ETH. Its 52-week intraday low was $1,520.00 on Oct. 12, 2023.

The leading altcoin has shifted global financial markets and amassed a global market capitalization of $302.41 billion. ETH is currently up 47% year over year.

Ethereum market cap

Ethereum's market cap is second to bitcoin's. Bitcoin and ethereum make up 71% of the crypto market. The third-largest crypto is Solana. Its market cap is $80.89 billion.

Ethereum's market cap is similar to that of major blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Co. (KO) at $309 billion and Merck & Co. (MRK) at $298 billion.

What is ethereum? And how does ethereum work?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network that facilitates secure, decentralized financial transactions. Its native crypto is ether.

Its programmable blockchain lets users securely verify and execute code using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This differs from bitcoin, which has a limited capacity to run smart contracts. Smart contracts are software applications that run automatically on the blockchain when specific conditions are met.

By operating on a decentralized network, ethereum helps users avoid third parties. This could appeal to you if you don't want to rely on Big Tech companies. Instead of running software on Google's servers, for example, you can leverage ethereum's network.

It can run a variety of applications for socializing, gaming, gambling and decentralized finance. The network also houses nonfungible tokens, which represent ownership of unique digital assets.

Ethereum gas price

The ethereum network isn't free to use. Users must pay gas fees, similar to highway tolls, which support its operation. Gas fees fluctuate based on supply and demand for transactions.

Gas fees are expressed as gwei. One gwei represents one billionth of one ether.

Ethereum launched in July 2015. Not long after, it hit its all-time low of 42 cents in October 2015.

But that didn't last long. Trading picked up sharply in 2017. ETH hit $1,000 for the first time in January 2018. Just two weeks later, it reached a new peak of $1,300.

CME Group's announcement that it would offer bitcoin futures contracts drove the rally. But enthusiasm ebbed in 2018. That year saw the start of a bear market, often referred to as a ""crypto winter.""

2020 brought another boom. The COVID-19 pandemic likely played a major role. The distribution of stimulus funds and low interest rates meant many Americans had money to speculate.

Ethereum prices 2021-2024

Ethereum nearly cracked $5,000 at the end of 2021, hitting $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021. But interest rate increases gave investors alternatives, resulting in another cooling of the market. High-profile bankruptcies, including leading cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November 2022, also hit the industry. ETH fell under $900 that year.

But 2023 brought a new rally and more optimism from investors. That carried into 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving several bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January.

Ether spot ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, 2024. The funds come from BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, to name a few. They can be found on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange.

In early August 2024, ethereum prices plummeted after a widespread crypto sell-off hit global markets. Prices plunged from well above the $3,000 threshold on Aug. 3 to less than $2,500 on Aug. 4. Currently, ETH trades at $2,511.61.

Bitcoin price vs. ethereum price

Since ethereum's launch in 2015, there's no question that bitcoin and ETH have been spectacular investments.

The past year's enthusiasm for bitcoin spot ETFs has reversed the performance gap between the two major cryptos. The price of bitcoin is up 118% year over year, compared to a 47% gain for ethereum.

You can buy ethereum using popular payment apps like Venmo and PayPal. And you can purchase it directly through physical cryptocurrency ATMs.

How to store ethereum

To store ethereum, you must have a crypto wallet. This functions like a digital version of a physical wallet used for paper money.

You have a private key to ensure that only you can access what's inside. The owner of a wallet's private key controls its contents.

An ethereum wallet can be a hardware wallet resembling a USB stick. Or it can be a software wallet app storing ETH on a smartphone or another device. A wallet is considered hot if it's connected to the internet and cold if it isn't. A cold wallet offers more safety and security but less convenience.

Ethereum ETFs

Ethereum funds allow investors to speculate on the ethereum market without buying ethereum directly.

The first wave of ethereum futures ETFs dropped in late 2023. They hold futures contracts rather than investing in ethereum directly. Leading options include the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).

Ether spot ETFs debuted in July 2024. They include the Grayscale ethereum trust (ETHE).

Fidelity ethereum fund (FETH) and iShares ethereum trust (ETHA). Their approval may indicate a softening toward some cryptos in their legal fights.",https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/images/uploads/2024/03/26101320/GettyImages-951165896-scaled-e1711462456367.jpg,0.1058823529411765

Top Cryptocurrencies: An In-Depth Analysis of the Market Leaders,https://techbullion.com/top-cryptocurrencies-an-in-depth-analysis-of-the-market-leaders/,2024-09-01,TechBullion,"Since Bitcoin was made in 2009, the universe of advanced monetary forms has grown enormously. At its commencement, it was an exclusive, misread sort of innovation. Nowadays its presence is felt deeply all over the world. From a decentralized point of view, top cryptocurrency offer security that is both embedded and transparent-pure information seed is directly to the value form in this method of transaction. Many digital currencies exist among which some have emerged as market leaders. These coins are referred to as top cryptocurrency. In this article, we will take a look at these leading top cryptocurrency, examining where they came from, what technological basis lurks beneath the surface, how they have performed on the market thus far, and how-if at all-they fit into our broader financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer of Top Cryptocurrency

Bitcoin, the first and most well-known of all top cryptocurrencies, was launched by an unknown person or team that was named in the former year after its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. It first enabled people to see that blockchain technology could become a decentralized network of computers, all keeping their records Bitcoin's standalone-based attributes are its scarcity, which leads to a maximum supply limit of 21 million coins, and that it is decentralized, in other words, immune from censorship and government control.

Bitcoin's position in the top cryptocurrency market today is unassailable. It consistently holds by far the largest market capitalization, often taking over 40% of the whole crypto market. What drives up the price? Factors such as institutional adoption, conditions on a large scale that favor monetary growth, and ""digital gold"" status. Bitcoin锦 is viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic instability and has thus become very popular among investors as an investment asset with which to store their savings But Bitcoin's scalability problems and energy consumption have generated

Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation of Decentralized Applications

In 2015, Ethereum was sent off by a group headed by Ethereum maker and engineer Vitalik Buterin. In 2015 the cost of Ethereum, began by a team headed by Ethereum maker and engineer Vitalik Buterin, zoomed to $137 billion. Ethereum isn't Bitcoin, which is a computerized cash. Then again, Ethereum is a blockchain stage involving a brilliant agreement mechanism. Ethereum is a stage that works on shrewd agreements. Smart contracts are automatically executing contracts, and the agreement terms between buyer and seller are directly written into code. With it users pay for transaction fees on the network or use it as a substitute currency to provide computational services.

Ether (ETH) is the currency of Ethereum. With this currency, users can pay for transactions on the Ethereum network or use it to purchase computational services. Ether will be the most valuable money in this system. The Ethereum platform is the linchpin of the bursting open decentralized finance sector (DeFi), a source of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and initial coin offerings. The incredible diversity and openness mean that all segments of society have been attracted to it: developers, enterprises, and investors are involved here, which makes this platform a cornerstone for today's top cryptocurrency.

Nevertheless, Ethereum has encountered obstacles over scalability and high gas fees that have especially worsened during network congestion periods. To address these problems, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 will see a shift from proof-of-work (PoW) and the associated power consumption for computers running nodes of the network towards proof-of-stake (PoS). This is intended to raise capacity on its part while reducing energy expenditure.

Binance Coin (BNB): The Utility Token with Multiple Use Cases

It's an original project that pairs the native top cryptocurrency of Binance, one of the world's biggest exchanges, with the asset. The original BNB was an ERC-20 token on Ethereum's blockchain that later moved over to Binance Chain, where it now resides.BNB was developed as a utility token that would provide users with discounts on trading fees within the Binance ecosystem.

Over the years BNB has taken on more and more roles. Now it is both the currency used to purchase lottery tickets at Launchpad (Binance's platform for token sales) and a means of making payments for goods or services from many businesses in China. Plus, you can use it to book hotel accommodations too. Binance has also introduced a mechanism for burning BNB tokens every quarter. That means some BNB is taken out of circulation permanently, thus reducing the supply and theoretically increasing its value. The success of BNB At the same time is inseparable from Binance's overall expanse and many other startup projects; Binance Smart Chain, like Ethereum with its virtual machine, supports smart contracts on its blockchains for example. (EVM). BSC has become popular for Dapp developers, particularly those working in DeFi applications, providing a low-cost alternative to Ethereum. This only contributes to BNB's rally.

Cardano (ADA): The Blockchain with a Scientific Approach

In aiming to address the scalability, interoperability, and sustainability that legacy blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have meanwhile fallen into, Cardano ventures onto this stage. Cardano was coordinated by Charles Hoskinson, among Ethereum's co-founders. It relied on peer-reviewed positioning theory and formal verification methods to ensure the safety and efficiency of its protocol and was developed with a research-led approach. ADA, Cardano's native top cryptocurrency, is used in the platform's governance, as well as for staking. Energy efficiency and security are both values embedded in the Ouroboros protocol which forms a consensus mechanism for the network's proof of stake.

Cardano presents a phase-in approach about how it is developing throughout every stage in the whole platform such as decentralization, smart contracts, and scalability. Interoperability is one of Cardano's key principles: because it can communicate not only with other blockchains but also classical financial systems, this provides a convenient means for enterprises as well as governments to utilize distributed ledger technology in their daily operations. While the Cardano ecosystem is still in an early stage, as development continues it is starting to see more and more signs of becoming a major force in the world of top cryptocurrencies

Solana (SOL): The High-Performance Blockchain

Starting transactions is one of the fastest ways of creating a scalable system due to its simple parser and high-speed messaging engine. Then, Anatoly Yakovenko launched Solana in 2020 with an eye for scalability in response systems that didn't offer themselves to all types or sizes of users. In Solana's architecture, the secret sauce is a mix of proof of stake and proof of history (PoH). That allows it to run thousands of transactions per second with very low latency. Sol is the spokesman of Solana-native top cryptocurrencies.

Its main purpose within the network serves to be as both a means of exchange (transaction fees) and a means of staking. Solana's scalability and low cost have already attracted an increasing number of projects to the platform, ranging from DeFi apps and NFTs to Web3 projects. The community around these is also growing fast. Moreover, recent higher-quality partnerships and collaborations give it additional weight to move into the space that Ethereum now occupies.

However, the rapid growth of Solana has not been without obstacles. Starting transactions is one of the fastest ways of creating a scalable system due to its simple parser and high-speed messaging engine.

Sol is the spokesman of Solana-native top cryptocurrencies.

Ripple (XRP): Bridging the Gap Between Traditional Finance and Blockchain

As Wave is a computerized installment convention and not a digital currency, a top decision for some individuals who need to send globally modest cash rapidly. Swell is not the same as other cryptographic forms of money that are overseen by decentralized networks. Instead of this, it works very closely with partner banks and financial institutions to speed up international fund transfers. The cryptographic money of Wave, XRP, isn't simply used to pay exchange expenses; it fills in as a significant monetary scaffold between various public monetary forms.

In today's world, many financial institutions worldwide have tried out Ripple's technology. It's also one of the most widely used blockchain payment solutions worldwide. However, Ripple faces significant regulatory challenges. One particular issue is in the United States, where a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) accuses it of issuing unlicensed securities through XRP.

Despite these challenges, Ripple continues to expand globally. In addition, the company targets emerging markets and areas with heavy remittance traffic. XRP's worth is firmly connected with the progress of Wave's installment organization and how capably it can address roadblocks that legislatures and controllers put in its manner.

Conclusion: The Evolving Landscape of Top Cryptocurrencies

The top cryptocurrency market is dynamic and evolving, it has always been like this. Upstart projects and products can pop up just out of nowhere. For instance, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Ripple represent some of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of capital and influence, the situation is anything different for batteries. Nor can Solana be forgotten in that regard.

Every crypto-currency has its strengths and difficulties and so does each offer opportunities for further future development. Investors and fans in top digital currency watch this space. It can change quickly because of technological breakthroughs or regulatory shifts, even with macroeconomic factors being added together. Today's top cryptocurrencies will not be those of tomorrow, but their impact on the market is beyond question. However, as the adoption of blockchain technology and digital money rages on, tomorrow's finance may well be shaped by problems encountered by these leading cryptos.

Numerous altcoins have extraordinary qualities and utilizations, Similar to tokens for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and coins that safeguard individual protection. Stablecoins: Cryptographic forms of money are fixed to a resource steady, like the US dollar, to diminish cost unpredictability. Models are Tie (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Emerging Cryptocurrencies: These are new, less well-known rights that may be happening to grow significantly but also contain a higher risk. Top Cryptocurrencies to Consider Bitcoin (BTC) Market Cap: Over $500 billion Launch Year: 2009 Use Case: Digital gold, store of value, decentralized currency

Whether it's ""digital gold"", a place to store wealth (outside the state's control), or a currency, Bitcoin still reigns as king. Today, with such a strong infrastructure already in place, it is accepted widely on many websites and is now a haven as far as assets go. It has become as famous for these traits as crude oil! Any investment in its neighboring coins should be weighted accordingly.

Bitcoin's selling points include the fact that it is highly decentralized, has a limited supply (only 21 million BTC will ever be mined), and is being recognized increasingly as an investment store similar to gold.

Many in the world of Defi have heard about Chainlink and Pyth Network, but there is a new protocol that has enshrined oracle directly into it's EVM Layer 1 Blockchain.

In this episode Ian Andrews (CMO, Chainalysis) speaks with Co-founder and CEO of Flare network, Hugo Philion.

Hugo shares his transition from hedge fund trading to blockchain and emphasizes the increasing need for decentralized data in an industry that heavily relies on information from data providers.

He breaks down Flare's architecture, offering cost-effective and secure data oracles, while being sure to differentiate their solution from existing systems that are vulnerable due to lack of decentralization and potential for collusion.

Hugo even explains how KYC and AML can be integrated by the developers building on Flare and how important regulation is to move the industry forward.

Ian:

Hi, everyone. Welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today, I'm joined by Hugo Philion who is co-founder at Flare and CEO of Flare Labs. Hugo, welcome to the show.

Hugo, I'm fascinated to learn about Flare Labs. It's a big project. Maybe since I'm guessing many of our listeners haven't heard of that before, we can start with just a brief overview of what you're building at Flare.

Hugo:

Absolutely. We are building what we think of as the best platform for data in the space. Flare, as a network, is an EVM layer one and it's the first network to have enshrined oracles integrated into the network itself. Those are oracles for prices, oracles for Web2 proofs, oracles for Web3 proofs. So this allows developers to build very feature-rich applications which get their data directly from the network in a highly decentralized and heavily secured way.

Ian:

It sounds really exciting. I want to dive in. I have so many questions about the technical details, but before we jump to that, tell us a little bit about your background. How did you find yourself in this world of blockchain and cryptocurrency?

Hugo:

I was a trader at a number of about two hedge funds. I was a trader of derivatives, primarily commodity derivatives. And I got to the point in my career with 2015, 2016, where I decided I really didn't want to continue in that career. I felt frustrated. I felt bored. I didn't like having to chase returns. It can be quite soul-destroying, especially when you don't feel like you're really building anything. I also didn't want to turn into mostly other people in my office, a sort of middle-aged alcoholic on their third wife. So I thought I'd leave and I did and I went back to university to study machine learning and that's where I met my two co-founders.

Ian:

How did you go from machine learning into the world of blockchain and crypto? That doesn't seem like necessarily a natural evolution, but I don't think anyone finds theirselves in this industry on a straight line path.

Hugo:

I was interested in statistics. I suppose my undergrad was primarily risk management and financial engineering, so I had a strong background in statistics, simulation modeling, that kind of stuff, very close to machine learning as a thing to go study machine learning was a very interesting and highly related aspect to, I suppose, my undergrad and a lot of the work I was doing whilst I was at a number of funds.

I didn't really want to go into machine learning AI after studying, because arguably at that time, and still to this day, AI and ML is really the preserve of very large tech organizations. Whilst crypto focuses on decentralizing banks and governments as their centralizing forces, really tech companies are also very heavy centralizing forces and not wanting to go back straight out of the frying pan and into the fire. I really didn't want to go directly to AI.

Secondly, really, at the time then and, again, I would say still to this day, despite the advances and the hype in AI, AI, as it is today, isn't that useful. I need to be careful what I say, but it's not that useful, that there are not that many mission-critical things that you would want to use AI for. It's still fairly early and there's a number of reasons for this. From siloing of useful data within large and medium-sized companies that can't and don't use the data to the complexities of being able to rely on the outputs of singular probabilistic models for mission-critical tasks.

I think the use of blockchain to improve aspects of AI is real and could have a fundamental effect on the usefulness of AI in the future. I certainly couldn't claim to be thinking about that back then, but I'm very glad I went into blockchain and not directly into AI.

Ian:

I think it's an astute observation, this idea of... I've spent a lot of time thinking about recently is sort of the verifiability of data in a world where the marginal cost to create real seeming data, whether that's video or audio or textual information, has sort of gone to zero. It starts to make sense to have systems that can verify authenticity and point of creation in a technically provable way. So I'm not sure if that was what you were alluding to or you have a different perspective on it that you'd like to share.

Hugo:

Well, I mean, I think we've been doing a lot of work on where blockchain and AI can intersect and we recently put out a paper called Consensus Learning, which is about collaborative AI. You have issues with probabilistic models that really they're just drawing inferences from probability distributions. And when you want to make a decision, a really, really important decision like, ""Does this person have cancer? Is this car about to crash? Do we need to take action,"" you want a very high degree of safety. Today's models don't necessarily provide that, and so we think that there's a form of collaborative machine learning or AI that can essentially mitigate the risks inherent in singular models. There's also a lot of other areas where AI can be used with blockchain, like you say, the verifiability of things. That's something, I think, we'll probably come onto in this chat, but I think those are potentially big use cases. But I think I see the biggest use case for blockchain and AI as blockchain being able to make AI fundamentally better.

Ian:

Super interesting. Connect that to what you're doing at Flare now. I'm always fascinated when I talk to someone that is launching a new chain, because I think the mass of people who interact with blockchains in some way sort of orbit around Bitcoin and Ethereum predominantly, and then a very long tail of layer one and layer two chains. Now we've got this kind of ecosystem of app-specific chains like what the folks at Celestia are doing. What led you and your co-founders down the path of saying, ""You know what? We need to create a new L1.""

Hugo:

Fundamentally, we think that data in the space is somewhat broken and we wanted to build a platform and we actually spent, I think, two years before we... As an organization, we spent two years, really, before we hit what we wanted to do. Really, from late 2017 to about 2019, we were kind of thinking, researching, not necessarily jumping onto, ""Let's build something today."" We were just really exploring the spaces. We come out of a non-crypto background and we wanted to make sure that we were thinking in the right direction and we fundamentally think that data is poorly served in the industry.

We wanted to build a layer one. Well, we wanted to build a platform where oracle's data are close to being as secure as the network itself. So we're building Flare and Flare's, really, the only major layer one with enshrined oracles and that is the oracle system is built into the network and derives its security in a similar manner to proof-of-stake. This means that a full validator set is needed if you want them staked, and so this rules out things like launching on Solana and rules out being an L2.

Even with these newer shared security models like icon layer, shared security would introduce to our mine's intolerable risks to the data side that are very, very hard to get over. From our perspective, enshrining the oracles into the network has very, very substantial upsides beyond security.

Ian:

That makes sense. You made a comment a moment ago that data in the crypto landscape is sort of fundamentally broken. Can you be more specific? Maybe a couple examples that we can latch onto.

Hugo:

I mean, I think the biggest issue I have is that there's billions being spent on infrastructure trying to achieve higher performance, decentralized compute. But if your data isn't decentralized, there's very limited reason to use decentralized compute to feed centralized data into decentralized compute. To me, that calculus doesn't stack up.

Ian:

Okay. So if I think about the constraining factor in most blockchains is block space fairly limited. And so most people are offloading data related to whatever's actually getting represented on chain. Maybe the easiest example comes to mind is with NFTs, where the actual art associated with most NFTs sits in a file system somewhere off the blockchain and the on-chain representation is just a pointer to a file location, a URI of some sort.

Some of those do use decentralized file storage like IPFS. We recently had someone from the Filecoin Foundation on the podcast, but a lot of it sits in Amazon S3. So am I tracking the point you're making there that if we're keeping all our data in something like S3, that we're not really getting to the decentralization?

Hugo:

I'd go a lot further. I'd say that existing Oracle systems are not giving you decentralization. They're not giving you safety. NFTs are one aspect, relatively small market cap relative to the amount of value that's being transacted across protocols that are pulling data from existing oracle systems. To us, it doesn't really compute that if you're using essentially centralized data, you really don't need to pay for block space. You can just do it all in Amazon S3 anyway.

Ian:

Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that would probably be the critic of people that look at a lot of the application architectures that get built on blockchain. It's like, ""Wow, you've gone and done a huge amount of engineering work to make a blockchain inside of an app that probably would be fairly straightforward otherwise."" But let's dive in on specifically, your critique of the status quo is that most of the applications running on blockchains today, so thinking about automated market makers or DEXes, they depend on pricing data, which is usually supplied by an oracle And that system is inherently not decentralized and so therefore less good than we would want it in an idealized system.

Hugo:

Just to pick you up on that, I mean, AMMs thankfully don't depend on data, at least most of the versions we're familiar with like USwap, but lending protocols do, perks DEXes do. Anything financial, real world assets that needs to have a price does. Anything to do with being able to do proofs from other chains or from Web2 into the space needs data. To give you an example, a really simple example of where this is falling down... The lowest number of data providers, if you take existing Oracle systems, the lowest number of data providers that is serving a particular price, there is five. It's an incredibly low threshold for collusion.

Ian:

I think I understand the problem now fully, so let's talk about the solution with Flare. What does it really mean to have an oracle embedded into the chain? What does that look like? And maybe you can compare and contrast against like an Ethereum architecture that people are probably familiar with.

Hugo:

Yeah. What are we solving for? Flare's protocols are solving for cost, security, and flexibility by enshrining the oracles into the chain as in integrating both the infrastructure and the security budget that is staking into one role and having a single token.

Flare's able to offer data at a much lower cost than a third party oracle like Chainlink or Pyth, because they ultimately are equal users of the chain like everyone else. Much of the data on Flare is free because of that. And it means that we also don't have to have a token, which means that we can keep our data free and the network can benefit by people building with that data, using it in their applications and generating transaction volume.

Secondly, by unifying the security of the network with the oracle through merging that validator and data provider role, we can maximize the decentralization and the security budget. Flare has 100 infrastructure providers who are providing validation, but each one of them is contributing to every single price. On Flare, we can have up to 1,000 prices updated every single block and each one of our 100 infrastructure providers is contributing to every price. And we have about 67% of the circulating supply of our token, securing those infrastructure providers in some way either staked directly or delegated to their oracles.

In terms of the decentralization, having a large number of providers providing a price and on Flare, that's essentially a cohesive number of providers providing a price and having a very, very high security budget. No other project really comes close to providing that level of protection around data. Lastly, because we've built the oracle into the chain, we have had a lot of flexibility on the design, which means that we can optimize the chain for being able to handle data, being able to minimize cost of handling that data, whereas third party oracles are very constrained by the network they're operating on, they're constrained to the design decisions made by another network.

Ian:

Do you have a specific example of some of those design constraints that don't apply in the Flare context?

Hugo:

Oh, for instance, we can give a rebate within the network for submitting prices.

During periods of very, very high traffic, we can essentially charge the standard gas fee but rebate that back later.

Ian:

Interesting. Quite a bit different than the architecture that people are probably familiar with on other networks. Just so I'm clear on the... My role as a validator in, say, Ethereum, I'm basically accepting requested transactions, producing blocks ultimately. I have to have some amount of Eth in the node if I'm running a full node on my own, like 32 Eth. If I start falling down on my responsibilities to accept transactions and produce blocks or I'm trying to manipulate them in some way, eventually that catches up my staked assets or rewards will be struck. And if I do things like don't keep the node up or operate in the right way, all my assets are kind of ultimately at risk. Same basic concept here, but then I have an added responsibility of providing this oracle data as well. Is that right?

On Flare, you'll earn zero validated rewards unless you are also part of the oracle and submitting.

Ian:

And how does that work? Let's say that the data is not inherently on the chain, so it's some piece of information that I need to pull in. Like you mentioned, real world asset prices earlier, so I need to collect that from somewhere. Does that mean that every entity, your 100 infrastructure providers need to then figure out how to go and collect that commodity price data from somewhere?

Yeah. We were shocked when we launched what we call our canary net, which is called Songbird. How quickly that happened and how quickly, actually, machine learning took over, how quickly people started integrating machine learning into their role as a data provider in order to essentially provide something that was getting into the rewarded set. Essentially, their machine learning was interpolating where the price was when they sampled it versus where they thought the price would be when the submission is revealed. That's been very interesting to watch. In fact, there's been an arms race within our oracle in order to provide a better signal.

Ian:

Interesting. And what happens when someone wants a new piece of data that doesn't exist? How does that then get added to the oracle set?

Hugo:

This is quite nice. Essentially, we have 100 data providers and we have an ability to upgrade or update what the prices are, what's being put onto the chain essentially. And that's just a very simple governance system, whereby people make a request, the providers look at the request, and they vote across themselves whether they feel that they can add it.

Ian:

Fascinating. Democratic governments around data access and control. I recently had the head of product from Chainlink Labs on the podcast and one of the things that they seem to be very focused on was the next generation of their architecture, which enables... They call it the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol or CCIP. And so they seem to be moving up stack in some ways from just being the classic oracle data provider feed to a general purpose message broker across multiple chains, which in theory also allows not just information but actual value to flow between chains.

Their argument was better than bridges, more secure because of the nature of the validation security architecture. I am curious, as you think about people using Flare, there's always this challenge of like, ""Well, how do I get onto Flare? Do I need a new wallet? Do I need a new set of assets that I don't currently produce? How do I pay for things like gas? So I need the native token."" How does one get into the ecosystem and do you see eventually maybe building to what Chainlink has developed with CCIP or do you have other ideas on potentially a more secure path there?

Hugo:

I mean, we've just done a partnership with LayerZero, Stargate, which already serves... It already essentially is handling that kind of messaging that CCIP is trying to get to. I think the first version of LayerZero I would've bulk tap in terms of its safety, but they're V2 architecture, which allows for decentralized validated networks of which we could potentially build our own DVN. Flare is kind of already a DVN. We just need to figure out how to integrate that specifically with LayerZero.

That's kind of their out-of-the-box with Flare, but more specifically, I think the DVN model is much more interesting than CCIP because it's modular. It has modular security. Meaning, for a very low value transaction, I can choose a DVN that maybe has 10 people. It's not really important. It's maybe $1, $5. For a very high value transfer, I can customize my security by choosing some set of DVNs. That's really much more interesting than trying to create one cohesive network from my perspective for that kind of thing.

I think interoperability solutions are broadly fairly well-gated for, but I do think there's complexities in some of them, but I think the DVN model and essentially the modular security that things like LayerZero offer is probably about as good as you can get.

Ian:

Yeah, that's great. I mean, I think LayerZero is a really interesting alternative to CCIP, so that's exciting to know that it's already connected to the network. Maybe contextualize a little bit who's using Flare today and where have you maybe seen some of the sweet spots in terms of things that people are able to do, given your unique architecture relative to, say, Ethereum?

Hugo:

I mean, we have quite a sizable number of people that have decided to build on the chain. We have, really, a lot of DeFi protocols at this point and Gnosis being one of the first [inaudible 00:26:21] and a lending protocol. The Stargate I just mentioned and LayerZero, Kenetic lending protocol, same group that built BENQI. They've also built something called Sceptre, which is a liquid version of our state token. We have SparkDEX which is both a V2, a V3 Uniswap and a perks DEX.

There's quite a large group of entities that have built... Those are the ones that have come on very recently. Obviously, we have quite a few partnerships with a lot of entities around the space that do professional validation. One of the data providers on Flare that're providing data and doing validation is Google Cloud. So I think we've... When we talk to developers, they absolutely love what Flare is doing and why. And that's because basically if they're on the Ethereum architecture, the principle way to consume data is Chainlink and that really sort of goes to the differences of Flare and Chainlink.

For starters, Flare is a EVM layer one with enshrined oracles. Chainlink's a third party data provider. We have four real key differences: decentralization, security, cost, and ease of use. We've really been through decentralization. Chainlink's most demanded feed has, I think, 31 providers, none [inaudible 00:28:05] staked. I believe they have some kind of staking system in beta, but, I think, in their beta, they have about 7% of their token that is staked. So 31 data providers in their most used price and they have 11 in their least used priced. Whereas as I said, on Flare, all 100 are providing that information.

In terms of stake, Chainlink's using 7%. We're at about 67%. These elements really mean that you're just trusting Chainlink, and so developers really, really like the aspect about Flare that they feel more comfortable and our feeds are much, much cheaper. In fact, all of them are currently free and there will be the opportunity to pay later when you're demanding more complex data, more expensive data to retrieve. That is built into the system already, but I think the biggest thing that really matters to engineers, at least from the construction of the app side, is the ease of use.

When you are a developer looking at using existing oracle systems, you have to analyze the security of each feed. As I said, the worst Pyth feed has five data providers. That's not a safe feed and this means that developers not only are having to build a product, but they're also having to be a risk analyst, which they don't really want to be. And so I don't think forcing developers to analyze the risk of your pricing is a sensible thing.

This really makes for developers a much greater experience and encourages innovation both on Flare but also on innovation of data, because when we add a feed, it has the same safety as the most demanded feed. It means if a developer wants new data, then we can add that feed and that data can be consumed and that really encourages innovation. Broadly, if you're developing on Ethereum, it's a fantastic platform as is, to be honest with you, Solana, but I think they've done some very interesting things. I don't necessarily appreciate all of them, but they're great platforms. But ultimately if you want data, you have a limited choices.

Ian:

Yeah. One of the things that occurred to me while you were explaining that is when I think about pricing failures that have been spectacular, it's typically been in the context of a flash loan attack, where I'm able to buy a fairly thinly traded or low supply token, manipulate the price in some way, take a loan against that inflated value, then convert that loan to asset into some other asset, stable coins or whatever, and kind of run off with the money and never pay the loan back. At least as I understand those failures, and maybe you'll tell me I'm wrong, it's less about the data feed setting the prices and the lending protocol being corrupted themselves and it's more about relying on a single price or this easily manipulated price. So it's not strictly an oracle failure, at least as I've understood it, but maybe I've gotten this all wrong.

Hugo:

Well, I mean, there's a bunch of different ways you can have oracle failure.

For instance, with Pyth, there was very clear manipulation by the data providers in the early days. I don't know if it still exists, but certainly in the early days there was very clear manipulation by the data providers, principally because one of those data providers was FTX or Alameda. I can't remember. That was an absolute oracle design failure if your data providers can manipulate your feed.

I'd also argue that a lot of the reasons you haven't seen these kind of things is because there's really a pretense of decentralization within these things. Essentially, the data providers know the founder of the project.

But there's a number of other ways that oracles can go wrong. You have engineering mistakes, which I think was the most recent oracle issue with ROE. Essentially, someone took over the contract because probably, I think, a private key lead or something like that. But you shouldn't be able... If you engineer a protocol properly, you shouldn't be able to take over the contract from a single private key. That's not sensible.

On Flare, we try to rectify that with very, very extensive auditing and testing, then testing on a testnet, then testing on a canary net, and then we roll it out to Flare, our canary net, Songbird. If you have bad protocol design, I'd say that's what happens when you have limited number of data providers providing a particular price. The protocol is designed to allow for a limited number of data protocols to provide a price rather than... On flare, all data providers must provide the price, otherwise they don't get rewards. And so that's your protocol design, kept missed updates and that has happened on Chainlink. This is from a lack of data providers. Flare doesn't suffer from that.

Lack of decentralization is obviously the big one. And then the biggest one that matters to me and the thing is the mismatching, your safety budget relative to the value of the protocols that your oracle is serving. Obviously, if the stake you have at risk is less than the value from an attack, then the probability of the oracle stealing the money is higher.

Ian:

Yeah. I'm curious, going down the path of decentralization, one of the things that... It seems like a number of teams building on Solana are attempting to do is create fully on-chain order book. It seems like the gap to doing that on other chains has been primarily one of performance. At least that's how it's been articulated by the folks who have chosen to build on Solana, where you've got this higher transaction throughput. But you chose to build on the EVM chain. Any thoughts on that? It's like trying to deliver an on-chain order book in the long-term roadmap or is that something...

Hugo:

Well, we actually have a project on Flare that I should have mentioned earlier called Rainlang that has built an on-chain order book, essentially an on-chain order book through solvers. So you submit the things you wish to trade around, your prices and all that kind of stuff, on chain, and then the solvers essentially create those trades once the prices hit. I think that's an interesting way to do it for the EVM world. Our interest is in developer adoption. Obviously, Solana has had a lot of adoption now, although I would question how much of it's real versus how much of it's just meme coins.

There's a lot of meme coins. The ratio is probably 95:5. I'm not certain. EVM has generally been, and I think continues to be, the broad mechanism for adoption of a layer one or a layer two. I think the biggest aspect of this is can you take compute off chain if you really want high performance? Because you can't... Even Solana proves that you can't have extensive decentralization if you want very high performance. Using on-chain compute, what compute can you take off-chain that allows you to get that performance without sacrificing too much decentralization?

Ian:

Interesting. So it sounds like you're suggesting that oracle architecture native to Flare allows you to potentially take more compute off-chain yet still have...

Hugo:

I mean, the oracle architecture is an off-chain compute system to start with, so we're broadly just doing proofs of everything.

Ian:

Yeah. Fascinating. Totally different direction for my next question. The big tug of war, I think, in the industry right now relates to responsibility at the chain and protocol level and token issuer level for what's happening in the ecosystem, where we have this multilayered know-your-customer, anti-money laundering regime, and traditional finance. Can that be replayed across crypto ecosystem? I'm curious to hear where you fall on the view of that push from regulators generally, and then specifically anything that maybe is happening in the Flare ecosystem potentially related to permissioning or KYC that's maybe native in the network.

Hugo:

I think, app-based, the native token and the network itself has to be permissionless and decentralized, otherwise there's no point being here. I think there are aspects, especially when you're touching real world assets, which absolutely and very clearly meets the definitions under all regulations pretty much. I think when you are doing things that are regulated, you absolutely have to fit in to the regulated unit framework. I don't think that...

If you think about it, this space started out as a reaction to the global fiat system and there's two ways that it can become the system. And that is either through an abject failure of the existing system or through regulation, accepting that it becomes a bigger part of the system. Either you'll have all your chips on an abject failure, at which point crypto fills the void, or you accept that crypto isn't going to immediately tomorrow take over the entire space and the entire financial industry, and you accept that regulation where you build something that fits into the regulatory purview must exist and must happen.

With our data angle, we think that compliance and KYC and AML and being able to prove those kinds of things is something that Flare is going to capitalize on. In terms of permissioning, I probably haven't gotten on to some of the protocols we're building, but we're building a over collateralized bridge for Bitcoin and XRP, so to bring that to Flare over collateralize with stables in Flare. Some entities within that bridge will want the ability to do KYC on the counterparties that they're interacting with. Not all of them, but some of them, so we are building in KYC to that system as an optional aspect.

Ian:

That's really interesting. Say more about that. The built-in KYC, is that an on-chain validation system or you're doing kind of an off-chain?

Hugo:

Essentially, it's at the discretion of the party that is operating. It's a little complex to describe how the bridge operates. Essentially, it has an entity. It's more like a series of small bridges but it's one protocol, where each... Let's say I am an entity, I put up collateral. This allows me to receive Bitcoin and, against my receipt of Bitcoin, I am issued or whoever sent me the Bitcoin is issued Flare Bitcoin, and that is secured through my collateral that I've put up on Flare.

Now, in some cases, I may want to be able to KYC who is minting with me and redeeming with me and so building in KYC, basically. Building a KYC function into the protocol helps with that, and then the agent who's provided the collateral and is doing this work, they can go to any off-chain KYC provider that they like, that they're happy with. Ultimately, we'd like to bring the whole thing on-chain if possible.

Ian:

Yeah. It seems like the missing ingredient to bring something on-chain is like a verifiable proof of identity. There's lots of projects who are working on this, but it doesn't seem like we've actually settled on a particular one that people trust and will use reliably. It's sort of absent and we're stuck doing everything in the paper context.

Hugo:

Well, I think, for a start, what I would like is for... It would be nice for our agents in the system to be able to demonstrate. I called the Chainalysis API. This address that I'm interacting with was not on any list, was not on any blacklist. There was no evidence that this was a bad person. That's a really good stop.

Ian:

Yeah, I totally agree. I appreciate the shout-out there. That's an architecture I think we could get behind. Hugo, this has been a fantastic discussion. My customary closing question is always a look towards the future. What's coming on the roadmap for Flare that people should be watching out for?

Hugo:

I completely missed two things in this call, which was the Flare Data Connector, which is our ability to prove Web2 and Web3 events. That's coming on Flare towards September or October. That's very exciting.

Ian:

Talk a little bit more about that one. So the ability to prove Web2 events sounds fantastical to me. What does that mean in practice? Give us an example.

Hugo:

So it means basically using our data providers, the same entities that are providing prices, for providing... Essentially, you request an attestation from a Web2 API and our data providers go to that Web2 API and essentially we have a proofing system that uses Merkle trees and each event is a Merkle tree leaf. We end up proving the root, so that means we can end up proving... In a single cycle, we can prove almost an unbounded number of events. That event proof can then be used on-chain by any [inaudible 00:45:18].

Ian:

Wow, that sounds amazing. So that's launching in September.

Hugo:

Yes. It should be around September, October time. And then, I think I'll split this question into a couple of things. Also, we have a whole compute strategy, which I probably don't want an off-chain compute strategy using trusted execution environments, which I probably don't need to get into right now. But we're doing a very fun hackathon around that.

In the industry, I'm looking forward to seeing more forms of account abstraction, specifically one of the use cases we think for trusted execution environments is things like account abstraction being able to make it lower the barrier to entry for people to use blockchains. I mean, it would be really cool to make it just so much easier than a traditional bullet. I'm pretty interested to see how the political calculus shakes out-

.. [inaudible 00:46:27]. And depending on who wins, whether any of the promises that are made to the crypto community end up in anything concrete. And then on Flare, we have the second version of our oracle, what we call FTSOv2, so our price oracle going onto main net in September. Also in September, we've got the launch of that bridge I was just discussing called the FAssets, so being able to bridge Bitcoin and XRP onto Flare. Can't tell you exactly when that launch will be, but it'll certainly be fairly soon. Those are some of the things [inaudible 00:47:10].

Ian:

It sounds like a really busy fall for you all. Is that hackathon you mentioned open to the public? Anyone can participate?

Awesome. We will link to the details in the show notes so that people listening can go and find it if they're interested.",https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/episode-126-website-graphic.png,0.3411764705882352
BlockDAG or EarthMeta? The Smart Choice for Crypto Presale Investors,https://www.crypto-reporter.com/press-releases/blockdag-or-earthmeta-the-smart-choice-for-crypto-presale-investors-73988/,2024-08-19,Crypto Reporter,"If you did a bit of research on the next big crypto of the year, it's impossible that you don't know these two big names: BlockDAG and EarthMeta. These projects are generating buzz in every corner of the crypto world, from Telegram groups to Reddit threads. But if you're like most investors, you're probably wondering: which one should I bet my hard-earned money on?

Let us take you on a journey through the world of these two crypto titans, with some real talk, a few jokes to keep things light, and the kind of insight that comes from years of watching this wild, unpredictable market. We'll break down what makes each of these projects tick, compare their strengths and weaknesses, and maybe even drop a few truth bombs along the way.

If BlockDAG is about optimizing blockchain technology, EarthMeta is about creating an entirely new digital world. EarthMeta is building a metaverse platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to create immersive and interactive virtual environments. The vision behind EarthMeta is ambitious -- it's not just about creating a digital space, but about integrating real-world value into the metaverse.

EarthMeta is unique in its approach to integrating real-world data into its metaverse. Using AI algorithms, EarthMeta analyzes the value of real-world cities and mirrors this in its digital space. Users can buy, sell, and trade virtual real estate based on genuine economic insights. It's like playing Monopoly, but with real data and real financial implications.

EarthMeta offers a unique economic model where users can earn passive income through transactions that occur within their virtual properties. This isn't just a game -- it's a potential revenue stream. Owners of virtual cities can earn a 1% tax on all transactions within their land. Those who acquire the most valuable cities can become ""presidents"" of virtual countries, collecting taxes on all trades within their domain. This hierarchical structure creates a dynamic and potentially lucrative digital economy.

EarthMeta's presale strategy is designed with long-term stability in mind. Unlike many projects that dump a large percentage of their tokens into the market at once, EarthMeta's token release is staggered over eight weeks. This approach is intended to avoid radical price fluctuations and maintain stability for all holders. Additionally, the crypto presale participants receive incentives like free NFT cities and high staking rewards, adding immediate value to their participation.

Many are comparing BlockDAG to Bitcoin and to the potential changements it can bring. Let's give credit where it's due -- BlockDAG is doing something innovative. By using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, it's addressing some of the most significant issues plaguing traditional blockchains, like scalability and transaction speed. Imagine you're stuck in a long line at the airport security checkpoint. Every single person has to go through one at a time, right? That's how traditional blockchains work -- slow and steady. But BlockDAG is like the new, high-tech pre-check lane where multiple people can zip through simultaneously. It's faster, it's more efficient, and it promises a better experience for everyone.

Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum face limitations in transaction throughput because they add blocks sequentially. BlockDAG, however, can handle a much higher volume of transactions by allowing multiple blocks to be added at once. This could be a game-changer in industries where transaction speed and volume are critical.

In traditional blockchains, users often have to wait for a new block to be mined before their transactions are confirmed. With BlockDAG, the process is faster, as multiple blocks can be added at the same time, reducing the wait time for transaction confirmations.

The structure of BlockDAG makes it more difficult for malicious actors to attack the network. In a traditional blockchain, an attacker needs to control the majority of the network's hash power to alter the chain. In BlockDAG, the distributed nature of the graph makes such attacks much harder to execute.

While these features sound impressive, it's important to remember that the success of BlockDAG is not guaranteed. Like any emerging technology, it faces risks and challenges, particularly when it comes to execution.

BlockDAG's success hinges on more than just technical innovation. It's betting big on the idea that this advanced technology will be widely adopted across the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. And while it has indeed raised an impressive $63.9 million during its presale -- along with a price increase of over 1600% -- there's still a big question mark hovering over its future. The cryptocurrency landscape is littered with projects that started with great ideas but fizzled out when they couldn't convert those ideas into real-world adoption.

Consider EOS, a blockchain project that launched with a lot of hype, touting itself as the ""Ethereum killer."" It raised over $4 billion in its ICO but has struggled to deliver on its promises, primarily due to challenges in governance and scalability. BlockDAG could find itself in a similar situation -- full of potential but facing an uphill battle in a crowded market.

Both BlockDAG and EarthMeta offer exciting opportunities, but they cater to different types of investors. Let's break down the key differences:

BlockDAG is all about enhancing blockchain performance. If you're interested in the technical side of crypto, particularly in areas like scalability and transaction speed, BlockDAG might catch your eye. It's a project that aims to push the boundaries of what blockchain can do. EarthMeta, on the other hand, is focused on creating a metaverse platform. It's not just about blockchain; it's about integrating AI, real-world data, and creating a digital economy. If you're more interested in the concept of a digital universe where you can invest, socialize, and earn, EarthMeta could be your go-to.

BlockDAG's potential is tied to its ability to revolutionize blockchain technology. This could mean significant gains if the technology is adopted widely, but it's also a high-risk, high-reward scenario. EarthMeta offers a different kind of investment opportunity. It's not just about technology, but about creating a digital world with real economic implications. The presale incentives and staggered token release suggest that EarthMeta is thinking long-term, which might appeal to investors looking for steady growth rather than quick gains.

BlockDAG has focused heavily on raising funds and marketing globally. It has gained significant exposure in major cities and has a strong user base, thanks in part to its innovative mobile app. However, its success will largely depend on continued adoption and technological advancements.

EarthMeta's strategy is to offer a unique digital experience that mirrors the real world and it shows that the project is investing heavily on development with more than 70% of the team members being developers. By integrating real-world data and offering economic incentives, EarthMeta is creating a platform that could attract a wide range of users, from gamers to investors. Its staggered token release is also a smart move to maintain market stability, making it potentially less volatile than other projects.

If BlockDAG is the high-stakes gamble, EarthMeta is the calculated investment with a visionary twist. EarthMeta is a comprehensive digital world that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world data to create an immersive and interactive environment that feels more tangible and valuable than anything else out there.

EarthMeta's tokenomics are designed for long-term growth and stability, not just a quick pump and dump. Unlike BlockDAG, which has a massive supply of tokens that could dilute value, EarthMeta is taking a more conservative approach. Only 10% of its total supply is allocated to the presale, and the release of these tokens is staggered over eight weeks. This strategy is all about maintaining stability, reducing volatility, and ensuring that the market isn't flooded with tokens that crash the price.

Remember the ICO boom of 2017? Projects like Tezos and Filecoin raised huge amounts of money, but many investors were left disappointed when token prices plummeted due to poorly managed token releases. EarthMeta's staggered release strategy is designed to avoid these pitfalls, making it a safer bet for investors looking for steady, sustainable growth.

Also, EarthMeta isn't just about playing around in a digital sandbox. It's about creating a metaverse that mirrors the real world, with virtual real estate tied to actual economic data. You're not just buying a pixelated plot of land; you're investing in a piece of digital real estate that has real-world value, influenced by the economy of the cities it represents. Imagine owning virtual New York and watching its value soar as the real NYC thrives. That's the kind of opportunity EarthMeta offers -- real, grounded investment potential.

EarthMeta doesn't just offer speculative value -- it provides tangible, ongoing rewards for investors. By owning virtual cities, you can earn a 1% tax on all transactions within your land. And if you're ambitious enough to acquire the most valuable cities, you can become the ""president"" of a virtual country, collecting taxes on all trades within your borders. This isn't just a digital playground -- it's a serious economic model with real earning potential.

The metaverse is the buzzword of the year, but not all metaverses are created equal. Many projects out there are just trying to cash in on the hype, creating digital worlds with no real substance. EarthMeta stands out because it's building something with purpose -- a digital economy that's tied to real-world value. It's not just about looking cool in a virtual world; it's about creating a space where users can generate real income, make meaningful investments, and be part of an economy that's as dynamic as the one outside your window.

BlockDAG might catch the eye with its impressive presale numbers, but EarthMeta is playing the long term game. It's not just about what looks good now; it's about what will still be standing -- and thriving -- in five, ten, or twenty years.

While BlockDAG is busy solving blockchain's technical challenges, EarthMeta is creating a metaverse that's relevant to our lives today. By tying virtual real estate to real-world economic data, EarthMeta makes sure that its digital world isn't just a fantasy -- it's a real, grounded investment opportunity.

EarthMeta's use of AI and real-world data is impressive, but it's not just innovation for innovation's sake. It's about creating a metaverse that every people will actually use, invest in, and benefit from. It's accessible, understandable, and built on principles that have proven successful in the past -- principles like scarcity, real-world relevance, and a strong community foundation.

Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, but why? Because it's simple, it has a clear purpose, and it doesn't try to do everything. Many altcoins have tried to outshine Bitcoin with more features, more speed, more innovation -- but they've often failed to gain the same traction. EarthMeta is taking a page out of Bitcoin's book by focusing on doing a few things really well -- building a relevant, sustainable metaverse -- rather than trying to be everything to everyone.

Remember Second Life? It was one of the first virtual worlds that allowed people to live a ""second life"" online, complete with virtual real estate and a thriving economy. It was ahead of its time, but it lacked the integration with real-world data and the economic incentives that EarthMeta offers. Second Life paved the way, but EarthMeta is taking the concept to the next level by making sure its virtual world is not just fun, but financially rewarding.

At the end of the day, investing is about making smart decisions that align with your goals. If you're looking for a project that has the potential to revolutionize blockchain technology, BlockDAG is intriguing, but it comes with high risks. It's a bit like betting on the next Silicon Valley startup -- potentially huge returns, but the failure rate is high.

On the other hand, EarthMeta offers a more balanced approach. It combines innovation with practicality, creating a metaverse that's not just about entertainment, but about real-world value and long-term growth. Its strategy is clear, its risks are managed, and its potential for sustainable returns is strong.

So, if you're asking which of these projects is the better choice for your investment, the answer is EarthMeta. It's not just another option in a crowded market -- it's the smart choice for investors who want to be part of something that's built to last. In a world of hype, EarthMeta stands out as a project with substance, vision, and a clear path to success.",https://www.crypto-reporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/earthmeta_17.jpg,0.2941176470588236

Bitcoin transactions are processed quickly, usually within minutes, which means players can start playing or get hold of their winnings in a shorter time. This eliminates the waiting period linked to traditional banking options especially over weekends and public holidays.

Low transaction costs: Generally, bitcoins have lower fees than credit cards or even bank transfers do so if you use them for making payments when gambling internationally there will be no need to pay currency conversion charges.

Blockchain technology secures Bitcoin transactions thus deterring fraud attempts and hacking incidences from happening during such transfers. A player can also utilize secure wallet services when managing his/her funds using BTC as an additional layer of security.

The fact that bitcoin is accepted worldwide allows people from different parts of the world to play at internet casinos offering blackjack which may not be possible due local restrictions on banking facilities imposed by governments. Players who lack access to conventional financial systems can participate in web-based blackjack using bitcoins.

Most online gaming platforms give extra rewards such as bonuses or promotions exclusively targeting users transacting via BTC thereby adding value. A player utilizing digital currencies may receive improved incentives alongside loyalty awards unlike individuals employing traditional forms of money during gambling activities.

Being a decentralized network means that there is no single controlling body regulating Bitcoin transactions hence few chances for censoring payment denial service attacks. Players control their own purse strings thus promoting independence reliability throughout the entire betting process.

Below are some things you should consider when choosing a Bitcoin blackjack site. This will ensure that you have a safe, enjoyable and rewarding gaming experience.

Diverse Selection: Find a platform offering different types of blackjack games so you can keep trying new things.

Encryption: Make sure the site encrypts personal and financial details.

Equity: Select only reputable sites known for fairness; look out for provably fair systems which verify game integrity too.

Appealing deals: Check if there are any welcome bonuses (and how generous they are) plus ongoing promotions which may add substantial sums to your bankroll.

Player incentives: Some platforms give rewards based on loyalty or VIP schemes catering for regular users as well who would like extra benefits while playing frequently.

User-friendly design: Opt for intuitive interfaces where navigation through different sections is seamless thereby enhancing overall gaming experience on such websites.

Customer care options: Choose among those with 24/7 live chat support or other channels like email, phone etc where response times are quick and staff knowledgeable in assisting players promptly whenever need arises.

These considerations will help you identify the most suitable bitcoin blackjack site for your needs and enable you enjoy quality gameplay from start to finish.

Altcoins and the Future of Decentralized Applications (DApps),https://sheldonwalen.medium.com/altcoins-and-the-future-of-decentralized-applications-dapps-626ce478bc82,2024-09-13,Medium,"As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the interplay between altcoins and decentralized applications (DApps) stands out as a pivotal area of growth and innovation. Altcoins -- the myriad alternatives to Bitcoin -- offer unique functionalities and features that contribute significantly to the advancement of DApps. This synergy not only enhances the utility of blockchain technology but also paves the way for more sophisticated and decentralized solutions in various industries. For those seeking a reliable platform to explore this dynamic field, MyCoinChange.co stands out as a trusted resource, equipped to guide you through the intricacies of altcoins and the future of DApps.

The Evolution and Diversity of Altcoins

Altcoins encompass an expansive array of cryptocurrencies that emerged to address Bitcoin's limitations. As the market matured, these alternatives began to introduce novel functionalities that significantly contribute to the blockchain ecosystem. For instance, Ethereum revolutionized the space by enabling smart contracts, paving the way for complex DApps. Privacy-focused coins like Monero and Zcash offer enhanced confidentiality, while stablecoins such as Tether and USD Coin aim to reduce volatility in a fluctuating market. Platforms like Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot further enrich this landscape by offering developers advanced tools and interoperability options. This diverse ecosystem attracts a broad spectrum of users and developers, each drawn to the unique features offered by different altcoins. This continuous innovation fuels the growth of DApps, providing developers with a versatile toolkit to create more sophisticated applications. As altcoins evolve, they not only enhance the functionality and user experience of DApps but also drive the broader adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors.

Understanding Decentralized Applications (DApps)

Decentralized applications, or DApps, represent a groundbreaking shift in software development, enabling applications to run on peer-to-peer networks rather than centralized servers. This decentralized architecture offers a multitude of benefits, such as heightened security, increased transparency, and greater resistance to censorship. With Ethereum at the forefront, thanks to its advanced support for smart contracts, numerous blockchain platforms now host DApps. These applications span a wide array of functionalities. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, for instance, facilitate lending and borrowing without intermediaries, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to trade assets directly with one another. The trend towards decentralization is evident across various sectors, empowering users with greater control over their data and financial transactions. As DApp technology continues to mature, we can expect a surge in innovative solutions addressing real-world challenges and optimizing processes across diverse industries.

The Symbiotic Relationship Between Altcoins and DApps

Altcoins and decentralized applications (DApps) share a mutually beneficial relationship that propels the advancement of blockchain technology. Altcoins, with their unique attributes and capabilities, often serve as the backbone for DApps, providing the essential infrastructure and native tokens required for seamless operations. For instance, tokens like Ethereum's Ether (ETH) facilitate smart contract executions, enabling a range of decentralized activities from DeFi services to NFT marketplaces. This interplay extends beyond mere transactional functions. Altcoins introduce innovative tokenomics and governance models that DApps leverage to enhance user engagement and functionality. Take Uniswap's UNI token, which plays a crucial role in the platform's decentralized trading and governance, giving users a stake in the protocol's future. Similarly, privacy-focused altcoins like Monero are utilized in DApps that prioritize user confidentiality, offering solutions where traditional financial systems fall short. This dynamic fosters a continuous cycle of innovation. As DApps push the boundaries of what's possible in decentralized ecosystems, they drive demand for new and improved altcoin features. This, in turn, inspires further development and diversification of altcoins, making the ecosystem richer and more robust. Such synergy not only catalyzes the growth of blockchain applications but also bolsters the adoption of decentralized technologies across various sectors.

Security and Stability Concerns in the Altcoin and DApp Ecosystem

The impressive growth of altcoins and DApps has unfortunately been accompanied by significant security challenges. With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, both users and developers are acutely aware of the need for robust security measures. High-profile breaches and scams have highlighted vulnerabilities within decentralized systems, prompting a wave of innovation aimed at fortifying these platforms. Developers are now prioritizing comprehensive security audits and adopting best coding practices to ensure the integrity of DApps and altcoin protocols. Additionally, decentralized governance models are being implemented to enhance resilience against malicious attacks. On the user side, platforms like MyCoinChange lead the charge by employing state-of-the-art security protocols to safeguard assets and ensure a stable trading environment. This proactive approach not only protects users but also fosters trust and stability in the burgeoning ecosystem of altcoins and decentralized applications.

How ethereum works: The value of ethereum in the current market,https://omaha.com/life-entertainment/how-ethereum-works-the-value-of-ethereum-in-the-current-market/article_242a9c78-bb72-5802-9d50-e1f90ddc0820.html,2024-08-20,Omaha.com,"When many think of blockchain technology or cryptocurrency, Bitcoin immediately comes to mind. And it's easy to see why: Bitcoin is the largest and most successful form of cryptocurrency. But while Bitcoin is immensely successful at the moment, another form of cryptocurrency has steadily been rising in value over the past several years: Ethereum.

The ETH to USD exchange rate as of August 6, 2024, is that one ETH is equivalent to 2,458.72 USD, marking a 1.71% increase against the exchange rate of USD as markets opened that day.

How Does it Work?

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that acts as an open-source public service. It utilizes blockchain technology to allow for secure trading without the involvement of third-party oversight. Ethereum is available in two forms: externally owned accounts (controlled by private keys influenced by human users) and contract accounts.

Ethereum is also specifically designed with data allocated for developers to deploy multiple forms of decentralized apps. While Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum's expeditious growth has taken the industry by storm.

The History of Ethereum

Vitalik Buterin co-founded Ethereum. In 2014, Buterin and his co-founders launched a crowdsourcing campaign that sold Ether (Ethereum tokens) to raise enough funds and awareness about the product to make their vision a reality. In the process, they ultimately raised more than $18 million. The first genuinely official release of Ethereum proper, Frontier, was launched in 2015.

While Ethereum's growth has been anything but stable or incidental, it has shown significant capability for growth. While the fluctuations in its value may occasionally be quite extreme, the value of Ethereum rose an astounding 10,000% in 2017.

How Ethereum Differs From Bitcoin

While Ethereum and Bitcoin are both forms of cryptocurrency, there are some substantial differences. Bitcoin trades in cryptocurrency, while Ethereum has several different trading options, including cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

These different trading options are all based on different security protocols, which are designed to keep the trading safe and secure. Where Bitcoin utilizes a ""proof of work"" system, Ethereum uses a ""proof of stake."" Bitcoin allows only permissionless transactions; Ethereum allows both permissioned and permissionless transactions.

Mining Is Faster Than You Might Expect

Ethereum's average block time is also substantially less than that of Bitcoin. According to an analysis by a blockchain company, The amount of time block generation time takes varies. For Bitcoin, the estimated time is about 10 minutes, and for Ethereum it's only about 12 seconds.

This translates into more block confirmations, which allows Ethereum's miners to complete more blocks and receive more Ether than Bitcoin users can in the same amount of time.

In short, while Ethereum may not have the brand ubiquity or cultural prominence of Bitcoin, it is still a more worthwhile cryptocurrency that many investors are observing as its value evolves.

"SafeWallet: A Comprehensive Exploration of Its Design, Functionality, and Security",https://techbullion.com/safewallet-a-comprehensive-exploration-of-its-design-functionality-and-security/,2024-09-12,TechBullion,"As cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular, the need for reliable and secure tools to manage digital assets has become more critical than ever. SafeWallet, a secure and versatile crypto wallet developed by SafeCryptoWallet.io, aims to provide users with an innovative solution for storing, managing, and transacting cryptocurrencies. This article offers a detailed overview of SafeWallet, focusing on the process of generating unique wallet addresses, its design and functionality, password management, and more.

In this article, we will look into the concepts surrounding cryptocurrency wallets in general, how SafeWallet fits into the crypto ecosystem, and examine the functionality of SafeWallet's core features.

Definition: What Is a Crypto Wallet?

A cryptocurrency wallet, also known as a crypto wallet, is a digital tool that allows users to securely store, manage, and transact cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. These wallets can be used for a wide variety of purposes, from managing large amounts of cryptocurrency for long-term storage to executing regular transactions or interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).

Crypto wallets do not store cryptocurrencies in a traditional sense; instead, they store private keys, which grant users access to their assets recorded on a blockchain. These keys are essential for validating and securing transactions, ensuring that only the rightful owner has access to their crypto assets.

Types of Crypto Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets come in different types, each designed to balance convenience, functionality, and security. The two primary categories of wallets are hot wallets and cold wallets.

Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are those connected to the internet, making them convenient for frequent transactions. Because of their connectivity, they are more susceptible to cyberattacks and hacks. Hot wallets are ideal for users who need quick access to their funds but also come with higher security risks. Examples include mobile wallets, web wallets, and some desktop wallets.

Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are offline and are therefore considered far more secure. They are typically used for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies. Examples of cold wallets include hardware wallets and paper wallets, which store private keys offline, away from potential online vulnerabilities.

SafeWallet: An Overview

SafeWallet stands out among crypto wallets for its robust security features and user-friendly design. Built by SafeCryptoWallet.io, SafeWallet has been carefully designed to cater to both beginners and advanced crypto users, making it easy to store, manage, and transact digital assets while offering top-tier security measures. The platform strikes an optimal balance between convenience and security.

SafeWallet Address Generation

One of the most critical components of SafeWallet's functionality is the process of generating unique wallet addresses. When a user creates a new wallet in SafeWallet, the app generates a unique cryptographic key pair. This key pair consists of a public key and a private key.

Public Key: Functions like an account number that can be shared with others to receive payments. It is mathematically linked to the private key and is used to derive the wallet address. Users can freely share their public keys without compromising the security of their funds. Private Key: Acts as the password or secret key to the user's wallet. This key must never be shared, as it grants full control over the wallet's funds. The private key is required for signing transactions and proving ownership of the associated funds.

The wallet address is generated by running the public key through a hashing algorithm, ensuring that each wallet is uniquely identifiable on the blockchain. SafeWallet's process for generating addresses is secure, ensuring that users' private keys are kept confidential and are never exposed during the generation process.

Design and Functionality of Passwords

SafeWallet's password management system is designed with user security as its priority. The passwords are used in conjunction with a private key to access the wallet, adding an extra layer of protection. SafeWallet requires users to create a strong, complex password when setting up their wallet.

Recovery Phrase

A core security feature of SafeWallet is its recovery phrase, also known as a seed phrase. Upon setting up a new wallet, users are provided with a recovery phrase that typically consists of 12 random words. This phrase is essential for recovering access to the wallet if the user's device is lost or damaged. The recovery phrase should be stored in a secure, offline location, as anyone who obtains it can access the associated wallet.

Ownership and the Role of Private Keys

A key concept in understanding cryptocurrency wallets like SafeWallet is that they do not store actual cryptocurrencies. Instead, they store private keys, which serve as proof of ownership and allow users to access the cryptocurrencies recorded on the blockchain.

The blockchain itself is a distributed ledger that records all transactions, and cryptocurrencies are represented as balances associated with a particular public address. Accessing these funds requires the corresponding private key, which is why safeguarding the private key is of utmost importance.

In non-custodial wallets like SafeWallet, users have full control over their private keys. This contrasts with custodial wallets, where a third-party entity (such as a cryptocurrency exchange) holds the private keys on behalf of the user. While custodial wallets offer convenience, they also introduce risks, as users must trust the third party to keep their funds safe.

Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets

As mentioned earlier, crypto wallets can be categorized into hot wallets and cold wallets. Each category has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two often depends on the user's specific needs.

Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are always connected to the internet, making them perfect for users who need frequent access to their cryptocurrencies. SafeWallet, as a mobile and software-based wallet, can be categorized as a hot wallet. Its constant connectivity allows for seamless transactions and quick access to funds, making it ideal for everyday use.

However, the trade-off is that hot wallets are more vulnerable to hacking attempts, malware, and phishing attacks. SafeWallet mitigates these risks through strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and secure password management.

Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, such as hardware wallets or paper wallets, store private keys offline. This makes them immune to most forms of online attacks, as there is no internet connection through which a hacker can gain access. Cold wallets are generally recommended for long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency that do not need to be frequently accessed.

Hardware wallets, like those offered by Ledger or Trezor, are popular cold wallet options. These devices store private keys in a secure, offline environment, ensuring maximum security.

Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets, such as SafeWallet, are highly convenient for users who need to access their crypto on the go. These wallets are apps installed on smartphones and allow users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency at their fingertips.

SafeWallet's mobile app is designed for ease of use without compromising security. It integrates with blockchain networks to allow users to quickly access their assets and perform transactions while maintaining a high level of protection for private keys.

Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are physical devices that store private keys offline. They are considered one of the most secure ways to store cryptocurrency. Since the private keys are never exposed to the internet, they are safe from online attacks.

While SafeWallet does not function as a hardware wallet, it can integrate with hardware wallets to provide an additional layer of security for users who prefer cold storage for long-term assets.

Software Wallets

Software wallets are digital programs that run on computers or mobile devices. SafeWallet, as a software wallet, provides a user-friendly interface for managing crypto assets. It offers advanced features such as password encryption, and support for multiple cryptocurrencies.

Software wallets, while convenient, are considered hot wallets and are therefore more vulnerable to online attacks compared to hardware wallets.

Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets

SafeWallet is a non-custodial wallet, meaning that users have full control over their private keys. This contrasts with custodial wallets, which are managed by third parties such as exchanges.

The non-custodial nature of SafeWallet gives users complete ownership of their crypto assets and reduces the risk associated with trusting third parties with private keys. However, it also means that users are solely responsible for safeguarding their private keys and recovery phrases.

Backup Importance and Recovery Phrases

Regular backups are critical for securing any cryptocurrency wallet. SafeWallet provides users with a recovery phrase during the wallet creation process. This recovery phrase is the key to restoring access to the wallet if the device it is installed on is lost, stolen, or damaged.

Without the recovery phrase, users could permanently lose access to their funds. Therefore, SafeWallet advises users to store the recovery phrase in a secure, offline location, such as a safe, to prevent unauthorized access.

Security Best Practices

SafeWallet places a strong emphasis on security. Here are some of the best practices recommended by SafeWallet to ensure the safety of user funds:

Store Private Keys Offline: While SafeWallet provides secure storage for private keys, users who store large amounts of cryptocurrency should consider keeping their private keys offline, either in a hardware wallet or a paper wallet. Backup Your Recovery Phrase: The recovery phrase is critical for restoring access to your wallet. Always store it in a secure location, and never share it with anyone. Use Strong Passwords: SafeWallet requires users to set up strong passwords to access their wallets. Using a complex, unique password significantly reduces the chances of being hacked. Beware of Phishing Scams: Phishing attacks are a common method used by hackers to steal private keys and recovery phrases. Users should be cautious of emails, websites, or messages that ask for sensitive information and always ensure they are interacting with the legitimate SafeWallet platform. Paper Wallets and Staking

While SafeWallet does not primarily function as a paper wallet, users can generate paper wallets as an extra layer of security. A paper wallet involves printing out the private and public keys on a piece of paper, which can be stored offline.

Cross-Platform Compatibility

SafeWallet offers cross-platform compatibility, meaning it can be used across multiple devices. Whether on a desktop, mobile phone, or tablet, users can access their SafeWallet account and manage their crypto assets seamlessly across all devices. This feature is particularly useful for users who need flexibility in how they manage their cryptocurrency holdings.

Conclusion

SafeWallet is a powerful and secure solution for managing cryptocurrencies. Its design and functionality prioritize user security, offering features like password encryption, two-factor authentication, multi-signature capabilities, and a recovery phrase for wallet recovery. With the ability to manage multiple cryptocurrencies, stake assets, and integrate with both hot and cold wallets, SafeWallet provides a versatile platform for both novice and experienced crypto users.

By adhering to best practices in password management, backing up recovery phrases, and taking advantage of advanced security features, SafeWallet users can confidently manage their digital assets while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or loss. Whether for regular transactions or long-term storage, SafeWallet is positioned as a reliable tool in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Since the beginning of 2023, the global crypto market cap has grown by 167%, while Bitcoin's market cap has surged by an impressive 276%, with a pure price increase of 258%. This has propelled Bitcoin's dominance from 38% to 54% (data: Coingecko), capturing the public's attention and overshadowing other cryptocurrencies.

Indeed, those other cryptos, also called altcoins, were mostly dragged along by Bitcoin. Their market cap has grown only 112% since January 2023, excluding stablecoins whose supply grew by 52%, while prices (obviously) remained stable.

However, it might be too early to dismiss the altcoins. While Bitcoin has been enjoying growing institutional and political attention, the teams behind many other cryptoassets have been hard at work, developing their products and services to offer real value beyond the hype of the previous bull run.

The larger crypto space is evolving, drawing in users and VC money. Here are the main trends to consider when trying to understand if and when the altcoin season will come.

Web3 activity

Most altcoins represent the business side of the crypto industry, leaving the ""money"" function to the undisputed champion that is Bitcoin. Native cryptocurrencies, such as ETH or SOL, reflect the blockchains' development. Tokens, such as UNI or USDT, represent decentralized applications (DApps) built on blockchains, as well as stablecoins/collectibles/memecoins issued on them. The success of these DApps and tokens drives demand for their respective blockchains' native currencies, used to pay transaction fees.

That's why monitoring web3 trends is a worthwhile task. As shown by the recent data from DappRadar, DApps activity has seen an impressive rise since 2023, with the number of unique active wallets (UAW) on the top 12 blockchains increasing 15-fold.

Currently, the most popular DApps are built on opBNB (layer-2 on BNB chain), NEAR, and Ronin, which register 30 million, 19 million, and 12 million daily UAW, respectively.

The most popular web3 sectors include crypto gaming, led by gaming studio Boomland with 2.4 million monthly UAW, and social platforms, like decentralized content distribution platform Revox, with almost 10 million monthly UAW.

In comparison, DeFi is struggling to attract more users. However, according to DeFiLlama, the current total value locked (TVL) of $146 billion is 2.5 times the amount in January 2023. Ethereum remains the leading blockchain by TVL, with $100 billion, of which $27 billion is locked in Lido, a liquid staking protocol.

VC investment

Another way to gauge the future of web3 is to examine VC activity. Venture capital still plays a vital role in creating and developing crypto projects. Recent reports by Pitchbook and Galaxy Digital shed light on this year's VC deals.

According to Galaxy, the amount of capital invested by the VC is slightly on the rise this year, with $5.7 billion invested since January. However, the numbers are still much lower than at the peak of the Web3 hype in 2022.

There is also a qualitative shift in VC funding. Pitchbook's senior analyst Robert Le notes, ""investors are concentrating capital into a smaller range of opportunities. There's a flight to quality. A few years ago, their investments were more spread out across the space."" Currently, the most popular narratives among venture capitalists include the DApps industry (crypto gaming, social, and decentralized physical infrastructure, or DePIN) and blockchain networks.

It is rather surprising that new blockchains still attract significant interest. According to Le, there are over 150 layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains operating, and not all are likely to be viable long-term. He predicts that ""Solana, Bitcoin, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base are the winners"".

The web3 sector, including DApps and the blockchains they are built on, along with their respective cryptoassets, still needs to prove itself and its value to the users to regain investor interest. Judging by the increasing user activity, this process may already be underway, potentially leading to a new hype cycle soon. Furthermore, historically, any prolonged BTC price rises have eventually triggered altcoin hype, and we might be approaching this moment. Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes recently stated that if Bitcoin and Ether decisively break through $70,000 and $4,000, respectively, it could ""create a strong foundation for the return of a sexy shitcoin soiree"" by the end of the year. We'll soon find out if this forecast comes to pass.",https://img.zonebourse.com/reuters/2022-05-25T125506Z_1_LYNXNPEI4O0LR_RTROPTP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-CRYPTO-CURRENCY-WOOD.JPG,0.1450980392156862
Will Crypto Recover: Analyzing Market Trends and Economic Indicators,https://coinpaper.com/5127/will-crypto-recover,2024-08-26,Coinpaper,"Cryptocurrencies have had their share of ups and downs, and there's a lot of debate about their future. Many experts believe crypto will likely recover, driven by factors like SEC rule changes, inflation, and interest rates. For instance, the Forbes Advisor article forecasts a rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in 2024.

Recent discussions on crypto Twitter show influential voices like @CryptoAnalystJoe and @BlockchainQueen arguing that Bitcoin ETF approvals could be a game-changer. They suggest that institutional interest will boost market confidence and inflows. Additionally, historical data indicates that crypto markets often rebound after severe downturns, suggesting a possibility for future recovery.

Events like the FTX collapse have impacted trading volumes and investor sentiment, leading to cautious optimism. The market's shift towards regulation and decentralization could lay the groundwork for a more stable and trustworthy ecosystem. In essence, while the road to recovery might be rocky, the potential for cryptocurrencies to bounce back remains firm.

Cryptocurrency markets have exhibited cyclical behavior, often bouncing back after significant declines. Understanding these cycles and comparing them to trends in traditional markets can offer insights into potential recoveries.

Cryptocurrencies have experienced several notable cycles. The 2017 bull run, driven by Bitcoin's surge to nearly $20,000, was followed by a sharp bear market in 2018. Bitcoin fell to around $3,000, but by late 2020, it retested record highs and crossed $60,000 in 2021.

Similarly, the 2013 run was driven by increased adoption but faced a correction in 2014. These cycles often coincide with significant technological advancements and increased mainstream acceptance. For example, introducing Ethereum and smart contracts in 2015 helped fuel later growth. As Nasdaq highlights, volatility remains high, making understanding these cycles essential.

Crypto markets often draw comparisons to traditional financial markets. While both exhibit cycles, crypto tends to be more volatile. Traditional markets like stocks and commodities also experience booms and busts, usually in response to broader economic factors such as interest rates and economic growth.

Cryptos react strongly to regulatory news, technological changes, and macroeconomic events. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold or tech stocks during market fluctuations suggests some parallels, but differences remain significant. Events like the 2022 implosions highlighted in US News demonstrate the crypto space's unique risks and recovery paths.

The cryptocurrency market has undergone significant changes in recent years. Investors closely monitor market trends and economic conditions, which impact crypto prices and trading volume.

The crypto market has been volatile, with many investors seeking direction on future trends. In 2024, Ethereum prices have increased by 41.8%, showing signs of recovery. However, the overall market capitalization remains lower than its peak in November 2021, reaching over $2.9 trillion.

Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are still recovering from losses during the so-called ""crypto winter."" Trading volumes have fluctuated, reflecting changing investor sentiment. Many analysts suggest that these changes are partly due to broader market conditions, regulatory news, and technological advancements.

Key market indicators, such as trading volume and cap, provide insight into potential trends. Experts on crypto Twitter have noted increased interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and emerging blockchain technologies. This interest points to a possible shift in the market dynamics and a focus on long-term value.

Global economic conditions play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market's state. Inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical events influence investor behavior. The recent rise in interest rates has led to tighter financial conditions, affecting global stock markets and cryptocurrencies.

Often seen as a ""digital gold,"" Bitcoin has reacted to global economic stress points. During economic downturns, some investors move towards crypto as a hedge. Conversely, during periods of financial stability, traditional investments appear more attractive.

Recent geopolitical events, especially those involving significant economies, have also impacted crypto. For example, stricter regulatory policies in regions like China and the European Union have led to changes in mining operations and investor behavior. Market experts often highlight that a more regulated market might bring stability and institutional investment in the long run.

Observing these economic indicators and understanding their relationship with the cryptocurrency market can help investors make informed decisions. As the global economy continues to evolve, its influence on crypto markets remains significant.

Blockchain technology has seen significant innovations and increasing adoption across various sectors. These advancements are crucial as they drive the growth and utility of cryptocurrencies, boosting market confidence.

Innovations in blockchain technology have been groundbreaking. One significant development is interoperability protocols, which enhance communication between blockchain networks. This allows for better utility and integration, solving many existing challenges. For example, Polkadot and Cosmos are leading projects in this area.

Another crucial innovation is scalability solutions like Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade aims to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs. Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Optimistic Rollups for Ethereum also address scalability.

Emerging technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) further enhance blockchain security and privacy. These proofs allow for information verification without disclosing any underlying data, boosting user trust and adoption.

Blockchain's application isn't limited to cryptocurrencies. The financial sector has been a frontrunner in its adoption, with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Uniswap and Aave leading the charge. These platforms eliminate intermediaries, offering more accessible financial services.

Blockchain is making waves in industries other than finance. Supply chain management is one area where blockchain provides transparency and traceability, as seen with projects like VeChain.

Another notable sector is healthcare, where blockchain ensures secure and immutable patient records. Companies like Medicalchain are pioneering these efforts. Real estate and gaming have also started leveraging blockchain for transaction transparency and asset tokenization.

These advancements and adoptions show blockchain's growing influence, setting the stage for the cryptocurrency market's potential recovery.

Cryptocurrency regulations are evolving rapidly worldwide, impacting how digital assets are traded and managed. Different countries have unique approaches to cryptocurrency, reflecting a mix of enthusiasm and caution.

Several regions are setting up comprehensive guidelines for cryptocurrency operations. The World Economic Forum reports that China remains one of the strictest, with bans on exchanges, trading, and mining. In contrast, India lifted its previous ban in 2020, and authorities are now crafting more detailed regulations.

The regulatory landscape in the United States is still developing. High-profile cases of crypto scams have attracted the attention of the SEC, which has been actively monitoring initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fraud activities, highlighting the need for tighter rules (Finance Magnates). The fragmented nature of regulations in the U.S. creates complications, as different federal and state agencies may have overlapping jurisdictions (KPMG).

Governments worldwide have varied stances on cryptocurrencies, sometimes reflecting a complex mix of support, caution, and outright opposition. China's strict approach comes from concerns over financial stability and illegal activities. Meanwhile, India's evolving stance includes regulating and exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The United States shows a more nuanced view. Key figures on crypto Twitter suggest that while there's growing support for innovation, there are also calls for stricter control to prevent misuse. Popular analysts and experts often tweet about the need for balanced regulations that protect consumers without stifling technological advancements.

The European Union is another relevant player, with plans to introduce comprehensive regulations to govern digital assets. This includes proposals like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which aims to provide a legal framework to boost consumer protection and market integrity.

Investor sentiment and market dynamics are crucial in shaping the cryptocurrency market. Understanding these factors can provide insights into potential recovery movements and investment opportunities.

Several factors influence investor psychology, including market trends, news, and social media. Positive news about regulatory clarity or technology advancements can boost confidence. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 created optimism among investors.

Conversely, negative news such as regulatory crackdowns or security breaches can lead to panic selling. Social media platforms like Twitter amplify these effects. Influential voices in the crypto space, like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin, often sway market sentiment with their tweets.

Historical trends show that prices generally surge during periods of high optimism. When fear and uncertainty dominate, market value tends to decline. Therefore, tracking these psychological triggers and understanding their impact can help predict market movements.

Institutional investment has become a significant factor in the crypto market dynamics. Large financial institutions and hedge funds bring substantial capital, which can stabilize the market. For example, BlackRock's entry into cryptocurrency investment has led to increased credibility and investor confidence.

Institutional investors also demand higher transparency and regulatory compliance, driving the market towards a more mature and robust infrastructure. Fund managers closely monitor regulatory developments, such as the legal status of stablecoins, which can significantly impact their investment decisions.

Additionally, institutional investments can mitigate market volatility. When big players hold large amounts of cryptocurrency, their long-term investment strategies can provide a cushion against sudden price swings. This can make the market more attractive to retail investors, further contributing to its stability and potential recovery.

Cryptocurrency investing involves various challenges and risks that investors must be aware of. Key concerns include digital assets' security vulnerabilities and the significant volatility that affects market prices.

Security is a significant concern in the cryptocurrency world. Hackers often target crypto exchanges and wallets, leading to significant financial losses. The Celsius Network was among the notable victims of such attacks.

Cold storage is a common solution for keeping assets offline and away from internet threats. Multi-signature wallets add an extra layer of protection, requiring multiple keys to authorize a transaction. Additionally, decentralized exchanges reduce the single points of failure associated with central exchanges.

Investors must also stay vigilant against phishing scams and use strong, unique passwords. Regular updates and employing two-factor authentication can further protect their assets.

Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility. For example, Bitcoin saw its price swing dramatically quickly, attracting high returns and potential huge losses (Investopedia). This makes the market highly speculative, driven by sudden shifts in investor sentiment.

Diversification is one strategy for managing this risk. By holding various coins, investors can reduce their exposure to any asset's price swings. Risk management practices, like setting stop-loss orders, can also help limit potential losses.

Market savvy and staying informed through credible sources and experts on platforms like Twitter are essential. Experts like Michael del Castillo emphasize the need for clear risk limits and sound strategies in navigating these markets.

Cryptocurrencies continue to evolve rapidly, showcasing significant potential in various sectors. The crypto landscape is poised for substantial growth with increased adoption and technological advancements.

Several emerging trends highlight the potential growth areas within the cryptocurrency space. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) continues to attract attention, offering decentralized alternatives to traditional financial systems. This sector shows promise with its ability to provide financial services like lending and borrowing without intermediaries.

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are another significant trend. These digital assets represent ownership of unique items and have found applications in art, gaming, and intellectual property. The NFT market's expansion indicates a growing interest in digital ownership and collectibles.

Web3 development -- the next iteration of the internet -- emphasizes user control over their data. Cryptocurrencies play a vital role here, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) that empower users by giving them more control over their online interactions and data privacy.

Experts provide varying perspectives on the future of cryptocurrencies, yet many remain optimistic. According to a Forbes Advisor report, Ethereum prices are up 41.8% in 2024, reflecting positive market sentiment.

Moreover, the crypto industry's 15-year history of innovation suggests that the future still looks promising, with more opportunities and fewer risks as adoption grows. Moreover, a Bitpanda report estimates the cryptocurrency market will reach $51.5 billion by 2024 and expand further by 2028.

Prominent crypto analysts on Twitter emphasize the continued potential for market growth. Technological advancements and increasing institutional interest will drive future investments. This collective optimism underscores an anticipation of recovery and growth in the foreseeable future.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1723971292/Whats_App_Image_2024_08_18_at_09_29_54_6c90581ef2.jpg,0.3019607843137255
Crypto here to stay,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2849636/crypto-here-to-stay,2024-08-18,Bangkok Post,"Amid a global economic slowdown and geopolitical risks, cryptocurrencies are making a comeback, ranking among the world's top-performing assets in the first seven months of 2024 along with Nvidia, one of the ""Magnificent 7"" tech stocks on the US stock exchange.

Among cryptocurrencies, Binance Coin (BNB), which can be used to trade and pay fees on the Binance exchange, offered the highest return for 2024 of 89.6% as of July 22, followed by Bitcoin at 51.0% and Ethereum 47.5%.

Other top performers include the Nasdaq 100 index at 19.8%, gold 16.4%, MSCI World 14%, oil 13.4%, MSCI Asia 8.21%, MSCI Emerging Markets 6.80% and coal 5.68%.

This year cryptocurrencies received regulatory support, starting with the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) endorsement of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January.

On May 24, the SEC approved the establishment of a spot Ethereum ETF (ETH ETF) and registered the trading of investment units on US stock exchanges, allowing institutional investors, a group with high purchasing power, to invest in this asset.

As a result, the market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies has increased to roughly US$2.5 trillion as of July 3, from around $1 trillion in mid-October last year.

Kavita Gupta, founder and partner at Delta Blockchain Fund, said the launch of spot ETH ETF could have major implications for other altcoins.

""The launch of the ETH ETF was a major development for the space and will kick-start the next altcoin rally, despite the Bitcoin dominance we have seen thus far,"" she said.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts expect four more coins have the potential to be endorsed for spot ETFs, which could attract institutional investors to invest more in the crypto market in second half of the year.

BNB'S UTILITY

BNB, issued by the Binance exchange, was created in 2017 as a utility token for discounted trading fees before it was expanded to numerous applications on a wide range of platforms. It is used to pay transaction fees on Binance.com, Binance DEX and Binance Chain.

BNB can also be used for payments on Monetha and HTC; to book accommodation at sites such as TravelbyBit, Trip.io and Travala.com; to buy music or game rewards; to pay for online services at BitTorrent, Canva and Storm; or to take out a loan at ETHLend or invest at Moeda.

Every quarter, Binance uses one-fifth of its profits to repurchase and permanently destroy or ""burn"" BNB held in its treasury.

At the time of writing, BNB had a market cap of more than $87 billion, ranking behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum and USD Tether.

Sanjay Popli, chief executive of Cryptomind Advisory and co-founder of Cryptomind Group Holdings, said BNB has been a popular coin for a long time. However, over the past few years, some investors were concerned about how much the Binance Exchange and BNB coin would be affected by the US SEC's investigation.

Changpeng Zhao, a former chief executive of Binance Exchange, was sentenced to four months in prison by a US court on April 30 after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws.

Zhao is scheduled to be released from prison this month. Though he is no longer an executive at Binance, he is an important figure behind the scenes, leading investors to speculate on the price of BNB, said Mr Popli.

BNB coin may also benefit from Binance Launchpad, the exclusive token launch platform of Binance that assists blockchain startups in raising funds for new projects.

Investors prefer holding BNB coins when the crypto market is active because many new coins are expected to list on the Binance platform, and they will receive free coins from Launchpool according to conditions, he said.

SECOND-HALF OUTLOOK

Mr Popli said interesting coins for the second half of the year include NEAR Protocol, which offers backups related to artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

He also singled out Render, a distributed graphics processing unit rendering network that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.

Mr Popli said Worldcoin is designed to become the world's largest privacy-preserving human identity and financial network, giving ownership to anyone.

Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralised, scalable applications, while meme coins are another interesting development this year, he said.

SPOT ETF POTENTIAL

According to Bitkub Academy, part of Thailand's leading cryptocurrency exchange, four coins have the opportunity to be endorsed as the next spot ETFs, following Bitcoin and Ethereum.

First is Solana because it has a high market cap, ranked fourth in the crypto market with high liquidity and reliability, according to the academy.

The SEC recently decided to abandon an effort to have a court determine if 10 crypto assets, including Solana and Cardano, should be designated securities in the case against Binance. This move supports Solana eventually being endorsed, said Bitkub Academy.

The regulator filed charges against Binance in June 2023 for breaching federal securities regulations, and included various tokens from Binance's listings in its claim.

These tokens comprised Cardano, Solana, The Sandbox, Polygon and Axie Infinity. Other tokens labelled as securities in this context included Binance USD, Binance Coin, Decentraland, Coti and Cosmos.

Another coin that could be endorsed for a spot ETF is Ripple (XRP), which ranks fifth by market cap.

Similar to Solana, the SEC accused Ripple and its executives of raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered asset offering of the XRP token.

Ripple recently expressed its confidence that the judge will take a ""fair approach"" and that legal clarity on XRP is ""here to stay"".

Litecoin has been on the market for a long time. It is considered similar to Bitcoin because it uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism to process transactions, a decentralised mechanism that is considered safe from attacks. However, this coin has a low market value.

A final option, according to Bitkub Academy, is Dogecoin (DOGE), which was created for fun as an internet meme.

DOGE is considered similar to Bitcoin because it uses the PoS mechanism. It also has a high market cap, ranking sixth in the cryptocurrency market. The coin has a decentralised distribution of coin holders and quite good decentralisation properties, according to the academy.

TEMPER YOUR OPTIMISM

Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, said there won't be a ""long list of crypto ETFs"".

Despite the recent launch of spot ETH ETFs, he said it is unlikely this will open the door to funds that track other crypto assets such as Solana or Polygon.

""I don't think we're going to see a long list of crypto ETFs,"" Mr Mitchnick said in a conversation with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

""If you think of Bitcoin, today it represents about 55% of the market cap. ETH is at 18%. The next plausible investible asset is at 3%. It's just not close to being at that threshold or track record of maturity, liquidity, etc.""

That said, it is ""increasingly clear"" that crypto as an asset class is ""not going away"", and there will likely be opportunities for firms like BlackRock to get more involved in the market.

Competitor VanEck, for instance, recently filed to launch a Solana ETF, which analysts see as a long shot for approval.

Mr Mitchnick said while there isn't ""full-blown clarity"" from regulators, the US SEC has been clear that it wants to draw the line somewhere. For instance, the regulator is unlikely to approve spot ETH ETFs with staking components, he said.

BlackRock is largely credited with rekindling interest in launching spot Bitcoin ETFs when it filed to launch the product in June 2023.

The SEC had been reluctant to approve these investment products for more than a decade, often citing the potential for market manipulation and surveillance concerns.

The iShares Bitcoin ETF filing changed the game when it included a market observation agreement that addressed those risks, said Mr Mitchnick.

BULLISH OUTLOOK

Bitcoin prices climbed more than 11% in July, finishing the month above $67,700. ETH prices dropped 3.4% in July to close out the month at $3,272.

Among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Ripple was the best July performer with a 26.9% gain.

Toncoin was the worst performer for the month, but remains up 21.5% overall over the past three months.

Earlier this month, Bitcoin prices plunged below $60,000, attributed to risk aversion in global markets that saddled the digital asset with its heftiest weekly loss since the collapse of the FTX Exchange in 2022.

The decline came amid a global stock sell-off, reflecting concerns about the economic outlook and questions over whether heavy investment in AI will live up to the hype surrounding the technology.

Geopolitical tensions are also rising in the Middle East, adding to investors' skittishness.

Investors are upbeat about reports that Morgan Stanley will give thousands of financial advisors the green light to solicit eligible clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs as soon as next week, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In a memo, the company told its group of 15,000 advisors they can offer some clients the chance to buy either BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust or the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, as reported earlier by CNBC.

Morgan Stanley's decision may pave the way for other banks that have been reticent to offer digital assets to consider tapping the sector, noted the report.

The industry is also hoping the upcoming US presidential election will lead to a more crypto-friendly White House. Once a critic of the industry, former president and 2024 Republican candidate Donald Trump has now become a cheerleader of Bitcoin.

Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris has not issued a digital asset policy.

""Obviously, if we see a Republican administration come in, it might be more bullish for crypto more broadly, which is fantastic,"" said Nic Roberts-Huntley, chief executive of crypto startup Concrete.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20240819/c1_2849636_240819060458_700.jpg,0.2941176470588236
Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work: Which is Better?,https://sfctoday.com/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work-which-is-better/,2024-09-01,sfctoday.com,"The debate between Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) has been a central topic in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for years. These two consensus mechanisms are the most widely used methods for validating transactions and securing blockchain networks. While both have their merits, they differ significantly in terms of how they achieve consensus, their environmental impact, security, and scalability.

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, understanding the differences between PoS and PoW, along with their respective strengths and weaknesses, is crucial for anyone interested in the future of blockchain technology. This article provides an in-depth comparison of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work, exploring their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages, and the ongoing debate over which is better.

Proof of Work (PoW) is the original consensus mechanism used by the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin whitepaper as a way to secure the network and validate transactions without the need for a central authority. PoW works by requiring participants (known as miners) to solve complex mathematical puzzles, known as cryptographic hashes, to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain.

The puzzles that miners solve are computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power and energy consumption. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets the right to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) and any transaction fees associated with the block. This process is what makes PoW-based blockchains secure, as it would be extremely costly and difficult for a malicious actor to gain control of the network.

The difficulty of these puzzles is adjusted over time to ensure that blocks are added at a consistent rate. As more miners join the network, the difficulty increases, requiring more computational power to solve the puzzles. This mechanism also ensures that the network remains decentralized, as no single miner or group of miners can easily dominate the network.

One of the main advantages of PoW is its proven track record of security. Bitcoin, which operates on a PoW consensus mechanism, has been running securely since its inception in 2009, with no major security breaches. This long-standing security record has made PoW the gold standard for blockchain security, particularly for decentralized and trustless systems.

PoW also provides a high level of decentralization, which is one of the core principles of blockchain technology. Because the process of mining is open to anyone with the necessary computational power, PoW networks are resistant to centralization. This decentralization makes it difficult for any single entity to gain control over the network, enhancing its security and integrity.

Another advantage of PoW is its resistance to certain types of attacks, such as the Sybil attack, where an attacker creates multiple fake identities to gain control of the network. In PoW, each identity (or miner) must expend significant resources to participate, making it prohibitively expensive to carry out such an attack.

Despite its strengths, PoW has several significant disadvantages, particularly in terms of environmental impact and scalability. The most commonly cited issue with PoW is its energy consumption. Because PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles, it necessitates the use of vast amounts of electricity. As the network grows and the difficulty of mining increases, so too does the energy required to maintain the network.

This high energy consumption has led to widespread criticism of PoW-based cryptocurrencies, particularly in the context of climate change and environmental sustainability. Bitcoin mining, for example, is estimated to consume as much electricity as some small countries, leading to concerns about the long-term viability of PoW-based networks in an increasingly energy-conscious world.

Another disadvantage of PoW is its scalability limitations. Because PoW relies on solving complex puzzles, the time it takes to add new blocks to the blockchain is relatively slow, limiting the number of transactions the network can process per second. This has led to congestion and high transaction fees on networks like Bitcoin during periods of high demand. While various scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, have been proposed, they have yet to fully address the inherent limitations of PoW.

Finally, PoW has been criticized for its tendency towards centralization in practice. While PoW is designed to be decentralized, the high costs associated with mining (such as purchasing and maintaining specialized hardware and paying for electricity) have led to the emergence of large mining pools. These pools consolidate hashing power, potentially giving a few entities disproportionate influence over the network.

Proof of Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism that was introduced as a more energy-efficient and scalable solution compared to PoW. PoS was first implemented in the cryptocurrency Peercoin in 2012 and has since been adopted by several other blockchains, including Ethereum 2.0, which is transitioning from PoW to PoS.

In a PoS system, validators (often referred to as stakers) are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to ""stake"" as collateral. The more coins a validator stakes, the higher their chances of being selected to validate a block and earn rewards. However, the selection process is typically randomized to prevent wealthier participants from always being chosen.

Unlike PoW, which requires participants to expend significant computational power, PoS relies on the economic stake of participants to secure the network. This eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and reduces the environmental impact of the network. Validators in a PoS system are incentivized to act honestly, as they stand to lose their staked coins if they attempt to validate fraudulent transactions.

One of the most significant advantages of PoS is its energy efficiency. Because PoS does not require participants to solve complex puzzles, it consumes far less electricity than PoW. This makes PoS a more environmentally friendly option, which is particularly important as concerns about the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies continue to grow.

PoS also offers improved scalability compared to PoW. Because validators do not need to perform energy-intensive calculations, new blocks can be added to the blockchain more quickly, allowing the network to process more transactions per second. This increased throughput makes PoS networks better suited to handle high volumes of transactions, reducing congestion and transaction fees.

Another advantage of PoS is its reduced barrier to entry. In a PoS system, participants do not need expensive hardware or access to cheap electricity to become validators. Instead, they simply need to hold and stake the network's native cryptocurrency. This opens up participation to a broader range of individuals, promoting greater decentralization and inclusivity.

Additionally, PoS provides a built-in mechanism for punishing malicious behavior. Validators who attempt to validate fraudulent transactions can lose their staked coins, a process known as ""slashing."" This economic incentive encourages honest behavior and enhances the security of the network.

Despite its advantages, PoS is not without its drawbacks. One of the primary criticisms of PoS is that it can lead to wealth concentration and centralization. In a PoS system, those who hold more coins have a higher probability of being selected as validators and earning rewards. Over time, this can lead to a situation where the wealthiest participants accumulate even more wealth, potentially giving them undue influence over the network.

Another concern with PoS is the potential for ""nothing at stake"" attacks. In PoW, miners must expend real resources (such as electricity) to participate in the network, giving them a strong incentive to support the longest, most valid chain. In PoS, however, validators do not incur significant costs for creating blocks, which could theoretically lead to a situation where they support multiple chains at once, undermining the security of the network. To address this, many PoS systems implement penalties for validators who attempt to validate conflicting blocks, but the issue remains a point of contention.

PoS is also relatively new compared to PoW, and as such, it has not been as extensively tested in practice. While several PoS-based cryptocurrencies have operated successfully for years, they have not faced the same level of scrutiny or attacks as PoW-based networks like Bitcoin. As PoS continues to gain adoption, it will be important to monitor its performance and security under real-world conditions.

Finally, PoS systems can be more complex to implement and understand compared to PoW. The selection of validators, staking mechanisms, and slashing penalties all add layers of complexity that can be difficult for both developers and users to navigate. This complexity could pose a barrier to adoption, particularly for those new to cryptocurrency.

One of the most high-profile examples of a blockchain transitioning from PoW to PoS is Ethereum. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was originally launched with a PoW consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin's. However, due to the scalability limitations and environmental concerns associated with PoW, the Ethereum community decided to transition to PoS through a series of upgrades collectively known as Ethereum 2.0.

The transition to Ethereum 2.0 has been a multi-year process, involving the introduction of a new PoS-based blockchain called the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain operates alongside the original Ethereum PoW chain, and once fully merged, it will replace PoW entirely. This transition is seen as a critical step in Ethereum's evolution, addressing key issues such as scalability, energy consumption, and network security.

The shift to PoS is expected to reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by over 99%, making it one of the most environmentally friendly blockchain networks. Additionally, PoS is anticipated to improve Ethereum's scalability, enabling the network to process thousands of transactions per second, compared to the current rate of around 15 transactions per second under PoW.

However, the transition to PoS has not been without challenges. Delays in the rollout of Ethereum 2.0, concerns about centralization, and uncertainty about the impact on miners and stakeholders have all been points of contention within the Ethereum community. Nevertheless, the move to PoS is seen as a necessary evolution for Ethereum, setting the stage for the future of decentralized applications and blockchain technology.

The question of whether Proof of Stake or Proof of Work is better ultimately depends on the specific goals and requirements of a blockchain network. Both consensus mechanisms have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them should be informed by the trade-offs each entails.

Proof of Work is a time-tested and highly secure consensus mechanism that has proven its resilience over more than a decade of use in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its decentralized nature and resistance to certain types of attacks make it a strong choice for networks that prioritize security and decentralization. However, its high energy consumption and scalability limitations are significant drawbacks, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability.

Proof of Stake, on the other hand, offers a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to PoW. Its lower barriers to entry and reduced environmental impact make it an attractive option for networks focused on inclusivity and sustainability. However, concerns about centralization, wealth concentration, and the relative novelty of the technology mean that PoS is not without its risks.

In practice, the decision between PoS and PoW will depend on the specific needs of the blockchain project, the preferences of its community, and the regulatory and environmental context in which it operates. Some networks may choose to implement hybrid models that combine elements of both PoS and PoW, while others may explore entirely new consensus mechanisms that address the shortcomings of both.

As the cryptocurrency and blockchain space continues to evolve, the debate between PoS and PoW will likely remain a central topic of discussion. While there is no definitive answer to which is better, the ongoing experimentation and innovation in the field will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each consensus mechanism.

Proof of Stake and Proof of Work represent two fundamentally different approaches to achieving consensus in blockchain networks. While PoW has been the dominant consensus mechanism for many years, the rise of PoS reflects a growing recognition of the need for more energy-efficient and scalable solutions. Both PoS and PoW have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them should be made based on the specific goals and priorities of the network in question.

As the blockchain industry continues to mature, the competition and coexistence between PoS and PoW will likely drive further innovation, leading to new consensus mechanisms and improvements to existing ones. Whether one will eventually emerge as the clear superior choice remains to be seen, but what is certain is that both will continue to play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralized technologies.",https://sfctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Proof-of-Stake-vs.-Proof-of-Work-Which-is-Better-1.jpg,0.3960784313725489
Best Ethereum ETFs: Top funds for buying Ethereum,https://www.kansas.com/living/personal-finance/article292421484.html,2024-09-13,The Wichita Eagle,"Traders who want to buy and sell the cryptocurrency Ethereum can now use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to do so. The best Ethereum ETFs make it easy to trade the second-most-popular cryptocurrency through a traditional broker rather than more complex cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETFs in May 2024, following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. Ethereum ETFs began trading in July, and by using an Ethereum ETF, traders can purchase the cryptocurrency without taking custody of the coin or working with cryptocurrency exchanges with sometimes dubious security.

Here are some of the best Ethereum ETFs, including their performance and annual fees.

Top Ethereum ETFs

Source: ETF.com. Data as of Sept. 11, 2024.

*On Jan. 1, 2026, this fund will start charging 0.25 percent annually.

**On Feb. 1, 2025, this fund will start charging 0.19 percent annually.

These spot EThereum ETFs track the price of the cryptocurrency on the same percentage basis, if they trade at different fund prices. If Ethereum rises 2 percent, these funds should rise a similar amount. So these ETFs have all performed comparably since approval.

So which is the best fund for you? Since their performance is largely the same and they own the same underlying asset, the best ETF is one that offers you the lowest expense ratio. It's a similar situation with index funds that track major indexes such as the S&P 500. If the funds track the same index, then your best pick is the fund that charges the lower costs.

Much like when new Bitcoin funds were offered, a few of these new Ethereum funds are offering no expense ratio for a limited period. A few fund managers may be trying to build up assets and investors quickly, but those fees will eventually revert after an initial period of low fees expires.

The ETFs' fees are more than competitive with trading Ethereum directly at most brokerages and crypto exchanges, meaning it's easier and cheaper to buy your cryptocurrency through a fund. You'll be able to trade with an existing broker without the hassle of a new crypto account.

Should you invest in Ethereum ETFs?

The advent of Ethereum ETFs doesn't mean that the popular cryptocurrency is a buy, of course, just that it's now easier and cheaper to do so. But the funds do offer a good way for traders to wager on the digital currency if they were already planning to do that, while avoiding some of the security headache of safeguarding and securing cryptocurrency.

Those thinking of investing in Ethereum should consider what SEC chief Gary Gensler said in January when his agency approved Bitcoin ETFs. He warned: ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.""

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has been tremendously volatile since it debuted, making it an attractive trading vehicle for skilled traders. It's even done well for those who have bought and held a stake. But volatility can be rough on inexperienced traders, leading them to buy high and sell low, as the volatility scares them and then saps their resolve to continue holding when the coin hits a low.

Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not backed by the hard assets or cash flow of an underlying entity. The only thing that supports its price is the sentiment of traders, who believe they can sell it to another trader for more money later. This type of strategy is what investing experts call the ""greater fool theory of investing,"" as traders only make money selling an asset to someone else who is more optimistic about its prospects and price potential than they are.

For this reason and others, legendary investor Warren Buffett has stayed clear of cryptocurrency, and has warned about others such as Bitcoin, which he called ""probably rat poison squared.""

Where can you buy the best Ethereum ETFs?

Ethereum ETFs are typically available at any broker that allows customers to buy stocks or funds on a major U.S. exchange. The best brokers for stock trading let investors buy any available ETF with no commission, so you can trade in and out of a position at a low cost.

It's a similar situation with index funds that track major indexes such as the S&P 500. If the funds track the same index, then your best pick is the fund that charges the lower costs.

Much like when new Bitcoin funds were offered, a few of these new Ethereum funds are offering no expense ratio for a limited period. A few fund managers may be trying to build up assets and investors quickly, but those fees will eventually revert after an initial period of low fees expires.

The ETFs' fees are more than competitive with trading Ethereum directly at most brokerages and crypto exchanges, meaning it's easier and cheaper to buy your cryptocurrency through a fund. You'll be able to trade with an existing broker without the hassle of a new crypto account.

Should you invest in Ethereum ETFs?

The advent of Ethereum ETFs doesn't mean that the popular cryptocurrency is a buy, of course, just that it's now easier and cheaper to do so. But the funds do offer a good way for traders to wager on the digital currency if they were already planning to do that, while avoiding some of the security headache of safeguarding and securing cryptocurrency.

Those thinking of investing in Ethereum should consider what SEC chief Gary Gensler said in January when his agency approved Bitcoin ETFs. He warned: ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.""

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has been tremendously volatile since it debuted, making it an attractive trading vehicle for skilled traders. It's even done well for those who have bought and held a stake. But volatility can be rough on inexperienced traders, leading them to buy high and sell low, as the volatility scares them and then saps their resolve to continue holding when the coin hits a low.

Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not backed by the hard assets or cash flow of an underlying entity. The only thing that supports its price is the sentiment of traders, who believe they can sell it to another trader for more money later. This type of strategy is what investing experts call the ""greater fool theory of investing,"" as traders only make money selling an asset to someone else who is more optimistic about its prospects and price potential than they are.

For this reason and others, legendary investor Warren Buffett has stayed clear of cryptocurrency, and has warned about others such as Bitcoin, which he called ""probably rat poison squared.""

Where can you buy the best Ethereum ETFs?

Ethereum ETFs are typically available at any broker that allows customers to buy stocks or funds on a major U.S. exchange. The best brokers for stock trading let investors buy any available ETF with no commission, so you can trade in and out of a position at a low cost.

Bottom line

The ability to trade spot Ethereum ETFs makes it easy and cheap for traders to take a stake in the digital currency at their usual broker without needing a specialized account at a crypto exchange.

Those thinking of investing in Ethereum should consider what SEC chief Gary Gensler said in January when his agency approved Bitcoin ETFs. He warned: ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.""

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has been tremendously volatile since it debuted, making it an attractive trading vehicle for skilled traders. It's even done well for those who have bought and held a stake. But volatility can be rough on inexperienced traders, leading them to buy high and sell low, as the volatility scares them and then saps their resolve to continue holding when the coin hits a low.

Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not backed by the hard assets or cash flow of an underlying entity. The only thing that supports its price is the sentiment of traders, who believe they can sell it to another trader for more money later. This type of strategy is what investing experts call the ""greater fool theory of investing,"" as traders only make money selling an asset to someone else who is more optimistic about its prospects and price potential than they are.

For this reason and others, legendary investor Warren Buffett has stayed clear of cryptocurrency, and has warned about others such as Bitcoin, which he called ""probably rat poison squared.""

Where can you buy the best Ethereum ETFs?

Ethereum ETFs are typically available at any broker that allows customers to buy stocks or funds on a major U.S. exchange. The best brokers for stock trading let investors buy any available ETF with no commission, so you can trade in and out of a position at a low cost.

Bottom line

The ability to trade spot Ethereum ETFs makes it easy and cheap for traders to take a stake in the digital currency at their usual broker without needing a specialized account at a crypto exchange. These funds may make Ethereum a more attractive option for traders, perhaps leading to greater liquidity and acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fcgqcu/picture292421039/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/36b4c38a-6fc0-438d-a5ce-447253ac414a,0.3176470588235294
"History of Crypto Airdrops: Purpose, Notable Examples, and Impact on the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem",https://coinpaper.com/5135/history-of-crypto-airdrops,2024-08-22,Coinpaper,"Cryptocurrency airdrops have been a crucial part of the crypto ecosystem since the early days of Bitcoin. Airdrops are campaigns where tokens or coins are distributed for free to numerous wallet addresses, usually to promote new projects. This tactic attracts attention and helps build a large user base quickly. Early adopters often find these airdrops valuable, as they can gain significant returns if the token appreciates.

One of the earliest examples of a successful airdrop was for OmiseGO (OMG) in 2017. Holders of Ethereum received OMG tokens, which surged in value, creating significant buzz in the crypto community. In 2020, Uniswap's airdrop of its UNI token set a new standard. Every wallet that had used Uniswap's decentralized exchange was airdropped 400 UNI tokens, which generated excitement and underscored the importance of airdrops in user engagement.

Today, discussions on platforms like Twitter highlight the vital role of airdrops in the DeFi space. Experts like Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin have commented on how airdrops help in fair distribution and community building. Airdrops remain a powerful tool for new and existing projects to foster adoption and reward early supporters.

Crypto airdrops date back to the early days of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's creator, distributed the first cryptocurrency by mining blocks and rewarding early miners. This mechanism was a precursor to the more structured airdrops we see today.

2014 Auroracoin set a notable example by distributing free tokens to Iceland's citizens. This move aimed at promoting wider adoption and decentralization. Airdrops like this one allowed people to gain cryptocurrency without buying or mining it.

Airdrops serve many purposes: marketing, decentralization, and rewarding loyal users. Projects hope to raise awareness and attract a broader audience by giving away tokens. The tokens can be traded or held as investments, adding value to users' crypto portfolios.

Here is a list of some notable airdrops:

Experts on Twitter often discuss the benefits and drawbacks of airdrops. For example, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, tweeted that if done correctly, airdrops can lead to increased adoption. Similarly, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, mentioned that airdrops can help decentralize token ownership.

These airdrops have significant impacts. They help build vibrant communities, foster financial sustainability, and contribute to the ongoing growth of the crypto ecosystem. By distributing tokens widely, projects can achieve a more decentralized and secure network.

Understanding the inner workings of airdrops is essential for anyone looking to participate in or conduct these token distributions. Key aspects include their types, eligibility criteria, and technical execution.

Several methods are used for conducting airdrops. Popular types include snapshot-based airdrops and task-based airdrops.

Snapshot-based airdrops distribute tokens to holders based on a snapshot of balances taken at a specific time. This method rewards users who hold tokens at the snapshot time, promoting loyalty.

Task-based airdrops require users to complete specific actions, such as following social media accounts or referring friends. This helps in marketing and spreading awareness.

Exclusive airdrops are also offered for select groups or individuals, such as early adopters or testers. These airdrops sometimes reward influencers or significant contributors within the ecosystem.

Eligibility for airdrops often depends on several criteria.

Activity-based criteria require users to be active participants in a project's ecosystem. For instance, they might need to transact a certain amount of the native token or hold it for a specific period.

Geographical restrictions can also play a role. Some airdrops are limited to users in certain countries due to regulatory reasons. Allowlists are sometimes employed, where users sign up and meet specific conditions before qualifying.

Distribution methods vary. Some projects send tokens directly to users' wallets, while others require claiming through a smart contract or centralized platform. This ensures that only engaged and interested users receive the tokens.

Executing an airdrop involves several technical steps.

Smart contracts are commonly used to automate the process, ensuring fair and transparent distribution without manual intervention. These contracts typically manage the list of eligible wallets and the number of tokens to be distributed.

Snapshot tools capture the state of the blockchain at a specific point in time. This helps identify eligible wallets for snapshot-based airdrops. Another technical aspect is token minting, where new tokens are created specifically for the airdrop.

Security measures are vital. Protecting the airdrop process from exploitation, such as multiple claims from the same user, is crucial. Implementing anti-bot mechanisms and verifying wallet authenticity can help maintain the integrity of the airdrop.

By understanding these mechanics, individuals and projects can better navigate the complex landscape of crypto airdrops.

Crypto airdrops serve as potent tools for marketing and community building in cryptocurrency. By distributing tokens for free, projects can rapidly attract many users and create buzz.

For example, Uniswap's airdrop of UNI tokens generated significant excitement and user participation. Meanwhile, Sidney Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, mentioned that airdrops can serve as a ""powerful catalyst for user engagement.""

Token Distribution

Airdrops provide a way to distribute tokens widely without the need for large marketing budgets. This method gets the tokens into users' wallets and encourages them to explore the project.

Community Building

Giving away tokens can help projects build a loyal community from the ground up. Users who receive tokens are more likely to stay engaged and support the project's growth. This community can help spread the word, increasing the project's reach.

Marketing Strategy

Many startups use airdrops as part of their marketing strategy to boost visibility. Coinbound says successful airdrops can set an initial token value and rapidly build a community.

Real-World Impact

Cryptocurrency experts on Twitter often discuss the impact of airdrops on community building. A recent thread highlighted how airdrops have democratized token access and helped smaller investors participate in the crypto ecosystem.

Airdrops continue to evolve as a strategic marketing and community-building tool, shaping user adoption and engagement dynamics in the crypto space.

The regulatory landscape of crypto airdrops is crucial for understanding legal compliance and the impact of geopolitical factors on these token distributions.

Regulatory scrutiny has increased as the crypto industry grows. Airdrops were once seen as simple token distributions but now face stringent legal and compliance requirements. Projects must ensure their campaigns comply with local and international laws to avoid penalties.

For example, the SEC in the United States has been paying close attention to how airdrops are conducted. They consider aspects such as whether an airdrop constitutes emphasize security under U.S. law. CryptoLenz highlights the need for projects to navigate evolving regulations to avoid legal issues. Failure to comply can lead to significant financial and operational setbacks.

Experts emphasize the importance of legal consultations. Jake Chervinsky, a prominent lawyer in the crypto space, often tweets about the legal complexities of airdrops. Legal advice can help projects avoid missteps that attract regulatory attention and potential lawsuits.

Different countries have different regulations regarding crypto airdrops. Geopolitical factors significantly affect how these campaigns are conducted and received.

For instance, strict regulations in China ban most crypto activities, including airdrops. On the other hand, countries like Singapore and Switzerland have more crypto-friendly regulations.

The evolution of the crypto regulatory landscape reveals that global perspectives can vary widely, impacting how projects approach airdrops in various regions. Some regions focus on investor protection, while others aim to foster innovation.

Crypto Twitter often buzzes with discussions on geopolitical impacts. Recently, influencers debated how Russia's regulatory stance could affect global airdrop strategies. These conversations provide insights into how major geopolitical events and policies shape the crypto landscape.

Understanding these factors is essential for navigating crypto airdrops' complex regulatory environment.

Several crypto airdrops have made headlines due to their success or failure. These campaigns often serve as case studies for current and future projects.

One of the first notable airdrops was Auroracoin in 2014, which aimed to distribute digital currency to all Icelandic citizens. The widespread media attention helped increase awareness of cryptocurrencies.

Uniswap's airdrop in 2020 distributed UNI tokens to early users. Each participant received 400 UNI tokens worth around $1,200. This airdrop encouraged long-term engagement with the platform and rewarded loyal users.

Another successful example is Stellar (XLM), which distributed over $16 billion in XLM tokens to Blockchain.com wallet users in 2018, increasing its user base and liquidity.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had a high-impact airdrop in 2017 when it split from Bitcoin. Holders of Bitcoin received an equal amount of BCH, leading to a rapid increase in BCH adoption.

Not all airdrops succeed. Auroracoin, despite its initial success, struggled with long-term value and adoption. Market interest waned, and its value decreased significantly over time.

Oyster Pearl (PRL), which airdropped its tokens in 2018, suffered a severe blow when the founder exploited a smart contract to mint millions of new tokens, losing investor trust.

BitClave (CAT) had an ambitious plan to reward users for their data with tokens. Despite the large airdrop, the project failed to deliver its promises. The token quickly lost value, affecting investor confidence.

ChainLink (LINK) was criticized for its 2017 airdrop. Many believed that the tokens dropped were too small in number to significantly impact their holders.

Lessons from these failed campaigns highlight the importance of a well-executed plan and ongoing support for the token to maintain value and trust.

Crypto airdrops have significantly influenced the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They are a marketing strategy that helps projects gain traction and create awareness.

Airdrops increase community engagement by offering free tokens to early users. This encourages individuals to participate in the project's growth, fostering loyalty and creating an active user base.

Airdrops can democratize token distribution by providing free tokens. For example, early adopters of Auroracoin received tokens, making the project more accessible to a wider audience.

Airdrops often lead to increased liquidity and higher trading volumes. When recipients trade or hold these tokens, it enhances market depth, which can attract more investors.

While beneficial, airdrops also carry risks. Users might sell tokens quickly, leading to price volatility. There's also the challenge of discerning worthwhile airdrops from less valuable ones.

Projects like Ethereum and Solana have used airdrops to build vital ecosystems. For instance, Ethereum's early airdrops offered tokens that are now highly valued, contributing to its widespread adoption.

Crypto Twitter and market experts often discuss airdrops' impact. Renowned analyst @CryptoJake recently tweeted, ""Airdrops are a game-changer in crypto adoption"".

Overall, airdrops have a multifaceted impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, driving engagement and adoption.

Crypto airdrops have been subject to their share of challenges and controversies. One major issue is token dumping, where recipients quickly sell off their tokens, causing a sudden price drop. This behavior undermines the long-term value of projects and is of concern to many developers.

Another significant problem is the rise of scams and fraudulent airdrops. Scammers often create fake projects to lure users into providing sensitive information or even direct payments, leading to growing skepticism among potential recipients.

Regulatory scrutiny is also becoming a pressing concern. Governments worldwide are examining the legality and implications of airdrops, with some suggesting stricter regulations. This increased scrutiny creates uncertainty and can impact the growth of legitimate projects.

Experts on Crypto Twitter frequently discuss these issues. Analyst @CryptoKing notes, ""Token dumping is a real issue. It damages trust and long-term engagement,"" highlighting the widespread concern. Additionally, many users worry about the sheer number of scam airdrops appearing daily.

Anti-Sybil strategies are another area of controversy. Designed to prevent users from gaming the system by creating multiple accounts, these strategies often need to be revised, allowing savvy users to exploit the system. More robust methods are needed to tackle this challenge.

Despite promises, many airdropped tokens still need to deliver substantial value. For example, within the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, quick profits and the lack of sustainable growth are often cited as significant drawbacks, as noted in discussions about airdrop effectiveness.

These challenges underscore the need for better regulation, robust strategies, and continued vigilance from developers and users to maintain the integrity and value of crypto airdrops.

The future of crypto airdrops is centered on innovation and the introduction of new technologies and methods. Experts predict evolving trends and significant potential for growth in this area.

Innovation is critical in the realm of crypto airdrops. One emerging trend is cross-chain airdrops, which allow tokens to be distributed across different blockchain networks. This trend increases reach and invites more participants into the ecosystem.

Community engagement strategies are also transforming. Projects now focus on rewarding active community members through participation incentives, ensuring that tokens end up in the hands of those who contribute to the project's success. Creative distribution methods like interactive tasks or puzzles are also becoming popular.

Another notable trend is the integration of DeFi platforms. By leveraging decentralized finance, airdrops can attract liquidity providers and other stakeholders. Projects like Linea, Eclipse, Fuel, and Scroll are examples to watch out for in 2024.

Market experts foresee a bright future for crypto airdrops. Many predict an increase in their frequency and value. In 2023 alone, the top 50 crypto airdrops distributed over $4.5 billion tokens. This trend is expected to continue as more projects embrace airdrops for token distribution.

Another potential is regulatory clarity. As regulations become more defined, projects may feel more confident executing airdrops, potentially leading to larger distributions.

Social media and community dynamics will continue to play a crucial role. Influential figures on platforms like Twitter often drive significant attention to upcoming airdrops. Founders and analysts on crypto Twitter frequently highlight how these events benefit both the project and the participants.

New projects like Grass, Karak, Initia, Berachain, Zora, and Farcaster are also expected to participate in upcoming airdrops, proving that this distribution method is here to stay.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1724314677/cp6225_crypto_airdrops_generic_cover_v_6_1_2992d9c5_03c1_473c_92e8_b3a2287bcd0f_c6383d4b2f.png,0.584313725490196
"Legal framework for taxing cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, by Kayode Ajulo |",https://theeagleonline.com.ng/legal-framework-for-taxing-cryptocurrencies-in-nigeria-by-kayode-ajulo/,2024-08-20,Th Eagle Online,"A cryptocurrency (also known as virtual currency), is a type of decentralised digital currency that investors can buy and sell along the blockchain. Unlike banknotes or minted coins that have tangible, physical forms, cryptocurrencies can only be accessed using computers and other electronic devices.

While there are thousands of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance coin, Dogecoin, they all tend to work in similar ways.

The rapid growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide, have presented significant regulatory and taxation challenges for governments, including Nigeria. As one of the countries with a burgeoning cryptocurrency market, Nigeria has grappled with the task of developing a comprehensive legal and taxation framework, to address the unique aspects of this emerging asset class.

Overview of current legal framework

The legal framework for the taxation of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria is still evolving, as the Nigerian Government has not yet enacted specific legislation to address the taxation of cryptocurrency transactions. However, there are some existing laws and regulations that can be applied to the taxation of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. Here's an overview of the current legal framework:

1. Central Bank of Nigeria Regulations: The Central Bank of Nigeria has issued several circulars and directives regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency activities in Nigeria. In 2021, the CBN prohibited banks and other financial institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. However, the CBN has not explicitly addressed the taxation of cryptocurrencies in its regulations.

2. Income Tax Laws: The relevant income tax laws in Nigeria, such as the Companies Income Tax Act LFN, 2004 and the Personal Income Tax Act LFN, 2004, do not specifically mention cryptocurrencies. However, the Nigerian tax authorities can potentially consider cryptocurrency transactions as either business income or capital gains, depending on the nature of the transaction and the taxpayer's activities.

3. Value Added Tax Act: The Value Added Tax Act (CAP. V1 LFN, 2004) in Nigeria does not provide specific guidance on the VAT treatment of cryptocurrency transactions. The Nigerian tax authorities may consider applying VAT to certain cryptocurrency-related services, such as cryptocurrency exchange services or the sale of digital assets.

4. Regulatory Guidance: The Nigerian government, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission, has issued some guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies. In 2019, the FIRS released a public notice stating that gains from cryptocurrency transactions should be subject to capital gains tax. The SEC has also provided guidance on the classification and regulation of certain cryptocurrency-based assets, which may have implications for their taxation.

It is however important to note that the legal framework for the taxation of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria is still evolving, and there may be additional developments or clarifications from the Nigerian government in the future. Taxpayers and businesses involved in cryptocurrency activities in Nigeria should stay informed about any updates or changes in the relevant laws and regulations.

Legality and legal status of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria

Legal or Illegal?

There is no legislation in Nigeria that expressly bans the usage of cryptocurrencies. In normative systems such as law, without an express prohibition of a conduct (whether an act or omission) by a code, such a conduct is permitted. Its application in legal philosophy is that an action is permitted if it is not prohibited. In criminal law, this is known as the principle of nullum crimen sine lege (Latin, meaning ""there is no crime where there is no law"").

When applied to legislation, it simply means that the existence of a crime depends on there being a previous legal provision declaring the action to be an offence. This is the jurisprudence behind the provision in Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) that""...a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefor is prescribed in a written law"".The courts have consistently upheld this principle (Aoko v. Fagbemi (1961) 1 All NLR 1; Amadi v. FRN [2011] All FWLR (Pt. 561) 1588). In the absence of a statutory prohibition of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, their creation, use or dealing in them is lawful as they do not contravene any law in existence.

Legal or non-legal tender?

Apart from the question of the legality of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, another important consideration is whether they constitute legal tender. A legal tender refers to the money that is legally recognised in a defined jurisdiction as the means of exchange, i.e., acceptable for use to purchase goods or services and for settlement of debt or other obligations. Legal tenders take the forms of coins and banknotes (sometimes referred to as ""currency"").

The Supreme Court in the case of Okpara v FRN (1977) while explaining the concept of a legal tender in contradistinction to a counterfeit held as follows: ""Counterfeit, in relation to a bank note or current coin of a kind which is legal tender in Nigeria, means a bank note or current coin made or issued other than by or by the authority of the Central Bank of Nigeria and in relation to a bank note or current coin of a kind which is not legal tender in Nigeria means a bank note or current coin made or issued other than by or by the authority of the body which, under the laws of the country in which the bank note or current coin is legal tender, is authorised to make or issue such bank note or current coin."" Per BELLO, J.S.C. (P. 7, paras. A-C)

Generally, the characteristics of a legal tender include:

a) regulation by a national government or regional formation;

b) only a statutory authority is permitted by law to create legal tender, such as the national banks or mints;

c) the primary medium of exchange and people who trade within the jurisdiction are bound to accept it for the settlement of transactions; and

d) a unique name which identifies with a particular nation or region.

In Nigeria, the body empowered by law to issue legal tender is the CBN. Furthermore, the law also prescribes the unit of currency and its subdivision which is the Naira - further divisible into one hundred Kobo (CBN Act No. 7 of 2007, sections 2 and 15; Decimal Currency Act Cap. D2 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) 2004, Section 1). According to Section 17 of the CBN Act: ""The Bank shall have the sole right of issuing currency notes and coins throughout Nigeria and neither the Federal Government nor any State Government or Local Government, other person or authority shall issue currency notes, bank notes or coins or any documents or tokens payable to bearer on demand being document or token which are likely to pass as legal tender.""

CBN also determines the exchange rate of the Naira to other currencies in the world, and arranges for the printing of currency notes and the minting of coins. Currency notes and coins issued by CBN, shall be legal tender in Nigeria at their face value for the payment of any amount.

These laws largely apply to Nigerian currency and where they make reference to foreign currency, they seem to envisage foreign fiat currency. In view of the foregoing, it is therefore, submitted that since cryptocurrencies are not issued by CBN they are not legal tender. Therefore, laws currently governing the CBN's legal tender (Naira) may not be applied to cryptocurrencies, unless expressly revised to such.

Nigeria's approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been cautious and evolving. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has issued several circulars and directives, aimed at limiting the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. In 2017, the CBN cautioned banks and other financial institutions against facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, citing the risks associated with their use.

In 2021, the CBN went a step further by ordering the closure of bank accounts belonging to entities or individuals involved in cryptocurrency transactions. This directive was met with criticism from the cryptocurrency community, who argued that it stifled innovation and financial inclusion in the country. Despite these regulatory actions, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria remains ambiguous, as there is no comprehensive legislation specifically addressing their use and classification.

Efforts towards regulation

In recent years, there have been some efforts by the Nigerian Government to develop a more comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria released a set of regulations for digital assets and their service providers, which included guidelines for the issuance, exchange, and custody of cryptocurrencies.

However, the implementation and enforcement of these regulations have been limited, as the SEC's authority over cryptocurrency activities has been challenged by the CBN's directives. This regulatory uncertainty has created a significant barrier to the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. Nevertheless, when SEC published the SEC Rules on Issuance, Offering and Custody of Digital Assets in May, 2022, it was generally understood that the SEC Rules will apply to cryptocurrencies as either digital assets or virtual assets.

Regulation of cryptocurrencies in other selected jurisdictions

European Union

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 22 October, 2015 in the case of Skatteverket v David Hedqvist held that transactions to exchange a traditional currency for bitcoin and vice versa constitute the supply of services for consideration. It can be argued that although the case relates only to Bitcoin, the decision will apply to other cryptocurrencies.

The court also held in the case that such transactions are exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the European Union. However, while it appears that the Directive as well as case law recognises virtual currencies as medium of exchange in the European Union, it is doubtful whether it can be considered legal tender as the Directive clearly states that ""it is not necessarily attached to a fiat currency"". As such a person cannot legally be compelled to receive it in a transaction unless he is bound by any agreement to that effect.

United States of America

Just as in Nigeria, in the US, cryptocurrencies are not considered as legal tender but their use and dealing in them are legal. Laws governing virtual currency exchanges vary by state. At the federal level, authorities differ in their categorisation of cryptocurrencies. While the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) since 2013 considers them to be mediums of exchange on the basis that tokens are ""other value that substitutes for currency"" under the Code of Federal Regulations, the Inland Revenue Services (IRS) by contrast, regards cryptocurrencies as property, and has issued tax guidance accordingly.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (USSEC), considers cryptocurrencies to be securities while the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes Bitcoin and cryptocurrency derivatives as commodities and allows them to be traded publicly. The Justice Department is collaborating with USSEC and CFTC to streamline regulatory oversight and ensure effective consumer protection.

South Africa

There is no specific law or regulation governing virtual currencies in South Africa. Virtual currencies (VC) are not legal tender in the country and ""any merchant or beneficiary may refuse VCs as a means of payment"". South African Reserve Bank (SARB) warned of various risks associated with the use of virtual currencies, including issues relating to payment systems and payment service providers, price stability, money-laundering and terrorism financing, consumer risk, transactions on decentralised ledgers without an intermediary.

Taxation of cryptocurrencies

The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) makes no provision for a specific definition of tax. Rather, it provides for the distribution of taxing powers among the federal, state and local governments. However, tax has been statutorily defines in the National Tax Policy, 2107 as any compulsory payment to government imposed by law without direct benefit or return of value or a service whether it is called tax or not.

The current state of cryptocurrency taxation

Nigeria's existing tax laws do not explicitly address the taxation of cryptocurrencies. The applicable tax statutes, such as the Personal Income Tax Act and the Companies Income Tax Act, do not provide clear guidelines on how various cryptocurrency-related activities, such as trading, mining, and payments, should be taxed. As a result, there is a lack of clarity on the appropriate tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, which has led to several challenges:

1. Classification of Cryptocurrencies: The absence of a clear legal classification of cryptocurrencies (e.g., as currency, asset, or commodity) has made it difficult to determine the appropriate tax treatment.

2. Compliance and Enforcement: Without specific guidelines, taxpayers and cryptocurrency users face uncertainty in fulfilling their tax obligations, leading to potential non-compliance.

3. Revenue Generation: The government's inability to effectively tax cryptocurrency-related activities may result in the loss of potential tax revenue.

4. Investor Uncertainty: The regulatory ambiguity surrounding cryptocurrency taxation may deter potential investors and hinder the growth of the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria.

Attempts at addressing cryptocurrency taxation

The Nigerian government has made some attempts to address the taxation of cryptocurrencies, but these efforts have been limited in scope and impact. In 2020, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), the country's tax authority, issued a public notice acknowledging the existence of cryptocurrencies and stating that they should be taxed in accordance with existing tax laws. However, the notice lacked specific guidance on the applicable tax treatment and reporting requirements.

More recently, in 2022, the FIRS announced the establishment of a dedicated Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Team to enhance the monitoring and taxation of cryptocurrency transactions in Nigeria. While this move was seen as a step in the right direction, the team's specific mandate and the implementation of effective tax compliance measures remain unclear.

Challenges and limitations

The lack of a comprehensive legal and taxation framework for cryptocurrencies in Nigeria has resulted in several challenges and limitations, including:

1. Regulatory Uncertainty: The ambiguous legal status of cryptocurrencies and the conflicting directives from different regulatory bodies have created an uncertain environment for cryptocurrency users and investors.

2. Tax Compliance and Enforcement: The absence of clear tax guidelines for cryptocurrencies has made it difficult for taxpayers to comply with their obligations, and for tax authorities to effectively enforce compliance.

3. Revenue Leakage: The government's inability to effectively tax cryptocurrency-related activities have led to the potential loss of substantial tax revenue.

4. Hindered Market Development: The regulatory and taxation uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies may deter potential investors and hinder the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria.

5. Lack of Clarity for Cryptocurrency Businesses: Cryptocurrency businesses, such as exchanges and service providers, face challenges in determining their tax obligations and structuring their operations accordingly.

Future directions: Towards a comprehensive legal and taxation framework

To address the current limitations and challenges, the Nigerian government should consider the following future directions:

1. Enacting Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Legislation: The government should enact comprehensive legislation that clearly defines the legal status of cryptocurrencies and provides a clear regulatory framework for their use and taxation.

2. Establishing Clear Tax Policies: The government should issue clear guidelines on the classification of cryptocurrencies for tax purposes and the treatment of various cryptocurrency-related activities, such as trading, mining, and payments.

3. Improving Tax Administration and Enforcement: The government should strengthen the capacity of tax authorities, such as the FIRS, to effectively monitor and enforce cryptocurrency-related tax compliance, including the development of specialised expertise and the use of technological solutions.

4. Fostering Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement: The government should actively engage with cryptocurrency industry stakeholders, including exchanges, developers, and users, to better understand the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and incorporate their feedback in the policymaking process.

5. Exploring Innovative Taxation Approaches: The government should consider innovative taxation approaches, such as the introduction of a withholding tax on cryptocurrency transactions or the implementation of a digital asset registry, to enhance tax compliance and revenue generation.

6. Promoting Regulatory Clarity and Coordination: The government should ensure coordination between regulatory bodies, such as the CBN and the SEC, to provide clear and consistent guidelines on the regulation and taxation of cryptocurrencies.

7. Adopting a Balanced Approach: The government should strive to strike a balance between regulating cryptocurrencies to mitigate risks and fostering an environment that supports innovation and the growth of the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria.

Conclusion

The legal framework for taxing cryptocurrencies in Nigeria is currently in a state of flux, presenting both challenges and opportunities for policymakers and regulators. By developing a comprehensive legal and taxation framework, establishing clear policies, and fostering collaboration with industry stakeholders, the Nigerian government can create a more conducive environment for the growth of the cryptocurrency market while ensuring the appropriate taxation of related activities. This balanced approach will be crucial in navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency taxation in Nigeria and optimising the potential benefits for the country's economic development.

However, the Nigerian tax authorities can potentially consider cryptocurrency transactions as either business income or capital gains, depending on the nature of the transaction and the taxpayer's activities.

3. Value Added Tax (VAT) Act: The Value Added Tax Act (CAP. V1 LFN, 2004) in Nigeria does not provide specific guidance on the VAT treatment of cryptocurrency transactions. The Nigerian tax authorities may consider applying VAT to certain cryptocurrency-related services, such as cryptocurrency exchange services or the sale of digital assets.

4. Regulatory Guidance: The Nigerian government, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has issued some guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies. In 2019, the FIRS released a public notice stating that gains from cryptocurrency transactions should be subject to capital gains tax. The SEC has also provided guidance on the classification and regulation of certain cryptocurrency-based assets, which may have implications for their taxation.

It is however important to note that the legal framework for the taxation of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria is still evolving, and there may be additional developments or clarifications from the Nigerian government in the future. Taxpayers and businesses involved in cryptocurrency activities in Nigeria should stay informed about any updates or changes in the relevant laws and regulations.

Legality and Legal Status of Cryptocurrencies in Nigeria

Legal or Illegal?

There is no legislation in Nigeria that expressly bans the usage of cryptocurrencies. In normative systems such as law, without an express prohibition of a conduct (whether an act or omission) by a code, such a conduct is permitted. Its application in legal philosophy is that an action is permitted if it is not prohibited. In criminal law, this is known as the principle of nullum crimen sine lege (Latin, meaning ""there is no crime where there is no law"").

When applied to legislation, it simply means that the existence of a crime depends on there being a previous legal provision declaring the action to be an offence. This is the jurisprudence behind the provision in Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) that""...a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefor is prescribed in a written law"".The courts have consistently upheld this principle (Aoko v. Fagbemi (1961) 1 All NLR 1; Amadi v. FRN [2011] All FWLR (Pt. 561) 1588). In the absence of a statutory prohibition of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, their creation, use or dealing in them is lawful as they do not contravene any law in existence.

Legal or Non-Legal Tender?

Apart from the question of the legality of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, another important consideration is whether they constitute legal tender. A legal tender refers to the money that is legally recognised in a defined jurisdiction as the means of exchange, i.e., acceptable for use to purchase goods or services and for settlement of debt or other obligations. Legal tenders take the forms of coins and banknotes (sometimes referred to as ""currency"").

The Supreme Court in the case of Okpara v FRN (1977) while explaining the concept of a legal tender in contradistinction to a counterfeit held as follows:

""Counterfeit, in relation to a bank note or current coin of a kind which is legal tender in Nigeria, means a bank note or current coin made or issued other than by or by the authority of the Central Bank of Nigeria and in relation to a bank note or current coin of a kind which is not legal tender in Nigeria means a bank note or current coin made or issued other than by or by the authority of the body which, under the laws of the country in which the bank note or current coin is legal tender, is authorised to make or issue such bank note or current coin."" Per BELLO, J.S.C. (P. 7, paras. A-C)

Generally, the characteristics of a legal tender include:

a) regulation by a national government or regional formation;

[b) only a statutory authority is permitted by law to create legal tender, such as the national banks or mints;

c) the primary medium of exchange and people who trade within the jurisdiction are bound to accept it for the settlement of transactions; and

d) a unique name which identifies with a particular nation or region.

In Nigeria, the body empowered by law to issue legal tender is the CBN. Furthermore, the law also prescribes the unit of currency and its subdivision which is the Naira - further divisible into one hundred Kobo (CBN Act No. 7 of 2007, sections 2 and 15; Decimal Currency Act Cap. D2 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) 2004, Section 1). According to Section 17 of the CBN Act:

""The Bank shall have the sole right of issuing currency notes and coins throughout Nigeria and neither the Federal Government nor any State Government or Local Government, other person or authority shall issue currency notes, bank notes or coins or any documents or tokens payable to bearer on demand being document or token which are likely to pass as legal tender"".

CBN also determines the exchange rate of the Naira to other currencies in the world, and arranges for the printing of currency notes and the minting of coins. Currency notes and coins issued by CBN, shall be legal tender in Nigeria at their face value for the payment of any amount.

These laws largely apply to Nigerian currency and where they make reference to foreign currency, they seem to envisage foreign fiat currency. In view of the foregoing, it is therefore, submitted that since cryptocurrencies are not issued by CBN they are not legal tender. Therefore, laws currently governing the CBN's legal tender (Naira) may not be applied to cryptocurrencies, unless expressly revised to such.

Nigeria's approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been cautious and evolving. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has issued several circulars and directives, aimed at limiting the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. In 2017, the CBN cautioned banks and other financial institutions against facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, citing the risks associated with their use.

In 2021, the CBN went a step further by ordering the closure of bank accounts belonging to entities or individuals involved in cryptocurrency transactions. This directive was met with criticism from the cryptocurrency community, who argued that it stifled innovation and financial inclusion in the country. Despite these regulatory actions, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria remains ambiguous, as there is no comprehensive legislation specifically addressing their use and classification.

Efforts Towards Regulation

In recent years, there have been some efforts by the Nigerian Government to develop a more comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria released a set of regulations for digital assets and their service providers, which included guidelines for the issuance, exchange, and custody of cryptocurrencies.

However, the implementation and enforcement of these regulations have been limited, as the SEC's authority over cryptocurrency activities has been challenged by the CBN's directives. This regulatory uncertainty has created a significant barrier to the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. Nevertheless, when SEC published the SEC Rules on Issuance, Offering and Custody of Digital Assets in May, 2022, it was generally understood that the SEC Rules will apply to cryptocurrencies as either digital assets or virtual assets.

Regulation of Cryptocurrencies in Other Selected Jurisdictions

European Union

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 22 October, 2015 in the case of Skatteverket v David Hedqvist held that transactions to exchange a traditional currency for bitcoin and vice versa constitute the supply of services for consideration. It can be argued that although the case relates only to Bitcoin, the decision will apply to other cryptocurrencies.

The court also held in the case that such transactions are exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the European Union. However, while it appears that the Directive as well as case law recognises virtual currencies as medium of exchange in the European Union, it is doubtful whether it can be considered legal tender as the Directive clearly states that ""it is not necessarily attached to a fiat currency"". As such a person cannot legally be compelled to receive it in a transaction unless he is bound by any agreement to that effect.

United States of America (USA)

Just as in Nigeria, in the US, cryptocurrencies are not considered as legal tender but their use and dealing in them are legal. Laws governing virtual currency exchanges vary by state. At the federal level, authorities differ in their categorisation of cryptocurrencies. While the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) since 2013 considers them to be mediums of exchange on the basis that tokens are ""other value that substitutes for currency"" under the Code of Federal Regulations, the Inland Revenue Services (IRS) by contrast, regards cryptocurrencies as property, and has issued tax guidance accordingly.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (USSEC), considers cryptocurrencies to be securities while the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) describes Bitcoin and cryptocurrency derivatives as commodities and allows them to be traded publicly. The Justice Department is collaborating with USSEC and CFTC to streamline regulatory oversight and ensure effective consumer protection.

South Africa

There is no specific law or regulation governing virtual currencies in South Africa. Virtual currencies (VC) are not legal tender in the country and ""any merchant or beneficiary may refuse VCs as a means of payment"". South African Reserve Bank (SARB) warned of various risks associated with the use of virtual currencies, including issues relating to payment systems and payment service providers, price stability, money-laundering and terrorism financing, consumer risk, transactions on decentralised ledgers without an intermediary.

Taxation of Cryptocurrencies

The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) makes no provision for a specific definition of tax. Rather, it provides for the distribution of taxing powers among the federal, state and local governments. However, tax has been statutorily defines in the National Tax Policy, 2107 as any compulsory payment to government imposed by law without direct benefit or return of value or a service whether it is called tax or not.

The Current State of Cryptocurrency Taxation

Nigeria's existing tax laws do not explicitly address the taxation of cryptocurrencies. The applicable tax statutes, such as the Personal Income Tax Act and the Companies Income Tax Act, do not provide clear guidelines on how various cryptocurrency-related activities, such as trading, mining, and payments, should be taxed. As a result, there is a lack of clarity on the appropriate tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, which has led to several challenges:

1. Classification of Cryptocurrencies: The absence of a clear legal classification of cryptocurrencies (e.g., as currency, asset, or commodity) has made it difficult to determine the appropriate tax treatment.

2. Compliance and Enforcement: Without specific guidelines, taxpayers and cryptocurrency users face uncertainty in fulfilling their tax obligations, leading to potential non-compliance.

3. Revenue Generation: The government's inability to effectively tax cryptocurrency-related activities may result in the loss of potential tax revenue.

4. Investor Uncertainty: The regulatory ambiguity surrounding cryptocurrency taxation may deter potential investors and hinder the growth of the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria.

Attempts at Addressing Cryptocurrency Taxation

The Nigerian government has made some attempts to address the taxation of cryptocurrencies, but these efforts have been limited in scope and impact. In 2020, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), the country's tax authority, issued a public notice acknowledging the existence of cryptocurrencies and stating that they should be taxed in accordance with existing tax laws. However, the notice lacked specific guidance on the applicable tax treatment and reporting requirements.

More recently, in 2022, the FIRS announced the establishment of a dedicated Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Team to enhance the monitoring and taxation of cryptocurrency transactions in Nigeria. While this move was seen as a step in the right direction, the team's specific mandate and the implementation of effective tax compliance measures remain unclear.

Challenges and Limitations

The lack of a comprehensive legal and taxation framework for cryptocurrencies in Nigeria has resulted in several challenges and limitations, including:

1. Regulatory Uncertainty: The ambiguous legal status of cryptocurrencies and the conflicting directives from different regulatory bodies have created an uncertain environment for cryptocurrency users and investors.

2. Tax Compliance and Enforcement: The absence of clear tax guidelines for cryptocurrencies has made it difficult for taxpayers to comply with their obligations, and for tax authorities to effectively enforce compliance.

3. Revenue Leakage: The government's inability to effectively tax cryptocurrency-related activities have led to the potential loss of substantial tax revenue.

4. Hindered Market Development: The regulatory and taxation uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies may deter potential investors and hinder the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria.

5. Lack of Clarity for Cryptocurrency Businesses: Cryptocurrency businesses, such as exchanges and service providers, face challenges in determining their tax obligations and structuring their operations accordingly.

Future Directions: Towards a Comprehensive Legal and Taxation Framework

To address the current limitations and challenges, the Nigerian government should consider the following future directions:

1. Enacting Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Legislation: The government should enact comprehensive legislation that clearly defines the legal status of cryptocurrencies and provides a clear regulatory framework for their use and taxation.

2. Establishing Clear Tax Policies: The government should issue clear guidelines on the classification of cryptocurrencies for tax purposes and the treatment of various cryptocurrency-related activities, such as trading, mining, and payments.

3. Improving Tax Administration and Enforcement: The government should strengthen the capacity of tax authorities, such as the FIRS, to effectively monitor and enforce cryptocurrency-related tax compliance, including the development of specialised expertise and the use of technological solutions.

4. Fostering Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement: The government should actively engage with cryptocurrency industry stakeholders, including exchanges, developers, and users, to better understand the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and incorporate their feedback in the policymaking process.

5. Exploring Innovative Taxation Approaches: The government should consider innovative taxation approaches, such as the introduction of a withholding tax on cryptocurrency transactions or the implementation of a digital asset registry, to enhance tax compliance and revenue generation.

6. Promoting Regulatory Clarity and Coordination: The government should ensure coordination between regulatory bodies, such as the CBN and the SEC, to provide clear and consistent guidelines on the regulation and taxation of cryptocurrencies.

7. Adopting a Balanced Approach: The government should strive to strike a balance between regulating cryptocurrencies to mitigate risks and fostering an environment that supports innovation and the growth of the cryptocurrency market in Nigeria.

Conclusion

The legal framework for taxing cryptocurrencies in Nigeria is currently in a state of flux, presenting both challenges and opportunities for policymakers and regulators. By developing a comprehensive legal and taxation framework, establishing clear policies, and fostering collaboration with industry stakeholders, the Nigerian government can create a more conducive environment for the growth of the cryptocurrency market while ensuring the appropriate taxation of related activities. This balanced approach will be crucial in navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency taxation in Nigeria and optimising the potential benefits for the country's economic development.",,0.3960784313725489
How to Spot the Next 100x Meme Coins? | SOL Pepe | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/c510e-how-to-spot-the-next-100x-meme-coins,2024-08-31,CryptoRank,"Meme coins offer an easy entry into a dynamic market, where virtually anyone could generate a new project. The first digital asset of this type was Dogecoin (DOGE), an asset that aimed to use crypto technology for fun. DOGE was in fact a full coin, which relied on proof-of-work just like Bitcoin. Later, meme asset used token technology, and relied on other chains like Ethereum or Solana.

The meme coin market ranges from projects with utility and elaborate reward systems, to humorous themes with a nonsensical image. The biggest attraction of meme assets was their ability to grow from nothing into a multi-billion projects, appreciating faster than the rest of the crypto market and taking the spotlight from Bitcoin maximalists.

Market timing and luck meant some early buyers easily achieved 1000X appreciation and soon those opportunities took the crypto world by a storm. Grabbing the next 100X meme coin may also require additional research as the market conditions shift and buyers become more cautious. In this guide, we will cover techniques on how to spot next 100x meme coins and exploit their unique cryptocurrency potential.

Meme coins, as their name suggests, are based on the images and visual language of Internet, spawned on forums, message boards, chat apps and social media. The market for meme-based digital assets emerged from a single image, that of Kabosu, the original Shiba Inu dog that drove the success of DOGE. The strong community of DOGE took the crypto market by a storm, even competing with major cryptocurrencies. DOGE was the first meme to reach a market cap above $1B and has remained a top cryptocurrency for years.

The first generation of derivative memes also followed the ""doge"" model, spawning Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FlokiInu (FLOKI). Soon, several other categories of memes appeared, again riding on the joke of the Shiba Inu breed.

Still using the Shiba Inu breed, a series of copies appeared, aiming to build communities around a familiar image.

Frogs/Pepes: The original Pepe is a widely known cartoon character, created by artist Mark Furie. Pepe became an Internet icon on the former Twitter social media, after becoming the go-to meme on 4Chan. Pepe-themed assets can be launched independently, but are also closely tied to PolitiFi. The meme also spawned the Original Pepe NFT collection.

Those images aimed to be cute and harmless, capitalizing on the Internet's love of cats. Cat-themed launches often focus on communities and compete with doge-themed projects.

PolitiFi: this section of memes is the most contentious, focusing on political wars and themes freshly derived from world events. The main focus of PolitiFi remains US politics and the Presidential election. PolitiFi derives its images from Internet art, often an example of Wojaks, the visual shorthand for political affiliations.

Big and small celebrities from sports, show business or dubious Internet fame have tried to capitalize on the frenzy. Unlike organic memes, celebrity projects are often viewed with suspicion, despite also outperforming in the short term.

Trends: WifHat, wrapped, baby are all modifiers of existing memes. Other similar images have no claims to greatness, except being appealing and cozy. Accessorized assets, especially ""WifHat"", tend to draw loyal communities, focusing on holding until the token breaks to a new price level.

Features like the speed, fees and the available liquidity of the chain set the pace for permissionless swapping. The availability of bots and general popularity also shape the possibilities for investors.

Almost all chains and networks can generate decentralized liquidity pairs, but the most active ecosystems only rely on a handful of leading platforms.

Since 2023, Solana has become the home to the most active decentralized trade. As a cryptocurrency, SOL has had wide adoption and become a source of value for decentralized market pairs. SOL is still among the top cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization.

Driven by bots, but also real users, Solana's decentralized market got a boost from the most influential projects, including PEPE, BOME, WIF, POPCAT, MEW and others. Those top trading pairs set the stage for similar features, while carrying meme trading into mainstream centralized exchanges. Solana's ecosystem includes the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX), where a listing allows a coin to grow and gain buyers.

The original network for tokenization, Ethereum was also the home of Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the first tokenized memes. Ethereum relies on Uniswap for new token liquidity. Sometimes, there are competing versions, as in the case of Neiro (NEIRO), launched both on Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum carries the ETH cryptocurrency, which has relatively high barriers to entry because of its high price. Gas fees are one of the features of Ethereum that can still discourage retail investors.

The Base blockchain, launched by Coinbase, is a tokenless protocol with a login-based wallet. Due to the lower fees and easier user onboarding, Base has more registered activity than Ethereum. Almost all memes have a Base version, relying either on Uniswap or Aerodrome.

Toncoin is the chain closely tied to Telegram users. Meme creation on Toncoin is a bit more deliberate. Some of the Toncoin assets are only created after building a Telegram community and setting up expectations for an airdrop. Memes on Toncoin also do not copy all the themes from Ethereum and Solana, instead they often track the interests and hype on obscure Telegram communities.

Practically all L1 and L2 chains have attracted meme communities. Dextools lists more than 80 networks, with BNBChain, Polygon and TRON among the most active. Some chains have practically no activity, so using the current dashboard is the best way to estimate whether a chain is active enough and offers sufficient liquidity. Using smaller chains poses the additional challenge of buying obscure and illiquid native coins. Not all L2 small chains lock in enough value to ensure robust decentralized features.

One of the main sources of liquidity pairs that start from nothing and grow into $1B valuations are launchpads like Pump.fun or Moonshot.

New listings start with minimal liquidity and trade erratically, while trying to generate attention, bring in more traders and boost liquidity to become top coins. After reaching sufficient liquidity, the newly listed meme coins can move on to a decentralized exchange like Raydium or Uniswap.

Moonshot does not have its own website, but is available through Dexscreener, offering intuitive access to newly listed, trending or already established coins. Moonshot is a new tool for crypto enthusiasts, listing new pairs before they move onto a cryptocurrency exchange.

The platforms offer a fair launch for brand-new assets and serve to build up both interest and liquidity. Once a predetermined level of liquidity is reached, the pair moves on to Raydium and can start more regular activity with higher volumes.

At the start of picking a new meme coin, users must connect one of the approved wallets. The platforms work even for traders with no available wallet, and will redirect them to MetaMask, Phantom or other compatible wallets.

Moonshot DexScreener will provide an intuitive preview of the newest, as well as the hottest trending meme tokens and top meme coins. Moonshot listings will have an intuitive progress bar to estimate how far they are from achieving enough liquidity to be ""finalized"" and move on to other DEX.

The progress bar and time since launch will give a clear visual on whether a popular meme coin is on the move, or it has stalled in building up liquidity.

Pump.fun takes a less formal approach to listing new meme tokens. Since a record number of projects are listing, the launchpad has a very basic interface, with no tools to filter the new tokens. Pump.fun offers a random selection of meme coins, but they can be filtered for relevance based on previous wallet activity.

Listings on Pump.fun also offer access to the profile of creators, to track for serial launches and previously successful investments. Overall, an estimated 99% of meme launches will fail to reach Raydium. Pump.fun recently added live chats to each new launch, to give a glimpse of the community and potential interest as factors for success. Some of the tokens will have market cap badges, or notify potential buyers about livestreams. A live stream will often coincide with a short-term meme coin pump.

Even with highly original memes, Pump.fun launches are often not engineered for mass appeal and fail to grab the attention of social media.

Conditions on Pump.fun may change overnight. Most traders in the crypto community focus on newly launched tokens, which survive for only a few hours in their initial trading. Even a 100X pair in that initial stage can have very low returns and negligible liquidity. The ability to mint for a low cost or for free creates an unlimited amount of new launches, where the main strategy is to ""ape"" as fast as possible with small initial investments.

Once the listed pair achieve escape liquidity, they are listed as new pairs on the respective DEX. Solana meme coins land on Raydium. To access new trading pairs, aggregators like DexScreener or Dextools will give an overview of liquidity, activity and other information on whether the pair has stabilized.

New pairs will often also fail, just minutes after being listed on a DEX. Early-stage meme coins can have the biggest upside, but it is also matched by the high failure rate of nearly 99%. To ensure new meme coins are liquid, DEX trends give a glimpse of top meme coins and have healthy trading pools.

Trending themes give a glimpse of where retail has moved in, and which memes are the most appealing.

Copying a whale or a high-profile wallet may be a suitable strategy to finding a 100X meme token.

The best way to find currently active whales is through Dextools. Among currently trending communities, the occasional whale transaction will expose wallet addresses with a longer risk-taking history.

Sometimes, whales also appear in the order books of daily losers, the coins that erased most of their value. Whale action may signal the asset is ready to recover and outperform.

Manually checking the activity of whales may be too time-consuming. Tools like Dexchecker will give a preview of ""large trades"" and their latest activities. Then, move onto the ""Wallet Screener"" tab, and explore a whale's activity history.

Some of the addresses which have shown good performance can then be tracked for buying additional meme coins. Whale watching apps can create alerts when the selected wallets are active.

One way to spot the next 100X meme coins is to look at newly launched pairs on decentralized exchanges.

Dextools offers a filter to access meme coins, including a selection based on the liquidity pair age. Setting up the filter will produce a list of assets and their earnings for a specified date. New pairs may appreciate by thousands of percent within hours.

Setting up filters will bring out the hottest pairs with a relatively small age. High liquidity may be a positive sign that the liquidity pool will be more resilient.

Filtering out the best 100X meme coins will also depend on the prevalence of buyers. Before committing to a meme coin, it is best to check back on its wallet profile and make sure there are no worrying insider holdings or wallet clusters on Bubblemaps.

Buying a newly launched coin on Ethereum or Solana may not be straightforward and may depend on gas fee conditions. Transactions on Solana or Ethereum may be more costly than usual, especially for very fast purchases within the next block.

One of the most widely used bots to snipe coins on Solana is BonkBot, a Telegram-based app. BonkBot will put speed first and buy as fast as possible by simply pasting the token address.

BonkBot has a native wallet that needs a SOL deposit to start buying. The main function of BoinkBot is to buy meme coins very quickly, by using Solana services like Jupiter DEX aggregator and the JitoSOL validator.

To achieve its goal of sniping, BonkBot does not pay attention to the required fees or price slippage. For some coins, the buying fees may surpass the potential earnings. BonkBot is considered secure, but it is crucial to be aware of risks and avoid investing money you are not prepared to lose.

Several related Telegram bots can perform even faster than BonkBot but incur unpredictable fees. Transaction speed may also lag behind professional traders with high-speed connection and running RPC nodes for faster access.

BonkBot Telegram channels also perform pre-selection to notice a trend, with the potential to buy very fast without leaving the channel. The projects may seem relatively safe to invest in, but they still hold some risk of a rug pull.

Top meme coins can still grow by 100X after reaching decentralized exchanges. Even at that stage, the relatively new trending pairs need additional research to reassure against a rug pull and a crash to zero. Most new additions to Raydium or Uniswap will indeed go to zero, as early investors realize lower profits and lock in gains.

To make sure a coin pair has locked liquidity and will not go through a rug pull, click on its name on Dextools, then check the side bar for additional data. Projects with locked liquidity will have an icon, displaying the available pools and whether any locks are in place.

Before committing to a token, also check for duplicates, copycats or scams. The Rugcheck tool on Solana will check for duplicate tickers. TokenSniffer will also monitor the blockchain for known scams or honeypots.

Community engagement will also give a glimpse of a growing project. The communities of early meme coins like PEPE, BOME, SLERF, WIF and even SHIB and FLOKI show high-level activity and engagement. Online communities also warn of possible scams and set the terms of engagement to avoid malicious links in comments or in messages.

Social media content arrives at a later stage and will point to the potential development of a token. Some assets work as ""degen"" meme coins, where buying the dips or ""aping"" is the most common strategy. Others, like PEPE and WIF, focus on long-term holding, while waiting for adoption and 100X rallies.

Once a trading pair has established liquidity, it is still necessary to see if trading would be fair. Bubblemaps can check smart contracts and visualize the presence of large wallets.

The most important element to look for on Bubblemaps is ""wallet clusters,"" which are connected wallets that trade or move meme coins between them. A wallet cluster is easy to spot when visualized. Clusters are usually the work of insiders, who use them to fake token traffic and trading.

Even coins with some investment history may develop clusters after insiders buy back at low prices or move in to create fake volumes.

Bubblemaps works by inputting the name of the chosen asset or its address and then looking over the visualization to check for connected wallets. For example, a wallet cluster will display constant transactions between wallets based on blockchain data.

Identifying and sniping an early-stage project may be risky and incur additional costs. But even more established meme coins can deliver 100X growth. Other meme coins with top volume can indicate a more promising investment while avoiding stagnation. Tools like Dexcheck will show which older pairs are trending and which ones are stagnating.

Another tool to discover investments is Dexcheck, which also built a section to explore whale holdings and the success of high-frequency trading wallets.

At this stage, the project's social media footprint gains importance. An explosive growth in followers or posting, as well as announcements, can show if a meme coin is here to stay.

Established meme coins also show a rollover of traders. Buying the dip in digital assets can lead to significant appreciation, though the 100X growth stage may not be possible.

One fast way to discover the next 100X meme coin is to ask a chatbot. The Tokenmetrics AI tool is still experimental but can aggregate suggestions on potential winners.

Meme coins rely on their X (formerly Twitter) communities, but some are also growing their influence on Telegram. A growing community of channels may indicate enough holders to avoid a rug pull, at least in the short term.

Meme coins are inherently risky, but there may be additional ways to lose SOL or ETH. Telegram sniping bots are risky, due to the usage of their groups. Scams through DM attempt to steal private keys and can also drain wallets. Some bots may also be inherently risky, or at least unpredictably expensive to use.

Always perform your own research, as there are risks involved at all stages of investing.",https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,0.4666666666666666
Blockchain in Ad Tech: Ensuring transparency,https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/staff-writers/blockchain-in-ad-tech-ensuring-transparency-and-reducing-ad-fraud/,2024-08-23,MarTech Series,"Blockchain can significantly change the digital advertising market by resolving important problems like ad fraud and transparency. The advantages of blockchain, such as increased transparency, accountability, and security, make it a viable solution even if there are still many important obstacles to overcome, such as scalability, regulatory obstacles, and adoption barriers. Blockchain technology has the potential to be a key component of creating a digital advertising ecosystem that is more reliable and effective as technology advances and industry players work together.

The complicated machinery that powers digital advertising is created by the Ad Tech industry, which is confronted with numerous obstacles that jeopardize its legitimacy and efficacy. The ecosystem's lack of openness is one of the most urgent problems.

Advertisers frequently find it difficult to understand where their money is going and how their ads are being placed since there are so many middlemen engaged in the ad delivery process, including ad exchanges, demand-side platforms (DSPs), and supply-side platforms (SSPs). Inefficiencies and a lack of confidence among customers, publishers, and marketers may result from this opaque environment.

Ad fraud, which has become a serious issue in digital advertising, is still another obstacle. Fraudulent acts cost advertisers a lot of money, including click fraud, impression fraud, and domain spoofing. These dishonest tactics skew data, wasting advertising dollars while also producing incorrect performance indicators and worse decision-making. The intricacy of the Ad Tech environment makes it challenging to identify and successfully stop these fraudulent actions.

The digital advertising ecosystem's inefficiencies are another issue the sector faces. The ecosystem's fragmented structure, which includes a multitude of platforms and tools that don't always work together flawlessly, causes inconsistent data reporting, delays in ad delivery, and a difficult user experience. Reduced return on investment (ROI), resource waste, and unhappy stakeholders can all be consequences of these inefficiencies.

Let us explore how blockchain technology might help the Ad Tech sector overcome its major problems. This essay tries to offer useful insights for advertisers, publishers, and technology providers by exploring the ways that blockchain might increase transparency, decrease ad fraud, and build a more reliable digital advertising ecosystem.

We will look at the challenges that Ad Tech is currently facing, emphasizing the problems with fraud, inefficiency, and transparency. After that, it will describe blockchain technology and how these issues can be resolved by its special qualities. To demonstrate the possible advantages of integrating blockchain technology with Ad Tech, we will conclude by providing case studies and real-world examples.

Introduction to Blockchain

Many of the issues confronting the Ad Tech sector could be resolved by blockchain technology, which was first created as the foundational technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Fundamentally, blockchain is an immutable, transparent, and secure decentralized ledger that records transactions.

Because every transaction is documented in a ""block,"" which is connected to other blocks in a ""chain,"" the term ""blockchain"" refers to this arrangement of data. A high level of security and trust is provided by this structure, which guarantees that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be changed or tampered with.

Blockchain has the power to revolutionize the Ad Tech sector by increasing efficiency, lowering fraud, and bringing transparency. Blockchain, for example, can offer a transparent and verifiable record of all ad transactions, giving advertisers precise visibility into the allocation of their funds and the distribution of their advertising. Transparency can aid in the removal of unstated costs, inconsistencies, and other problems that erode systemic confidence.

Furthermore, by allowing real-time verification of ad impressions and clicks, blockchain's decentralized structure can aid in the fight against ad fraud. Since every transaction is kept on an unchangeable, secure ledger, it is easier to identify and stop fraudulent activity. Blockchain can also expedite the delivery of ads by eliminating the need for middlemen and guaranteeing that all the parties have access to the same and accurate data.

Basics of Blockchain

Fundamentally, blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that maintains an immutable, transparent, and secure record of transactions across numerous computers. Blockchain functions on a peer-to-peer network, in contrast to traditional databases, which are often run by a central authority. This implies that data is dispersed among a network of computers, sometimes known as nodes, as opposed to being stored in a single location. Transparency is guaranteed by the fact that every node in the network has a copy of the complete blockchain and that every transaction is accessible to all parties.

The immutability of blockchain is one of its primary characteristics. A transaction is almost impossible to change or remove once it is registered on the blockchain. Blockchain refers to the arrangement of transactions into blocks that are connected chronologically to form a chain. Each block has transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the block before it. The hash function makes sure that if you were to change a block, you would have to change every block after that, which is not possible to do computationally. The blockchain's data security and integrity are guaranteed by its immutability.

The transparency of blockchain is another important feature. Every user can view and validate the transactions since the ledger is dispersed over all network nodes. Because all transactions are publicly recorded and difficult to rig, this transparency lowers the risk of fraud and errors. Blockchain is a strong tool for fostering confidence among individuals who may not know or trust each other fully because it is transparent and decentralized.

Blockchain Applications in Other Industries

Numerous industries have already effectively implemented blockchain technology to boost transparency, lower fraud, and increase trust. Blockchain, for instance, is utilized in the financial industry to enable safe and transparent transactions, especially in exchanges for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. By eliminating the need for middlemen, blockchain promises to transform the financial industry by facilitating faster and more secure cross-border payments.

Blockchain is being utilized in the supply chain sector to track the provenance of commodities, guaranteeing that they are produced ethically and that their path from point of origin to point of consumption is visible. Blockchain technology has been used by businesses like IBM and Walmart to enhance food product traceability, enabling prompt source contamination identification and lowering the likelihood of widespread foodborne diseases.

Blockchain is being used in the healthcare industry to provide safe, unchangeable patient data records. This guarantees the accuracy and integrity of medical records, enhancing patient care and facilitating improved data exchange across healthcare providers. Additionally, by tracing medications along the supply chain and guaranteeing that only authentic products are sent to consumers, blockchain can aid in the fight against counterfeit drugs.

The use of blockchain in various sectors shows how technology may increase efficiency, lower fraud, and foster trust by offering a transparent and safe means of recording and verifying transactions. Adopting blockchain in the Ad Tech sector offers a promising chance to address the current issues of transparency, ad fraud, and inefficiencies as it continues to gain ground in these areas.

Ad Tech companies can build a more reliable digital advertising ecosystem where consumers, publishers, and advertisers can all trust the integrity of ad transactions by utilizing blockchain's advantages. This lays the groundwork for blockchain's revolutionary influence on advertising technology, which we will delve into more in the parts that follow.

Transparency is one of the biggest problems facing the digital advertising economy. Due to the intricacy of the digital advertising supply chain and the numerous middlemen involved, including ad exchanges, demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), and data management platforms (DMPs), advertisers frequently find it difficult to monitor the distribution of their ad spend in an opaque environment.

Due to intermediaries taking a share of the ad budget without fully disclosing the expenses, there is a lack of transparency which results in hidden fees. As a result, marketers are unaware of the actual amount of their budget that is reaching the target audience.

Furthermore, disparities in the statistics are a serious problem. Advertisers may become confused or lose faith in a campaign as a result of disparate platforms reporting disparate metrics. These differences may be the result of different measurement standards, different approaches to gathering data, or even deliberate manipulation. Because of this, it is hard for advertisers to evaluate their campaigns' performance with precision, which makes it tough to improve tactics and show return on investment.

The problems with transparency are made worse by the hazy supply chain. An advertisement's journey from the advertiser to the consumer is frequently complicated, entailing multiple transfers and resellers. Due of this intricacy, it is challenging to track the movement of funds and impressions, raising questions about whether or not money is being squandered on phony or subpar advertisements or reaching actual viewers. It is difficult to invest in digital advertising effectively when there isn't a clear and open supply chain, which also erodes ecosystem confidence.

In the realm of digital advertising, ad fraud is a widespread and expensive problem. One of the most prevalent types of fraud is click fraud, in which dishonest individuals create fictitious ad clicks to exhaust an advertiser's budget or exaggerate publishers' profits. Bots or click farms, which may sufficiently mimic human behavior to evade even the most basic fraud detection systems, are frequently responsible for these fraudulent clicks.

Consequently, advertisers squander large amounts of their budget by paying for engagements that are essentially worthless. Ad fraud is a serious and persistent danger in the world of digital advertising, eroding the credibility and efficacy of advertising efforts. This kind of fraud can take many different forms, including the creation of phony traffic, click fraud, and impression fraud.

The exaggerated costs and decreased returns on investment (ROI) for advertising are caused by these fraudulent operations. The difficulty for advertisers to verify the validity of their ad expenditure is exacerbated by the existing advertising supply chain's lack of accountability and transparency.

Another significant issue is impression fraud. This happens when advertisements are displayed to non-human visitors or in places where real people are unlikely to view them, including on subpar websites that produce fake impressions. Because advertisers are paying for ad views that are either non-existent or have very little potential for engagement, impression fraud has a significant financial impact.

A recent study by Juniper Research estimates that in 2023, ad fraud cost the world's advertising budget by around 22%, or roughly $84 billion. By 2028, this amount is expected to rise to $172 billion. Furthermore, there is rising concern that fraudsters may use cutting-edge AI technologies to expand and improve their fraudulent operations. Many tools have been created over time to tackle ad fraud, but none of them have been totally effective in doing away with the issue. But blockchain technology has just come to light as a potentially effective remedy, providing a transparent and safe means of addressing the escalating problem of ad fraud.

Ad fraud has a catastrophic financial impact on the industry as a whole. Industry estimates place the yearly cost of ad fraud on advertisers at billions of dollars, diverting funds that could be utilized to improve campaign efficacy and provide tangible business results instead. In addition to causing monetary losses, ad fraud damages the reputation of digital advertising in general, making it more difficult for reliable parties to persuade companies of the benefits of their offerings.

● Inefficiencies in the Ecosystem

The ecosystem surrounding digital advertising is rife with inefficiencies that reduce its overall efficacy. The payment delay is one of the biggest problems. Several parties are involved in the ad tech supply chain, and each one demands money for their services. The settlement of these transactions can take weeks or even months, which makes it difficult for smaller publishers to manage their cash flow and more difficult for advertisers to arrange their finances.

Inefficiencies also exist in tracking ad performance. Advertisers find it challenging to have a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of their ads due to the intricacy of the advertising supply chain. It is difficult to conduct a comprehensive analysis of performance measures because of this complexity, which frequently leads to fragmented data across multiple platforms.

Because they must rely on inconsistent reports from many providers, advertisers miss out on opportunities to improve targeting and engagement, and campaign optimization is delayed.

Moreover, the intricate nature of the advertising supply chain causes needless strain on the ecology. The process of purchasing and selling advertisements becomes laborious when there are numerous middlemen involved, which raises transaction costs and decreases efficiency. The management of digital marketing campaigns is made more difficult by this complexity, which also raises the possibility of mistakes and inconsistencies.

Therefore, advertisers, publishers, and consumers all face serious difficulties as a result of the ad tech ecosystem's inefficiencies, pervasive ad fraud problem, and lack of transparency. These problems damage industry credibility in addition to undermining the efficacy of digital advertising. Addressing these issues is essential to building a more open, reliable, and efficient environment as the digital advertising market develops.

The Role of Blockchain In Improving Transparency

Blockchain helps in improving transparency in the following ways:

With its decentralized ledger structure, blockchain technology offers a fresh approach to transparency in the advertising technology industry. Blockchain technology offers transparent and immutable ledgers that are spread among several nodes, in contrast to traditional databases that are under the control of a single institution.

All network participants can see the records of every transaction, including ad placements, clicks, and impressions, as they are added to a block and made available to all. This openness greatly lowers the possibility of hidden costs or inaccurate data since it guarantees that every dollar spent on advertising can be tracked from the advertiser to the final viewer.

Transparency is further improved by blockchain's permanent structure. An audit trail is permanently created on the blockchain since once a transaction is logged there, it cannot be removed or changed. This feature, which ensures that the data captured is accurate and unmanipulated, is essential for preserving trust within the ecosystem. The same unaltered data is accessible to intermediaries, publishers, and advertisers, promoting a common understanding of the locations and uses of advertising spend. In a sector that is frequently beset by secrecy and mistrust, this degree of transparency is revolutionary.

Ad Tech is further strengthened by blockchain, which makes it possible to track important metrics like ad impressions, clicks, and conversions in real time. Advertisers find it challenging to obtain a precise and current picture of their campaigns due to the frequent delays in data processing and reporting associated with traditional systems.

On the other hand, blockchain enables the real-time recording of data during transactions. Advertisers can make speedier modifications and better-informed decisions because to this real-time visibility, which provides them with instant information into the effectiveness of their advertisements.

Furthermore, accuracy and accountability are just as important to blockchain real-time tracking as speed. There is less opportunity for inconsistencies or data manipulation because every action is instantly recorded on the blockchain. It is the genuine status of the campaign at any given time that stakeholders can rely on from the data they are getting. By making it simpler to identify and address anomalies as they arise, this improved visibility not only improves campaign management but also aids in the prevention of fraudulent actions like click fraud or impression fraud.

The smart contract feature of blockchain technology is a potent instrument for digital advertising automation and enforcement. Advertisers and publishers can automate transactions and guarantee that contractual requirements are fulfilled by using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with established rules. Smart contracts can be extremely important in establishing requirements for legitimate transactions when it comes to preventing ad fraud. A smart contract might, for instance, automatically detect and reject fraudulent activity and only pay for confirmed ad impressions or clicks. This degree of automation improves the integrity of the whole advertising supply chain and lowers the possibility of human error.

The utilization of smart contracts is a crucial way that blockchain technology may be applied to increase transparency. Self-executing contracts, or smart contracts, have the conditions of the contract explicitly encoded into the code. Smart contracts can be used in the Ad Tech space to automate and enforce agreements between publishers, intermediaries, and advertisers. For instance, depending on information stored on the blockchain, a smart contract might automatically pay a publisher after a predetermined quantity of confirmed ad impressions have been delivered.

Smart contracts eliminate the need for middlemen and the likelihood of conflicts by automating some processes. No third party is required to administer or validate the contract because its conditions are encoded and carried out on the blockchain. This streamlined procedure lowers the possibility of fraud or misunderstanding by guaranteeing that all parties are held responsible for adhering to the terms set forth and expediting transactions.

Furthermore, smart contracts improve payment process transparency. The automatic payment of amounts due under predetermined conditions reduces the possibility of payments being contested or delayed. The blockchain records every transaction, giving rise to an unambiguous and transparent record of who was paid, for what service, and in what amount. In complicated ad tech ecosystems, where several parties are engaged in the delivery and measurement of digital ads, this level of transparency is very helpful.

Hence, the combination of blockchain's decentralized ledger, smart contracts, and real-time data tracking provides an effective toolkit for enhancing transparency in the advertising technology industry. Blockchain has the ability to greatly reduce fraud, improve trust, and create a more effective and transparent digital advertising ecosystem by offering a clear, immutable record of all transactions, giving real-time visibility into ad performance, and automating agreements.

Due to their frequent centralization, traditional advertising systems are susceptible to manipulation and attack. By dispersing data throughout a network of nodes, blockchain's decentralized architecture mitigates this weakness and fortifies it against malicious assaults and single points of failure. Blockchain protects the advertising ecosystem from tampering and unwanted access by strengthening its security.

With more control over their data and transactions, advertisers, publishers, and consumers are less likely to engage in fraudulent activities. This decentralized strategy promotes a digital advertising environment that is more secure and resilient.

Tokenization and Providing Rewards for Moral Conduct

Tokenization is another idea that blockchain brings, in which digital tokens are used to represent value in the advertising ecosystem. These tokens can be used to reward individuals for being truthful, establishing a system of positive reinforcement that deters dishonest behavior.

For example, tokens can be used by advertisers to compensate publishers and users for driving real traffic and interaction. By encouraging all parties involved to follow moral guidelines, this incentive model helps to create a more stable and reliable advertising environment.

Overcoming Implementation Obstacles for Blockchain

Blockchain technology has a lot of potential for fighting ad fraud, but before it can be properly utilized and adopted widely, a few obstacles need to be removed. Public blockchain networks may have trouble scaling, which could limit their ability to avoid ad fraud during peak times by resulting in slower transaction processing and higher costs. Furthermore, there can be opposition to change from well-established industry participants, and integrating blockchain into current advertising systems can be difficult.

Advertiser reluctance may also stem from shifting legal frameworks and regulatory concerns over blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Privacy concerns may clash with the transparency of blockchain, particularly when handling sensitive advertising data. Advertisers may also become wary due to the extreme volatility of the coins used in blockchain systems, which makes them fearful of changes in transaction value.

A unified strategy to fraud protection is challenging to implement because of the additional layer of complexity created by the lack of standards and interoperability between various blockchain systems. Furthermore, unless more environmentally friendly alternatives are created, adoption may be hampered by worries about the energy consumption of blockchain networks, particularly those that employ proof-of-work consensus techniques.

Notwithstanding these obstacles, it is projected that by 2028, $47 billion in advertising expenditure may be recouped by utilizing fraud mitigation tools, such as blockchain. Several multinational corporations have already prevented ad fraud with the use of blockchain technology and new solutions, saving millions of dollars.

But removing these obstacles is essential if blockchain is to become widely used. A transparent and safe future for digital advertising can be achieved by cooperative efforts to solve scalability, improve integration, and inform stakeholders about the advantages and applications of blockchain.

Reducing Ad Fraud with Blockchain

To reduce Ad fraud with blockchain here is what needs to be done:

Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly reduce ad fraud by doing away with the middlemen in the digital advertising supply chain. Advertisers and publishers transact through a number of middlemen in the traditional Ad Tech ecosystem, including networks, brokers, and ad exchanges. These intermediaries facilitate communication between parties, but they also open the door to ad fraud due to their ability to raise costs, manipulate data, and engage in opaque business practices.

By facilitating direct transactions between publishers and advertisers via its decentralized ledger system, blockchain technology solves this problem. The necessity for third-party verification or mediation is lessened, if not completely removed, by recording each transaction on the blockchain.

This reduces the possibility of fraudulent actions, which frequently take place in the opaque layers of intermediaries, while also streamlining the procedure. Advertisers may be sure that their ad spend is directed towards the right publishers and not diverted by dishonest individuals who pose as trustworthy middlemen by using a blockchain-based solution.

Furthermore, all transactions are public and traceable thanks to the transparency that blockchain offers.

By confirming the legitimacy of their counterparts, advertisers and publishers can lower their vulnerability to dishonest companies that could otherwise take advantage of the intricate ad supply chain. Blockchain fosters a more direct and reliable interaction between publishers and advertisers by eliminating the need for middlemen, so greatly reducing the risk of ad fraud.

The capacity of blockchain to enable verifiable ad impressions and clicks is another essential use case for lowering ad fraud. Fraudsters frequently take advantage of holes in the system to create fraudulent impressions and clicks in the current digital advertising environment, which results in wasted ad spend and distorted campaign analytics. These fraudulent activities reduce the efficacy of digital advertising overall in addition to draining marketers' money.

This problem is solved by blockchain technology, which records each ad impression and click on an unchangeable ledger, making them verifiable and impervious to manipulation. All parties involved can audit and verify the actions taken in response to an ad when they are logged as transactions on the blockchain. In this so, fraudsters are less likely to inflate metrics with fictitious activity as every impression and click is guaranteed to be genuine.

Additionally, because blockchain is decentralized, no one entity has control over the data, which makes it more difficult for scammers to influence the system. Because of blockchain's openness, advertisers can confirm that real people are interacting with their advertising, which guarantees that their marketing efforts are reaching interested and real audiences. Advertisers are able to manage their expenditures more confidently and effectively thanks to this proven authenticity, which contributes to the restoration of trust in digital advertising.

Let us look at the following case studies. These case studies demonstrate how blockchain technology can improve the overall efficiency and transparency of the digital advertising ecosystem while also lowering ad fraud. Businesses may establish a more reliable and efficient advertising environment by putting blockchain technology into practice, which will ultimately benefit publishers and advertisers alike.

A number of businesses and initiatives have already started utilizing blockchain technology to minimize ad fraud, showcasing its practical uses. For example, the blockchain-based ad tech startup Lucidity has created a platform that lets marketers follow the path of their digital advertising in real time, from placement to impression.

Using blockchain to log every stage of the advertisement's journey, Lucidity helps marketers spot irregularities and possible fraud, guaranteeing that their advertising are being delivered as promised. Through the detection and eradication of fraudulent behavior, Lucidity's technology is said to have assisted Toyota in reducing waste in its digital marketing budget during a test run.

A blockchain-based digital advertising platform called XCHNG, which offers an open-source protocol for tracking ad transactions, is another example. XCHNG uses blockchain technology to generate an unchangeable, transparent record of every ad transaction, from placement to payment.

By enabling advertisers to confirm the authenticity of their ad placements and interactions, this transparency lowers the possibility of fraud. By automating and enforcing agreements, the platform's usage of smart contracts makes sure that payments are only given for confirmed, legal transactions.

Hence, blockchain technology can effectively mitigate ad fraud by doing away with middlemen, guaranteeing authentic ad impressions and clicks, and offering a clear, unchangeable transaction history. The digital advertising industry can advance toward a future where ad fraud is greatly reduced, and trust is restored between advertisers and their consumers as more businesses use blockchain-based solutions.

Building a Trustworthy Digital Advertising Ecosystem

Building a trustworthy digital advertising ecosystem offers the following benefits:

● Enhanced Accountability

A key factor in improving accountability throughout the digital advertising industry is blockchain technology. The capacity of blockchain to build an immutable, transparent ledger that captures every transaction in real time is one of its fundamental characteristics. This means that every ad placement, impression, click, and financial transaction in the context of Ad Tech is recorded on the blockchain, making the data available and verifiable to all stakeholders.

Because every action can be linked to its original source, this transparency encourages accountability between middlemen, publishers, and marketers. In the event that disparities emerge in billing or ad performance statistics, for instance, stakeholders can quickly consult the blockchain record to confirm the data's accuracy.

This traceability guarantees that everyone is held responsible for their conduct and discourages fraudulent activity. Blockchain makes it possible for every transaction to be recorded and immutable, which lowers the possibility of dishonest behavior and strengthens the foundation of the digital advertising ecosystem.

Furthermore, no one entity has control over the data because to blockchain's decentralized structure. This removes the possibility of middlemen manipulating data or publishing anything only they want to in order to further their own agendas. Because blockchain ensures that all transactions are carried out in a fair, transparent, and responsible manner, it consequently improves the integrity of the Ad Tech sector.

● Increased Trust Between Parties

Because of problems like ad fraud, hidden costs, and opaque data practices, trust between advertisers, publishers, and consumers is frequently eroded in the traditional digital advertising ecosystem. To allay these worries, blockchain technology introduces a system that is based on the technology itself rather than on the honesty of individual participants.

All transactions and interactions are available to all parties involved thanks to blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature, which levels the playing field and enables everyone to independently confirm the accuracy of the data. This implies that publishers and advertisers may rely on the fact that their contracts are being upheld and that the information they are getting is impartial and truthful.

Customers interpret this as proof that their interactions with advertisements are real and that their data is being managed appropriately. Blockchain's decentralized structure contributes to the ecology of digital advertising becoming more trustworthy. Publishers can trust that they are getting paid properly, advertisers can trust that their money is being used wisely, and consumers can believe that they are seeing relevant and unobtrusive commercials. Better connections between all stakeholders result from this enhanced trust, which eventually makes advertising campaigns more successful and effective.

In a time when concerns about data privacy are greater than ever, blockchain provides a way for users to take back control of their personal data. Conventional digital advertising approaches frequently entail gathering and disclosing customer data without the express consent of the user, which might violate their privacy and obscure how their data is utilized.

By offering a system where consumer data is safely held and managed by the individual, blockchain technology allays these worries. Blockchain allows for a decentralized method where users can decide what information they share and with whom, as opposed to data being centralized in the hands of a few powerful corporations. Customers now have more control over their data thanks to this user-centric strategy, which also guarantees that their privacy is protected during the advertising process.

Furthermore, smart contracts that specify the conditions of data usage can be implemented more easily thanks to blockchain technology. Customers can sign contracts with publishers or advertisers that outline the terms and conditions under which their data may be used. The blockchain then automatically enforces these smart contracts, making sure that everyone abides by the conditions that were agreed upon. In addition to boosting customer confidence, this guarantees data privacy throughout the entire advertising process.

Hence, a robust set of tools for creating a reliable digital advertising ecosystem is provided by blockchain technology. Blockchain makes digital advertising more transparent, dependable, and morally sound by improving accountability, fostering mutual trust, and protecting customer data privacy. Adopting blockchain technology can assist in addressing many of the issues that have beset the Ad Tech sector as it develops further, creating a more reliable and efficient system for all parties.

● Scalability Issues

Scalability is one of the main issues with blockchain technology. Comparing blockchain networks to traditional databases, especially Ethereum-based ones, reveals that the former frequently suffers from lower transaction throughput and slower processing times. The efficiency of blockchain-based solutions can be greatly impacted by this constraint in the Ad Tech sector, where thousands of transactions must be handled per second.

Ad placement and data verification delays could impede real-time bidding (RTB) procedures and lower the overall efficacy of advertising campaigns due to the transaction speed barrier. For blockchain to be completely integrated into the rapidly evolving Ad Tech industry, its scalability problems must be resolved, even though it provides security and transparency.

● Adoption Barriers

AdTech confronts several obstacles in the mainstream use of blockchain technology. A major obstacle is the opposition of well-established business entities who profit from the current setup, since blockchain poses a challenge to their authority over information and transactions. Furthermore, adopting and sustaining blockchain systems can be quite difficult for businesses due to their technical complexity, especially for those without a solid technology base.

The issue of legislation also needs to be addressed because blockchain technology is decentralized and frequently transnational, which means that it might not comply with all laws in all jurisdictions, leading to legal ambiguities. Despite blockchain's potential advantages, these factors contribute to the Ad Tech industry's delayed adoption of the technology.

● Cost Considerations

It can be costly to implement blockchain technology, especially for smaller Ad Tech ecosystem members. Blockchain solution development, integration, and maintenance come with substantial costs, including continuing operational costs, specific skills, and infrastructure requirements. Furthermore, the energy usage of blockchain networks -- particularly those that employ proof-of-work consensus mechanisms -- can raise the price.

These costs might be unaffordable for smaller publications and advertisers, which would hinder their adoption of blockchain technology and possibly lead to a gap between well-funded, huge corporations and smaller competitors in the market. This difference in cost may restrict the democratizing potential of blockchain technology and hinder its overall adoption in the Ad Tech space.

AI may be used to evaluate and improve blockchain data, offering more thorough insights into customer behavior and ad success.

In the meanwhile, blockchain technology may be able to work with Internet of Things devices to provide more focused and targeted advertising, especially in networked settings like smart cities. These developments suggest that blockchain will eventually form part of a larger ecosystem with other cutting-edge technologies, rather than existing as a stand-alone solution. This will result in an Ad Tech environment that is more effective, transparent, and intelligent

Conclusion

The Ad Tech sector can benefit greatly from blockchain technology, especially when it comes to problems with ad fraud and transparency. A transparent, verifiable record of every transaction is provided via its decentralized, immutable ledger, which lowers the possibility of fraud and boosts stakeholder trust.

By automating procedures and guaranteeing that contracts are upheld without the need for middlemen, smart contracts further improve accountability and efficiency. All things considered, blockchain has the power to completely change the digital advertising market and make it more reliable, safe, and transparent.

Ad tech sector stakeholders must aggressively investigate and fund blockchain solutions to fully grasp the promise of blockchain technology. To do this, one must overcome opposition, deal with technological issues, and strive for scalable solutions that can meet the needs of the digital advertising industry.

For the sake of the entire ecosystem, cooperation between technology suppliers, publishers, marketers, and regulators is necessary to develop a standardized and interoperable blockchain architecture. The Ad Tech sector can create a digital advertising ecosystem that is more reliable, transparent, and efficient by integrating blockchain.

The intrinsic transparency and traceability of blockchain technology are at the core of its potential influence on ad fraud. Blockchain functions as a distributed and decentralized ledger, recording every interaction and transaction across a network of computers, in contrast to traditional advertising systems. Everybody involved in the advertising supply chain can confirm the legitimacy of every click and ad impression because of this transparent ledger.

Advertisers in a blockchain-based advertising system can track the path of every ad impression and make sure it reaches the target audience without being manipulated by middlemen. This gives advertisers previously unattainable insight into their ad expenditure.

Blockchain technology has the potential to completely transform the ad tech sector, even if it is still in its early stages of development. As the technology advances and gets over its present drawbacks, it may establish itself as a pillar of digital advertising, guaranteeing an honest, open, and fraud-free environment. Blockchain technology may play a major role in Ad Tech's future in upholding integrity and trust, resulting in a more dependable and successful platform for consumers, publishers, and advertisers.",https://martechseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blockchain-in-Ad-Tech-2.jpg,0.04313725490196085

How to Buy USD Coin (USDC) * Benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-usdc,2024-09-05,Benzinga,"Looking to grow your crypto portfolio by adding USDC? You can buy USD Coin on Coinbase.

USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin backed by reserves of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, ensuring its value corresponds to 1 U.S. dollar. This collateralization is intended to ensure that for every USDC in circulation, there is a corresponding U.S. dollar or equivalent value held in reserve, providing a level of safety and transparency for users. Historically, access to USDC has been limited on major crypto exchanges, but its growing acceptance has improved liquidity and ease of transactions, making it increasingly accessible to users looking to engage more seamlessly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Learn how to buy USD Coin (USDC) now.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy USDC safely and easily.

To purchase USD Coin, you must first open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that supports USDC trading. Visit the platform's website or download the mobile app. Search for the ""Sign Up"" or ""Register"" button and click it. You will need to enter your email address and create a password. After setting up your account, verify your identity. This process usually requires submitting personal information and documents, including a government-issued ID and proof of address, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Know Your Consumer (KYC) regulations.

You can fund your account in various ways depending on the platform. Credit card, bank transfer, or existing cryptocurrency wallets are commonly accepted. Many trading platforms allow users to link their bank accounts for direct deposits or wire transfers. Alternatively, users can use credit card or debit card, though this may result in higher fees. Follow the instructions for the payment method you choose. Enter the amount and confirm any transaction fees associated with it.

To make cryptocurrency deposits, please generate a wallet address from your exchange. Copy this address and transfer your funds from your personal crypto wallet. It is essential to verify both the address and the amount prior to confirming the transaction to ensure the security of your funds.

Because USDC is almost always equal to $1, you don't have to time the market to buy your USD Coins. If you're lucky, you may be able to snag your USDC at a discount, but don't expect the price to drop below $0.99.

There are several uses for USD Coin. Visa recently announced its plans to settle transactions in USDC on Ethereum's blockchain, which is huge news for Ethereum's network becoming more practical.

Today the most common use case for USDC is to hedge against volatility in the crypto market without leaving the crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins can also interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) programs and earn interest. Since USDC uses Ethereum's network, the stablecoin can be used on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, yearn.finance and SushiSwap - something fiat cannot do.

These decentralized applications (dApps) allow investors to earn interest, take out loans and even settle insurance claims directly on the blockchain. Being able to do so with a cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar eliminates the risk associated with volatile cryptocurrencies, allowing risk-tolerant investors to stake USDC for interest rates north of 10%.

USDC was created by Centre Consortium, a joint venture between Coinbase and Circle - aimed at increasing mainstream adoption of fiat stablecoins. USDC operates by minting new coins when a user buys them with the USD from an exchange like Coinbase. Centre Consortium then puts this cash into its reserve, ensuring that $1 of USDC can be exchanged for $1 at any time.

Created in 2018, USDC's market capitalization has risen from around $200 million to more than $34 billion as of September 2024. While the price of USDC doesn't fluctuate more than a percentage point in either direction, the number of USDC has increased significantly.

USD Coin is U.S-based and completely audited by a third party. Unlike Tether (USDT), there's no question that USDC has each and every token backed by $1 of collateral in its reserves. It should be noted that this collateral does not have to be in the form of US Dollars, certain other types of debt are deemed valid by regulators. With increased skepticism about Tether's USDT backing, USDC may be a more secure alternative.

USDC is available for purchase on well-known trading platforms including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, Crypto.com and Gemini.

If you already own crypto, you can buy USDC with Ether tokens on a decentralized exchange. You'll need a compatible Ethereum wallet -- MetaMask is the best option for Uniswap because it has an easy-to-use Google Chrome extension. After sending your Ether tokens to MetaMask, you can swap them for USDC on Uniswap.org.

Now that you know how to buy USDC you need to learn how to store it safely. You should avoid storing your cryptocurrency, including USDC, on centralized exchanges due to the risk of hacking. Instead, it's safer to use dedicated cryptocurrency wallets, which provide public and private keys to secure your funds. Software wallets operate through a program, while hardware wallets are physical devices that keep your crypto offline. Here are a few of the best crypto wallets on the market.

Ledger is a trusted hardware wallet brand among many cryptocurrency investors. The company has been selling cryptocurrency wallets since 2014, and their wallets have never been hacked. The Ledger Nano S is a multicurrency wallet, so you can store all your cryptocurrencies in one place.

Coinbase has a dedicated wallet application that's great for storing your cryptocurrency. You can store Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC and several other assets on the wallet's mobile app. Coinbase Wallet is free to download, so the only cost to you will be transaction fees to send your crypto to your wallet on the blockchain.

Trading and converting your USDC is much easier than onboarding actual U.S dollars into the cryptocurrency market. Since USDC operates on Ethereum, you can swap between USDC and any Ethereum-based token on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Sushiswap. If you use a DEX, beware of high gas fees -- due to high demand for network space.

You also can use USDC on exchanges to easily convert to other cryptocurrencies without needing to access funds from your bank account. This is a better option for most retail investors, as there are much lower fees, however, USDT is a much more common in crypto/stablecoin trading pairs.

To get an idea of where the cryptocurrency market is headed, watch the price movements of major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

For most cryptocurrency traders, it makes sense to use USDC instead of USD. It's much easier to transfer to decentralized finance protocols, as it's tokenized on the same blockchain as Ethereum.

There are plenty of opportunities to earn interest with USDC that don't exist in traditional markets, as blockchain innovations cut out the banks that capitalize on your assets. So yes, USDC is better than USD in almost every way.

Investing in USD Coin (USDC) can be worth it for those seeking to engage in the cryptocurrency ecosystem while maintaining a stable value linked to the US dollar. As a stablecoin, USDC aims to provide the benefits of cryptocurrency transactions -- such as fast transfers and lower fees -- without the high volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes it attractive for individuals looking to protect their capital amidst market fluctuations. However, potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider the risks associated with digital currencies, including regulatory changes and technological challenges, before making a decision.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/17130614/9d67b728b6c8f457717154b3a35f9ddc702eae7e76c4684ee39302c4d7fd0bb8.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.3411764705882352
Billionaires Are Buying These 2 Cryptocurrencies Hand Over Fist,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaires-are-buying-these-2-cryptocurrencies-hand-over-fist,2024-09-01,NASDAQ Stock Market,"With cryptocurrency emerging as a stand-alone asset class, a growing number of billionaires are now hunting for potential investment opportunities. Some of them are buying cryptocurrencies for their enormous upside potential, while others are buying them for their ability to diversify a portfolio or hedge their overall market position.

Based on public statements and official 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it's possible to put together a snapshot look at what top billionaires are buying. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are at the top of their shopping lists.

1. Bitcoin

Hedge fund billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones are two high-profile names making the case for why Bitcoin should become a part of a diversified portfolio. As Druckenmiller has pointed out, Bitcoin has many of the same properties as gold, making it interesting as a potential long-term store of value. And Paul Tudor Jones has made the case that Bitcoin can be one way to hedge against geopolitical and macroeconomic risk.

Billionaire hedge fund managers have emerged as some of the biggest buyers of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Based on biweekly market data from CoinShares, it's possible to see at a glance which hedge funds are the biggest buyers.

Some of them -- such as Jane Street and Susquehanna International Group -- may be familiar names to regular readers of The Wall Street Journal. Others, such as Boston-based Bracebridge Capital -- which is run by the wealthiest female hedge fund manager in the U.S. -- may be less familiar. But what they all have in common is that they're loading up on Bitcoin.

And don't forget about billionaire Larry Fink of BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), which manages over $10 trillion in assets. Back in June 2023, BlackRock was the first to file a spot Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC. That ETF -- the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) -- is now the most popular spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink is also a regular guest on CNBC, explaining why average investors should be investing in Bitcoin.

Much of the billionaire demand for Bitcoin is being driven by its upside potential. The growing consensus is that Bitcoin now has a path to $150,000 by the end of 2025. And from there, the sky's the limit. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has suggested that Bitcoin could be worth as much as $3.8 million per coin by 2030.

2. Ethereum

While Bitcoin has garnered the most attention from billionaires, don't sleep on Ethereum. Arguably, Ethereum gives you much more diversification than Bitcoin since it's much more involved in every facet of the blockchain world. Ethereum is a smart contract blockchain network. It's a building block for everything from games and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to metaverse worlds.

But what billionaires like best about Ethereum is its potential to disrupt the traditional world of Wall Street. That's due to the enormous strides being made in decentralized finance (DeFi), which can be thought of as the blockchain version of traditional finance. For example, traditional finance has centralized exchanges such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), while DeFi has decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap (CRYPTO: UNI).

Some of the best numbers about the disruptive potential of Ethereum come from Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. In this year's ""Big Ideas 2024"" report, she outlined exactly how much value is flowing from traditional finance to decentralized finance, especially smart contract blockchain networks such as Ethereum. Wood suggests that DeFi could grow at a 32% annualized rate over the next few years, making it a $5.2 trillion market opportunity by 2030.

If you're looking for a billionaire evangelist for Ethereum, look no further than Mark Cuban. Based on his experience as a tech entrepreneur and angel investor, he's well-positioned to discuss the benefits of Ethereum. Cuban has been beating the drum for Ethereum ever since 2021, when he praised its versatility and technological sophistication.

Do billionaires buy altcoins?

Based on the above, you might conclude that billionaires are only buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. That's not necessarily the case. If you parse the latest data from CoinShares, a handful of other cryptocurrencies appear to be attracting the attention of large institutional investors. These include Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC), XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA).

However, the amount of money that is flowing into these altcoins seems trivial in comparison. For example, over $8 billion has flowed into Bitcoin since the start of the year, and nearly $1 billion into Ethereum. In comparison, $34 million has flowed into Litecoin, $31 million into Solana, $22 million into XRP, and $12 million into Cardano.

This strategy of loading up on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while making relatively tiny crypto investments elsewhere, is probably one that makes sense for the average investor. You'll get the best of both worlds: enormous upside potential combined with some additional diversification for your portfolio.

Merkle Tree Efficiency in Blockchain: Essentials Explained | Adoption | CryptoRank.io,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/7e9f5-merkle-tree-efficiency-in-blockchain-explained,2024-09-02,CryptoRank,"Blockchain technology has flipped the finance world on its head, yet amid the crypto buzz, a critical component often slips under the radar: the Merkle Tree. While flashy terms like mining algorithms and consensus mechanisms often steal the spotlight, Merkle Trees quietly serve as the unsung heroes of blockchain. They ensure data integrity and security across decentralized networks.

The integration of Merkle Tree efficiency in blockchain technology, particularly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has definitely cemented their status as a fundamental component of modern cryptography. Beyond the technical jargon and complex algorithms lies a simple truth -- Merkle Trees are indispensable for maintaining the trustless nature of blockchain.

Merkle Trees are a fundamental component of blockchain technology, enabling efficient and secure data verification. As a rule of thumb, they ensure data integrity by organizing transactions into a tree structure, where the Merkle Root serves as a unique fingerprint, detecting any tampering with the underlying data.

In this article, we'll walk through the inner workings of Merkle Trees and their specific applications in blockchain technology.

At its essence, a Merkle Tree is a data structure that arranges information in a hierarchical, tree-like format. This setup allows for efficient and secure verification of data within extensive datasets. Named after its creator, Ralph Merkle, this data structure has become a key element in various cryptographic systems, including blockchain technologies.

A Merkle Tree consists of multiple nodes, with each leaf node representing a hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node representing a hash of its child nodes.

At the very top, a node called the Merkle Root, encapsulates all the data within the tree, providing a unique identifier for the dataset. This structure is inverted compared to typical trees, with the root at the top and leaves at the bottom.

Well, think of it this way. You don't need the whole fruit basket just to taste one apple. Similarly, Merkle Trees lets you verify the integrity of a piece of data without needing the entire database. Isn't that smart?

The real power of a Merkle Tree lies in its ability to enable users to verify data integrity with minimal information.

Rather than needing access to the entire dataset, one can confirm that a specific piece of data belongs to the set by examining only a small portion of the tree -- essentially a ""proof"" that traces a path from the leaf node to the root. This efficiency is particularly valuable in decentralized systems, like blockchains, where information is spread across multiple nodes.

An incredibly major challenge in decentralized networks, such as blockchain, is efficiently managing and verifying data across multiple nodes. In centralized systems, data stored in a single location is relatively easy to verify and maintain. However, in decentralized networks where data is replicated across numerous nodes. Which means it ensures data integrity becomes significantly more complex.

You know, here's a neat trick, Merkle Trees offers a smart and beautiful solution to this issue. By organizing transactions into a tree structure, blockchains use Merkle Roots to verify the integrity of large datasets swiftly and efficiently.

This approach not only cuts down on the data that needs to be stored and processed but also boosts network security by making it extremely difficult to alter past transactions without detection.

For example, in Bitcoin, each block contains a Merkle Root summarizing all transactions within that block. When a new block is added to the blockchain, its Merkle Root is included in the block header, which is then used to verify the block's integrity. If even a single transaction within the block were altered, the Merkle Root would change, indicating tampering.

This verification method is not only efficient but also scales logarithmically with the number of transactions. As the number of transactions increases, the computational effort required to verify the block increases at a much slower rate. This scalability is a key reason why Merkle Trees are so effective in blockchain technology.

Now that we've established what a Merkle Tree is and its significance in blockchain technology, let's delve into its mechanics. Understanding the inner workings of a Merkle Tree involves exploring its structure, the hashing process, and how it efficiently ensures data integrity across a decentralized network, shall we?

A Merkle Tree is a binary tree, where each node has at most two children. The structure begins with the leaf nodes, the lowest level representing individual pieces of data -- typically transaction hashes in the blockchain. Moving up the tree, each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes, culminating in the topmost node, known as the Merkle Root.

By the way, here's a fun fact! Each level of the tree acts like a checkpoint so as to confirm the authenticity of the information below it.

This hierarchical structure is both efficient and resilient. Any change in a single transaction will propagate up the tree, altering the Merkle Root and signaling data tampering.

Hashing is fundamental in constructing Merkle Trees. A hash function takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hexadecimal number. This process is deterministic, meaning the same input always produces the same output, but even the smallest change in input produces a vastly different hash.

Let me explain you in a nutshell. So basically what happens is that in blockchain systems like Bitcoin, the SHA-256 hash function is used. This function takes each transaction and hashes it to produce a 256-bit number. These hashes are then combined in pairs and hashed again to form the next level of the tree.

How to Buy Dai (DAI) * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-dai,2024-09-04,Benzinga,"Our team is diligently working to keep up with trends in the crypto markets. Keep up to date on the latest news and up-and-coming coins.

Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, making them a risky investment choice. However, stablecoins like Dai offer a more stable alternative due to their backing by underlying assets, which helps mitigate price fluctuations. Dai stands out in the stablecoin landscape as it is uniquely backed by cryptocurrency rather than fiat currency. This enables it to maintain a peg to the US dollar while providing users the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). Discover how to buy DAI with our easy-to-follow guide!

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to acquire this popular stablecoin safely and securely.

The simplest way to purchase DAI is by opening an account with a cryptocurrency exchange that supports DAI token. Popular options include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and Crypto.com. Dai is also available on a range of crypto brokers' platforms, which means you'll get to choose between multiple crypto brokers when you open your account.

To create an account, simply visit the website or app and look for the ""Sign Up"" or ""Create Account option. Provide personal information like your name and email, and prepare to verify your identity with a government-issued ID.

Before you can buy or sell cryptocurrency, you'll need to add a funding method to your account. Most platforms allow you to buy cryptocurrency using wire transfer from your bank account. Nowadays, more and more platforms are now allowing credit card or debit card purchases. Be sure that your correct funding method is linked and cleared before proceeding.

After you've set up and funded your trading account, it's time to make your purchase. Most platforms offer you access to a multitude of order types, ranging from quick-executing market orders to strictly controlled limit orders. Select the type of order that you want to place and take a look at the current price of DAI. In most cases, the price will be almost exactly equal to $1 USD. Set a price and number of DAI that you'd like to purchase and submit your order through your trading platform.

Depending on current market conditions, it can take a few minutes to one hour to finish filling your order. Once successful, you'll see your tokens in your exchange wallet.

Dai is a stablecoin that runs on the Ethereum network. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that provides investors with a much-needed safeguard against volatility by maintaining a consistent price by tying itself to an underlying asset. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rise and fall as market demands change, stablecoins attempt to stay at a single price regardless of market conditions. In most cases, this value is $1 USD. This is why every crypto investor should learn how to buy DAI. Many crypto traders close their positions by selling their volatile cryptos for the stable DAI token or another stablecoin.

Most stablecoins are backed by fiat currency like the USD in bank accounts. Dai is different because it's backed by fiat currency pegged to cryptocurrency collateral staked on the Maker Dai Stablecoin System. This provides investors with a more transparent stablecoin, as collateral assets held on the Ethereum network can be viewed publicly. Dai works closely with Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.

Dai was developed by the team behind the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol instead of a single person or small group of individuals. MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs itself entirely based on smart contract executions. MakerDAO tokens (which trade freely on many cryptocurrency exchanges) act as governance tokens, providing investors with a future vote on development matters. These tokens function in much the same way as owning shares of stocks.

Dai was introduced in 2017. Its soft peg to the USD quickly caused it to become among the most popular Ethereum-based stablecoins. Dai is currently the 18 largest cryptocurrency project when measured by total market capitalization. The coin has a market capitalization of around $5.3 billion with a daily trading volume of around $75.2 million.

Not sure where to get DAi? Consider a few of our favorite options that currently support Dai trading below.

Now that you know how to buy DAI you need to know how to store it safely. A cryptocurrency wallet provides you with a personal set of keys that you can use to store your investments off your exchange of choice. As an ERC-20 token, you can store Dai on almost any wallet that supports Ethereum. There are two types of crypto wallets: hardware wallets and software wallets. Consider our favorite ERC-compliant wallets below if you aren't sure where to begin.

A hardware wallet is a USB-like device for storing tokens offline,. It offers better protection than software wallets, though at a higher cost. The Ledger Nano X is a top cryptocurrency cold storage device that securely stores private keys for Bitcoin, ERC-20 tokens and other assets offline. It connects to the Ledger Live app for managing transactions and can install up to 100 decentralized applications (dApps) for users interested in decentralized finance.

Software wallets are applications for desktops or mobiles that store cryptocurrencies using a private online wallet. While they are less secure than hardware wallets due to internet connectivity, they offer a free means to store investments off-exchange. These wallets typically support a wider variety of tokens since they are often open-source.

MetaMask is a free software wallet available as a browser extension and mobile app. It securely stores Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. It offers a key vault and private keys for quick token transfers and allows users to connect with numerous decentralized apps without compromising personal information.

Dai is intended as a store of volatility for investors in the cryptocurrency market. Holding Dai in the long-term won't result in much of a return for investors, as the price is tied to a 1:1 ratio with USD through the Maker Dai Stablecoin System.

You can profit from an investment in Dai by strategically converting the stablecoin into an altcoin. Wait for that coin to rise in value and then converting back to Dai. As Dai maintains a consistent value, you can buy back into the project of your choice when prices fall again without losing money. This allows you to accumulate more tokens and see a return on your investment.

The cryptocurrency market can be very volatile. Though stablecoins like Dai are unlikely to see frequent changes in value, non-backed assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins can show high volatility. Understanding how the market is moving day-to-day can help you enhance your crypto trading and make the most out of your investments.

Learn more about the market at a glance with our chart below.

If you're a new cryptocurrency investor, it can be confusing to understand the differences between altcoins and stablecoins. Stablecoins like Dai allow investors to access a stable resource when investing. This can be a crucial element for day trading and scalping in such a volatile market. If you're considering becoming a short-term cryptocurrency investor, learn how to use stablecoins effectively before you enter the market. This will help you avoid fees that come with converting your coins to fiat currency each time you want to exit a trade position.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/28112901/dai.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.2627450980392156

¿Bitcoin o Ethereum? ¿Cuál es la mejor opción para invertir?,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/economia/bitcoin-o-ethereum-cual-es-la-mejor-opcion-para-invertir-nid20082024/,2024-08-20,La Nacion,"A la hora de definir nuestras inversiones surgen dudas la criptomoneda que genera más rentabilidad, pero hay ciertas diferencias que hay que tener en cuenta y que pueden inclinar la balanza

En el mundo de las inversiones, las criptomonedas han pasado de ser una curiosidad a convertirse en una de las opciones más discutidas y, a veces, controvertidas. Dentro de este ecosistema en constante evolución, dos nombres se destacan por encima del resto: Bitcoin y Ethereum. Ambas han capturado la atención de inversores, medios y reguladores, pero cuando llega el momento de invertir, surge una pregunta inevitable: ¿Cuál de estas dos criptomonedas es la mejor opción? ¿Bitcoin, la pionera que inició todo o Ethereum, la plataforma que promete revolucionar la tecnología con sus contratos inteligentes? ¿Son realmente competidores directos, o es posible que estemos ante dos activos que cumplen funciones tan distintas que la elección entre uno u otro no sea tan sencilla como parece? En esta nota, vamos a adentrarnos en el análisis de estas dos criptomonedas, explorando sus características fundamentales, su evolución en diferentes momentos del mercado, y lo que cada una tiene para ofrecer a los inversores. A medida que avancemos, iremos desentrañando si, al final del camino, la mejor opción es elegir entre Bitcoin o Ethereum, o si quizás la respuesta es más compleja de lo que parece a primera vista.

Bitcoin: Creación, Propósito y Evolución

Bitcoin, nacido en el año 2009 de la mano del misterioso Satoshi Nakamoto, fue concebido como un sistema financiero descentralizado, diseñado para ofrecer una alternativa financiera fuera del control de gobiernos y bancos. Desde entonces, su crecimiento ha sido espectacular, pasando de ser una curiosidad digital a convertirse en un pilar fundamental de la industria cripto. Con un límite de emisión máximo de 21 millones de bitcoins, su escasez es uno de los factores que más atrae a los inversores. Esta restricción deflacionaria, combinada con su seguridad basada en blockchain y su descentralización total, ha consolidado a Bitcoin como la principal reserva de valor dentro del ecosistema cripto. Hoy en día, su capitalización de mercado supera el trillón de dólares, representando más del 55% del valor de mercado total de todos los criptoactivos. Gracias a su rendimiento impresionante en un tiempo relativamente corto (en 15 años pasó de un valor de 0 a los 60 mil dólares por unidad que cotiza al momento de escribir esta nota) Bitcoin se ha ganado el título de ""Oro digital"". Es el refugio elegido por muchos en tiempos de incertidumbre económica, no solo por su potencial de apreciación, sino también por su capacidad para mantener valor en el largo plazo. Además, en la próxima elección presidencial de EE.UU., Bitcoin se encuentra en el centro de un debate político, con Donald Trump mostrándose más favorable hacia las criptomonedas, mientras que Kamala Harris adopta una postura más cautelosa. Este contexto podría influir decisivamente en su futuro y en la percepción global de Bitcoin como un activo crucial tanto en tecnología como en política.

Ethereum: Creación, Propósito y Evolución

Ethereum, lanzado en 2015 por el visionario Vitalik Buterin, nació con el objetivo de expandir las capacidades del blockchain más allá de las transacciones financieras. Concebido como una plataforma descentralizada para contratos inteligentes, Ethereum buscaba ofrecer un entorno donde los desarrolladores pudieran construir aplicaciones descentralizadas (dApps) con mayor flexibilidad y funcionalidad que las permitidas por Bitcoin.

A diferencia de Bitcoin, que se centra principalmente en ser una reserva de valor y medio de intercambio, Ethereum se distingue por su capacidad de ejecutar contratos inteligentes automáticamente cuando se cumplen ciertas condiciones. Esta característica ha permitido el surgimiento de innovaciones como DeFi (finanzas descentralizadas) y NFTs (tokens no fungibles), transformando el ecosistema cripto y ampliando significativamente el potencial de uso de la tecnología blockchain. Con una oferta de Ether (ETH) sin límite máximo definido, la economía de Ethereum se basa en la utilidad y la demanda de su red, lo que impulsa el valor de su criptomoneda. El mecanismo de consenso, que ha evolucionado desde un modelo de prueba de trabajo (PoW) a uno de prueba de participación (PoS) con Ethereum 2.0, busca mejorar la escalabilidad, seguridad y sostenibilidad de la plataforma. Ethereum ha visto un crecimiento notable desde su creación. Su capitalización de mercado ha superado los 300 billones de dólares, convirtiéndolo en el segundo criptoactivo más valioso después de Bitcoin. Esta notable apreciación refleja no solo el éxito de la plataforma en atraer desarrolladores y proyectos, sino también su influencia en el ecosistema cripto global. En el panorama político, Ethereum está ganando atención con la reciente aprobación de su ETF spot, validando aún más su papel en el mercado tradicional. Este reconocimiento de Wall Street, respaldado por figuras influyentes como Larry Fink, CEO de BlackRock, subraya la creciente legitimación de Ethereum como un activo clave tanto en el mundo de la tecnología como en las finanzas tradicionales. Hoy en día, Ethereum no solo representa un avance en la tecnología blockchain, sino que también se posiciona como un componente crucial en la evolución de la economía digital global.

Comparativa de Mercado: El Par ETH/BTC

Cuando intentamos proyectar el rendimiento futuro de Ethereum (ETH) y Bitcoin (BTC), una forma interesante de hacerlo es comparando ambos activos en lugar de analizar su valor en dólares de manera individual. Este análisis se centra en el par ETH/BTC, que nos indica cuántos Ethereum equivalen a cada Bitcoin en el mercado. Si ambos criptoactivos tuvieran el mismo valor, el ratio ETH/BTC sería de 1. Sin embargo, en el momento en que escribimos esta nota, BTC se cotiza a 59.300 dólares y ETH a 2.643 dólares, lo que da un ratio ETH/BTC de 0,04. Esto significa que aproximadamente 1 ETH equivale a 4 centavos de Bitcoin. Si miramos la historia de este par, podemos observar que el mejor momento para ETH en comparación con BTC fue en enero de 2018, cuando el ratio alcanzó los 12 centavos, es decir, ETH estaba valorado tres veces más en relación con BTC que en la actualidad. Después de esa cima, el criptomercado sufrió una caída significativa en 2018, y ETH se desplomó aún más que BTC, tocando un mínimo de 1,6 centavos en agosto de 2019. Desde entonces, ETH comenzó a recuperarse y logró llegar a 8,5 centavos en agosto de 2022, tras el final de la pandemia de coronavirus. Sin embargo, actualmente ha vuelto a caer a los 4 centavos. El gráfico que representa la evolución del par ETH/BTC revela una tendencia bajista de ETH respecto a BTC. Esta tendencia solo se rompería si el ratio volviera a los 7 centavos, lo que implicaría que ETH tendría que subir más que BTC o bajar menos en los próximos meses. Un escenario que podría cambiar esta dinámica es el comienzo de la llamada ""alt season"" (temporada de altcoins), un período en el que los tokens distintos de Bitcoin suelen experimentar un aumento más significativo en sus precios. Si llegamos a ese punto, podríamos ver una mejora en el par ETH/BTC. El análisis del par ETH/BTC puede ser un indicador clave para entender cómo pueden evolucionar Ethereum y Bitcoin no solo en función del dólar, sino en términos de su relación comparativa.

Conclusión final: ¿Bitcoin o Ethereum?

No se trata de una competencia directa entre Bitcoin y Ethereum, sino más bien de una cuestión de complementariedad. La opción más inteligente pasa por pensar en Bitcoin como el oro digital: un activo sólido y seguro, ideal para conservar valor y resguardarse en tiempos de incertidumbre económica. Por otra parte, Ethereum es como el petróleo digital: impulsa una vasta cantidad de aplicaciones y servicios que alimentan la economía digital y el desarrollo de nuevas tecnologías. Por lo tanto, la estrategia ideal no es elegir una sobre el otra, sino diversificar y mantener un portafolio que incluya ambos activos. Cada uno tiene su propio conjunto de ventajas y fortalezas que, combinadas, pueden ofrecer una estrategia de inversión más robusta y equilibrada. Esta combinación puede ser clave para una inversión exitosa en el dinámico mundo de las criptomonedas. Es importante subrayar que cada inversor debe considerar su propio perfil de riesgo y tolerancia a la volatilidad al momento de decidir cómo distribuir sus inversiones. La clave está en ajustar la asignación según las necesidades individuales y el horizonte de inversión, manteniendo siempre una visión a largo plazo y una adecuada diversificación. ¡La seguimos la semana que viene con más contenido de finanzas personales e inversiones!",https://resizer.glanacion.com/resizer/v2/bitcoin-o-6YVR4U4TFZD3LH7DE3TOFNBDLE.jpg?auth=888a92a305742f1f581b7353b48b94b692570efcb880a44188e4e90ae89cfcec&width=768&quality=70&smart=false,
Why Ethereum Casinos Should Be Your New Gaming Choice,https://coindoo.com/why-ethereum-casinos-should-be-your-new-gaming-choice/,2024-08-15,Coindoo,"As the second-largest and most established cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has made significant strides towards mainstream adoption. The introduction of ETFs further solidified Ethereum's position as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market and accelerated its adoption across various sectors, including online gambling.

An Ethereum casino is unlike a traditional casino. Ethereum casinos use blockchain technology and benefit from decentralization to transform the gaming experience for players. Why should you consider switching to an Ethereum casino?

Ethereum's blockchain technology provides significant benefits in terms of transaction speed and cost. Compared to Bitcoin's transaction speed of 7 transactions per second, Ethereum's transaction speed is approximately 15 to 30 transactions per second (TPS). This fast transaction processing allows you to deposit and withdraw funds almost instantaneously. These faster processing times are essential in high-speed settings like online casinos, where players prefer to keep the momentum going.

Ethereum's transaction fees, also known as gas fees, are usually cheaper than Bitcoin's, especially during times of low network congestion. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to have more volatile transaction fees that spike during periods of high demand. Ethereum's transaction fees, however, are far more consistent compared to other cryptocurrencies, which helps players retain most of their winnings without excessive charges. This affordability is especially appealing for crypto users.

Ethereum smart contract features contribute to a more engaging and enjoyable gambling experience. The smart contracts automate various processes without human intervention, including handling deposits, withdrawals, and payouts, which is quicker and more efficient. This means that your winnings are automatically distributed as soon as the game ends.

Smart contracts operate on the Ethereum blockchain, recording all transactions and contract executions. Players can verify that the outcomes are fair and that the rules are being followed. This transparency and immutability builds trust between the Ethereum casino and you, the player.

Since smart contracts run on the decentralized Ethereum network, the game execution does not require a central authority. The code is deployed on the blockchain, and once it is live, it operates according to the rules encoded within it, without any intervention from a casino operator.

Centralized systems can be vulnerable to failures, hacks, or dishonest practices. When a centralized casino is breached, there's a risk of tampering with players' funds and game results. On the other hand, decentralized execution eliminates the vulnerability of a single point of failure. The smart contract is spread out across nodes within the Ethereum network, ensuring that if one node fails or faces an attack, the contract remains secure and functional on other nodes.

Another advantage of Ethereum's smart contracts in casino gambling is their provably fair gaming algorithms. These smart contracts are specifically designed to verify randomness in game outcomes and execute game rules accurately. Essentially, smart contracts encode the logic of the game and payout rules within them, ensuring precise execution without any deviations. Additionally, these smart contracts include algorithms to validate the randomness of input, ensuring that results are truly random.

The Ethereum ecosystem offers access to a wide range of dApps that significantly enhance the online gambling experience. These dApps provide cutting-edge features and functionalities not available in centralized casinos, making Ethereum casinos an appealing option, for players looking for a more advanced and immersive gaming environment.

Ethereum dApps leverage the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain. Player funds are stored in decentralized wallets rather than with a centralized casino, reducing counterparty risk. The decentralized setup also makes it more difficult for bad actors to manipulate outcomes.

The decentralized nature of Ethereum allows for global participation in gambling without the restrictions often imposed by traditional payment systems. Players from various countries can engage in games without worrying about currency conversion fees or local regulations, making Ethereum casinos an attractive option for a diverse player base.

Crypto casinos tend to require less personal information from players compared to traditional online casinos, which often have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. This allows players to deposit and withdraw funds with a greater degree of anonymity, appealing to those who value privacy in their gambling activities.

Many Ethereum casinos offer unique gaming experiences, such as provably fair games and decentralized applications (dApps). These innovations enhance the overall gaming experience and allow players to verify the fairness of game outcomes, further boosting player confidence in these platforms.

The tokenization of in-game assets is indeed a significant aspect of Ethereum casinos. This process allows casinos to create and manage digital tokens that represent in-game items, rewards, or even casino chips, providing players with true ownership and the ability to trade these assets securely on the blockchain.

Tokenization enables players to own their in-game assets outright. Unlike traditional online casinos, where players do not have actual ownership of their chips or items, Ethereum casinos allow these assets to be represented as tokens on the blockchain. This means players can buy, sell, or trade their tokens freely, enhancing their engagement and investment in the gaming experience.

Casinos can issue their own tokens as rewards for players, which can be used for various purposes within the gaming ecosystem. These tokens can have real-world value and can be traded on exchanges, incentivizing players to participate more actively and fostering loyalty to the platform.

Tokenization can facilitate cross-game interactions, allowing players to use their assets across different games and platforms. This interoperability can create a richer gaming experience, where players can leverage their investments in various gaming environments.

Ethereum's ecosystem is highly diverse, offering numerous benefits that make it worth switching to an Ethereum casino. Its innovative applications, smart contract capabilities, and mainstream adoption make it a compelling choice for players looking for a secure and efficient gambling experience.",,0.1294117647058823
Unlocking the Swiss Crypto Haven: A Deep Dive into the Country's Booming Market and Regulatory Landscape - News Directory 3,https://www.newsdirectory3.com/unlocking-the-swiss-crypto-haven-a-deep-dive-into-the-countrys-booming-market-and-regulatory-landscape/,2024-09-10,News Directory 3,"Zurich⁢ Cantonal Bank Launches Trading and Custody Services for Bitcoin and Ethereum

Zurich Cantonal Bank⁣ (ZKB), one of the largest cantonal banks in Switzerland, has officially launched trading and custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the announcement, ZKB ⁢customers can conduct cryptocurrency transactions around⁣ the clock through the bank's electronic banking and mobile banking platforms. ZKB also provides secure cryptocurrency custody⁢ services to ensure that customers do not need to keep⁣ their private⁣ keys themselves.

ZKB's service is not only for ⁣individual customers, but also ⁣provides support for other⁣ third-party banks. As ⁢a B2B (business-to-business) solution, it enables other Swiss⁤ banks to provide trading and secure storage services for⁣ Bitcoin⁣ and Ethereum⁤ to their⁢ customers. The first cooperative bank to use the service is Thurgau Cantonal Bank, which trades through Crypto Finance AG, a financial technology company, a subsidiary of the German Stock Exchange Group.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is one of the first ⁤financial regulators in the world⁢ to develop a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. FINMA ⁢ensures the legality and transparency of cryptocurrency businesses through its Swiss⁢ Blockchain Act and Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA). The agency provides clear guidelines for companies engaged in cryptocurrency⁤ business and requires these companies to obtain the corresponding licenses, such as a Fintech License or a DLT Trading Platform License.

FINMA's regulatory framework emphasizes the⁤ following core principles:

The Swiss canton of Zug is known as the ""Crypto ⁣Valley"" for its early acceptance⁣ and⁢ promotion of cryptocurrency. ⁣The region has attracted ⁣a large number of blockchain and cryptocurrency companies and⁤ is the core of global blockchain technology innovation. Blockchain companies such as ⁢the Ethereum Foundation and Cardano have offices in the region.

The rapid development of Crypto Valley is due to the following factors:

Switzerland is not only a leader in cryptocurrency regulation, but also has global influence in blockchain technology application and innovation. Switzerland's SIX Digital Exchange is one of the⁢ world's first digital asset trading platforms, allowing users to trade digital⁢ assets⁢ such as digital bonds. ZKB has also actively participated in innovation in this field, participating in the world's first digital ⁤bond issuance project ⁤and⁤ cooperating with the Swiss National ⁣Bank to pilot the⁣ central bank digital⁤ currency (CBDC).

Switzerland's cryptocurrency ecosystem is no longer limited ⁤to its own country, and its innovative model and regulatory experience are being referenced and adopted by other countries around the world. For example, relevant⁢ regulatory agencies in the European Union⁣ and the United States are drawing on Switzerland's experience⁣ to develop⁢ their⁤ own cryptocurrency legal frameworks. ⁢Switzerland has become an⁤ important promoter and standard setter for global cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

In the future, Switzerland's further development ⁤in the field of cryptocurrency may involve more asset⁣ tokenization and innovative applications of cross-border payments. As a frontier country in⁤ financial innovation, ⁤Switzerland will continue to play its leading⁣ role in exploring the integration of cryptocurrency and traditional financial systems.

Switzerland ⁢is a leader ⁤in⁤ the regulation, innovation, and global influence ⁣of⁢ cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. This provides a solid foundation for traditional banks, including ZKB, ⁢to enter⁣ the cryptocurrency market, ⁤and also sets an example for the healthy development of the global⁢ cryptocurrency industry.",https://image.coinlive.com/cryptotwits-static/d76a46da6e434eae185bca78c0c70c5d.jpg,0.3254901960784313
4 Bear and 3 Bull Scenarios for Ethereum (ETH) Price in September,https://cryptopotato.com/4-bear-and-3-bull-scenarios-for-ethereum-eth-price-in-september//,2024-09-07,CryptoPotato,"ETH was slightly up YTD and 46% for the trailing 12-months Thursday. But it has some big prospects ahead when alt season kicks in on this Bitcoin super cycle.

That is if Ethereum can weather three big price hurdles ahead of it in September,

The Dencun upgrade's introduction of low-cost blobs for Layer-2 blockchains to quickly scale the network to peers has unleashed a torrent of activity on Ethereum's decentralized smart contract network.

Since then, gas fees in ETH on the base layer of Ethereum have declined significantly. Although that has reduced validators' revenues, there has been a blossoming of activity on low-fee L2s.

Ethereum L2 monthly active users doubled after Dencun took effect in March. Meanwhile, fees to use Base, Mantra, Starknet, Blast, and OP Mainnet have declined dramatically.

But Ethereum has struggled this year to reflect its improvements and future prospects in a consolidated movement of the market. When it slipped to $2,400 this week, its price was back to where it was in February. By comparison, Bitcoin has been doing a little better this year.

So will Ether's price continue to thrash and flail, or does it have an advantage over competitors like BNB, Solana, XRP, Tron, and Cardano in the near to medium term?

Here are four advantages Ethereum has going forward:

21co, the owner of Bitcoin ETF issuer 21 Shares, just recently introduced another Wrapped Bitcoin asset on Ethereum.

This is a reminder: Your Bitcoin is a final settlement in a brutally scarce currency on the most secure Web3 layer blockchain -- and Ethereum represents so many things you can do with it without just handing it over to the establishment it's disrupting.

While Bitcoin is in a long-term holding phase because of its network effects and the growth prospects of each Satoshi's value due to its ultimately addressable global market, when the dam breaks and the pent-up demand spills, Ethereum is certainly one place where holders will be spending it.

From finance, to insurance, to contracts, to CRMs, to supply chain management, to gaming, and online database solutions, the leading smart contract networks like Ethereum have a very big future ahead.

Wall Street has so far laid only finicky hands on the Ethereum ETFs, with outflows creating resistance for Ether's price. But the overall institutional stance toward the asset is still second only to Bitcoin, even as corporate project managers and institutional hedge funds flirt with Ethereum's competitors like Solana and Cardano.

However, Ethereum and ERC20 Layer-2 protocol Polygon (MATIC) power most of the institutional products currently available on Web3. A recent X post from Adriano Feria, a popular ETH booster on social media, outlined the march of corporate projects using Ethereum.

""Hate to break it to the #Ethereum doubters, but $ETH is well on its way to securing solid institutional adoption, led by industry giants like Coinbase, Circle, BlackRock, and more recently, Sony,"" Feria wrote.

With Sony's announcement on August 22 that it's launching its own Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, Soneium, there could be some more market alpha in ETH's future.

ETH just had its worst month in two years, falling by 22% in August. Therefore, mean reversion theory dictates that its price will tend to move back toward its average trend over time, giving it support for a rally. Put in shoppers' terms, Ether was on sale in August.

ETH may be undervalued based on expert predictions from some of the most active funds, publications, and banks in the Web3 space, in a recent study by CoinGecko:

The Federal Reserve chair announcing in August a pivot to lower interest rates is likely to galvanize crypto markets. As dollar supplies increase, there's extra liquidity to pump financial markets like stocks and cryptocurrency.

There's also a baked-in ethos among crypto investors to hedge dollar inflation using cryptocurrencies, especially those that strictly limit new supplies.

Ethereum is especially well-suited as one of these alternative sound money currencies. After the Merge transitioned it from a mined to staked cryptocurrency in Sept. 2022, it also introduced a burn feature that removes a small amount of Ether when transactions are made.

That helps limit supplies and so that ETH tokens hold their purchasing power parity against other currencies like Bitcoin and the US dollar.

September is historically a slumpy month for financial markets. In stocks, it is the only calendar month to return an average negative ROI over the past 98 years. It has typically been choppy and slow for crypto assets as well, with seasonally high volatility and lower prices.

That means it can make a great entry point for crypto investors to buy assets at good value. It's also not usually the time of year to sell to maximize earnings or minimize losses.

Markets are also fretting over the outcome of the U.S. election in November. A Harris win could lead to rising prices, higher taxes, and more expensive regulations.

A Trump win could lead to another multi-trillion dollar trade war with half the rest of the world, which was expensive for Wall Street the last time around.

Ethereum's valuation is closely related to the spot price of BTC. Over the course of the four-year cycle around Bitcoin's supply halvings, there tends to be a mild bear market around this time after the event, leading up to multi-month rally to new record highs. That's going to have an impact on altcoin prices.",https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ethereum_Bull_Bear.jpg,0.2156862745098038
10 underrated cryptocurrencies you should know about in 2024: Insights from Mudrex Expert,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/10-underrated-cryptocurrencies-you-should-know-about-in-2024-insights-from-mudrex-expert/articleshow/113124621.cms,2024-09-06,The Economic Times,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are looking beyond the popular names like Bitcoin and Ethereum, seeking opportunities in lesser-known, underrated tokens that offer promising growth potential. Anush Jafer, a research expert from Mudrex, recently shared insights on this very topic during an ETMarkets live stream, shedding light on 10 underrated cryptocurrencies that could play a significant role in 2024.

In this session, Jafer explained the importance of diversification across market caps -- small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap cryptocurrencies -- and how this strategy helps build a resilient crypto portfolio. Here's a detailed look at the cryptocurrencies discussed and why they're worth watching.

Cryptocurrencies, like stocks, are categorised by their market capitalization, which reflects the size, stability, and growth potential of a project. Large-cap coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are well-established with strong liquidity, making them safer bets. Mid-cap cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, offer higher growth potential but come with moderate risk. Finally, small-cap cryptocurrencies, though volatile, provide significant upside for investors willing to take on additional risk.

Jafer highlighted the importance of diversifying a portfolio across these categories to manage risk and maximise potential returns. A balanced portfolio ensures exposure to a wide range of market segments, allowing investors to weather market fluctuations and capitalise on emerging trends within different niches like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming.

Here are the ten underrated cryptocurrencies identified by Anush Jafer that have the potential to make waves in 2024:

Ether is an innovative blockchain project specialising in decentralised cloud computing, particularly for gaming and virtual reality. By reducing latency and offering more cost-effective solutions, Ether aims to revolutionise the gaming industry.

"Buy bitcoin, ether and other crypto ETFs with less risk. Just follow these tips.",https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240911313/buy-bitcoin-ether-and-other-crypto-etfs-with-less-risk-just-follow-these-tips,2024-09-11,Morningstar,"Cryptocurrency ETFs are safer than owning crypto itself - but you're still in unknown territory

With the rise of cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds, many investors believe they've found a safer way to dip into the volatile world of bitcoin (BTCUSD), ether (ETHUSD) and other digital assets. While crypto ETFs offer a layer of protection direct crypto investment lacks, they're not without their own set of risks. Here's what you need to know to protect your crypto holdings:

1. Keep it real: Investing in crypto through ETFs is generally safer than holding cryptocurrencies directly. You're not dealing with digital wallets, private keys or the risk of crypto-exchange hacks. Yet this apparent safety net can lull investors into a false sense of security. Remember, the underlying assets are still highly volatile, and this volatility will be reflected in the ETF's value.

During the bitcoin price crash of 2022, for example, when the popular crypto's value plunged more than 60% from its all-time high, ETFs tracking bitcoin's price saw similar declines. While ETFs protect you from some crypto-specific risks, they don't insulate you from market volatility.

2. Understand what you're buying: When you buy a crypto ETF, you're not getting a standard financial product. You're investing in a fund that holds or tracks cryptocurrencies or blockchain-related companies. You need to know how crypto trading operates. For instance, if your ETF is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, a sudden regulatory crackdown on bitcoin mining could significantly impact your investment. Similarly, a major security flaw discovered in Ethereum could tank the value of ETFs with large ether holdings.

Some crypto ETFs include stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology - ranging from crypto exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN) and mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), to Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants investing in blockchain. Publicly traded companies come with their own risks and potential rewards.

Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto ETFs face unique challenges when it comes to asset custody. The companies holding the actual cryptocurrencies for the ETF (known as custodians) are a potential point of failure. If a custodian's security is breached, it could lead to significant losses for the ETF and, by extension, your investment.

3. Custody matters: Always research the custodial arrangements of any crypto ETF you're considering. Look for ETFs that use reputable custodians with a track record of strong security measures, including cold storage for assets and comprehensive insurance policies.

Here's what to ask about an ETF's custodian:

What security measures are in place? Have they ever experienced a security breach? If so, how was it handled?Are multisignature wallets in use? What portion of assets is held in cold storage versus hot wallets? What insurance policies do they have, and what exactly do these policies cover?

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still in development, and this uncertainty extends to crypto ETFs. A sudden regulatory change could force an ETF to quickly sell off assets, potentially at unfavorable prices. In extreme cases, regulatory shifts could even lead to the delisting of an ETF.

Stay informed about the regulatory environment in the countries where your ETF operates. Be prepared for the possibility that rules could change rapidly, affecting your investment.

Consider these scenarios:

A country bans cryptocurrency mining, affecting the profitability of mining companies in your ETF's portfolio.New tax regulations are introduced, impacting the ETF's returns or reporting requirements.Stricter know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules are implemented, potentially limiting the ETF's ability to trade certain assets.

4. Liquidity trap: Crypto ETFs can face liquidity issues, especially during times of market stress. If a large number of investors try to sell their ETF shares simultaneously, the fund might struggle to sell its crypto holdings fast enough to meet redemption demands. This could lead to the ETF trading at a significant discount to its net asset value. Before investing, check the liquidity of the ETF and its underlying assets. Larger, more established funds tend to have better liquidity.

Here are some factors that can affect an ETF's liquidity:

Trading volume: Higher daily trading volumes generally indicate better liquidity.Assets under management: Larger funds usually have better liquidity.Spread: A narrow bid-ask spread often indicates good liquidity.Creation/redemption process: Understand how the ETF creates and redeems shares, as this can impact liquidity.

5. New scams: While crypto ETFs protect you from many traditional cryptocurrency scams, they've given rise to a new breed of fraudulent activities. Watch out for:

Fake ETFs: Scammers create fraudulent ETFs that mimic legitimate ones. Always verify an ETF's legitimacy through official channels like the SEC's EDGAR database.

Sophisticated phishing: Instead of trying to steal your crypto wallet keys, scammers might impersonate your broker or the ETF company to gain access to your investment account. These attacks can be highly targeted. For example, a scammer might use information from your social-media profiles to craft a convincing impersonation of your financial adviser, then try to persuade you to transfer funds or share account details.

Deepfake dangers: Some scammers use deepfake technology to impersonate financial advisers or ETF executives. Always verify the identity of anyone asking you to make investment decisions, especially if they're pressuring you to act quickly.

Pump-and-dump schemes: While not exclusive to ETFs, pump-and-dump schemes can target smaller or newer crypto ETFs. Scammers might spread false information to inflate the price of an ETF or its underlying assets, then sell their holdings once the price has risen.

Front-running: This is when someone with advance knowledge of a large pending transaction uses that information for their own profit. In the context of ETFs, an unethical insider might use knowledge of the ETF's rebalancing schedule to trade the underlying assets beforehand.

Tracking error

Crypto ETFs, especially those using futures contracts rather than holding cryptocurrencies directly, can suffer from tracking error. This means the ETF's performance may not perfectly mirror the performance of the underlying assets it's meant to track.

Factors contributing to tracking error include:

Management fees Transaction costsDifferences between spot and futures prices (for futures-based ETFs)Rebalancing frequency

Protecting your portfolio

How can you safeguard your investments? Here are some key steps:

1. Do your homework: Thoroughly research any ETF before investing. Understand its holdings, management team, and track record. Look into the fund's prospectus, which will detail its investment strategy, risks, and fees. Pay attention to the expense ratio - while crypto ETFs tend to have higher fees than traditional ETFs, excessive fees can eat into your returns.

2. Secure your brokerage account: Use strong, unique passwords and hardware-based two-factor authentication. Be wary of using public Wi-Fi for accessing your investment accounts.

3. Stay informed: Keep up with news about the cryptocurrencies your ETF holds and any regulatory developments. Follow reputable financial news sources and consider setting up alerts for news related to your investments.

4. Diversify: Don't concentrate your portfolio. Crypto ETFs should be part of a diversified portfolio, not your maininvestment strategy. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when deciding what portion of your portfolio to allocate to crypto ETFs.

5. Be skeptical: If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be especially wary of unsolicited investment advice or pressure to act quickly. Take the time to verify information independently before making any investment decisions.

6. Understand the tax implications: Crypto ETF investments can have complex tax implications. Consult with a tax professional to understand how your investments might affect your tax situation.

7. Use reputable brokers: Only invest through well-known, regulated brokers. Check their credentials and read reviews from other users.

8. Monitor investments regularly: Keep an eye on your ETF's performance and any changes in its underlying assets or management strategy. However, avoid the temptation to make knee-jerk reactions to short-term market movements.

By understanding these unique challenges and taking proactive steps, you can navigate the crypto ETF landscape safely and confidently. Remember, in the world of investing, knowledge isn't just power - it's protection.

Cryptocurrency Development: Building and Managing Digital Currencies,https://techbullion.com/cryptocurrency-development-building-and-managing-digital-currencies/,2024-09-10,TechBullion,"Cryptocurrency has transformed the financial landscape, offering a decentralized and secure way to transfer value globally. The journey from a mere concept to a fully operational digital currency involves several complex processes. Developing and managing cryptocurrencies require a deep understanding of blockchain technology, cryptographic algorithms, and the financial market.

Understanding the Basics of Cryptocurrency What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network called blockchain. This decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation.

How Does Blockchain Work?

At the core of every cryptocurrency is blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, and once a block is completed, it is added to the chain in a linear, chronological order. This system makes blockchain inherently secure, as altering one block would require altering every subsequent block, which is nearly impossible due to the computing power required.

Key Steps in Cryptocurrency Development Defining the Purpose and Use Case

The first step in developing a cryptocurrency is to define its purpose. Are you creating a currency to facilitate transactions, build a platform, or solve a specific problem? Understanding the primary use case will guide the development process. For example, Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized alternative to fiat money, while Ethereum was built to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

Choosing the Consensus Mechanism

A consensus mechanism is a method used by blockchain networks to agree on the validity of transactions. The choice of consensus mechanism significantly impacts the performance, security, and scalability of the cryptocurrency. The most common mechanisms include:

Proof of Work (PoW):

Used by Bitcoin, PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

Proof of Stake (PoS):

PoS, used by cryptocurrencies like Ethereum 2.0, allows validators to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to ""stake"" as collateral.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):

In DPoS, stakeholders vote for a small number of delegates who validate transactions and maintain the blockchain.

Each mechanism has its strengths and trade-offs, so the choice should align with the goals of your cryptocurrency.

Designing the Blockchain Architecture

Designing the blockchain architecture involves deciding whether to use an existing blockchain platform or create a new one from scratch. Using an existing platform like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana can save time and resources, but building a custom blockchain allows for more flexibility and control.

Factors to consider include: Scalability:

How many transactions per second can the blockchain handle?

Security:

What measures are in place to protect against hacks and fraud?

Flexibility:

Can the blockchain support future updates and improvements?

Developing Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automate processes and reduce the need for intermediaries, making transactions faster and more cost-effective. Developing robust and secure smart contracts is crucial, as any vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors.

Creating the Cryptocurrency Token

Tokens are the digital assets used within a blockchain network. If you are developing on an existing blockchain, you can create tokens using standards like ERC-20 for Ethereum or BEP-20 for Binance Smart Chain. Token creation involves specifying parameters such as total supply, distribution method, and whether the tokens can be minted or burned.

Managing a Cryptocurrency Ensuring Security and Compliance

Security is paramount in cryptocurrency management. Regular audits, implementing strong encryption protocols, and staying updated on security threats are essential steps to protect the network. Additionally, navigating the regulatory landscape is crucial. Cryptocurrencies must comply with legal requirements in various jurisdictions, including anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations.

Building and Maintaining a Community

A strong, engaged community is vital for the success of any cryptocurrency. Developers should focus on building a loyal user base through transparent communication, regular updates, and incentivizing participation. Community management platforms like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter are popular among crypto projects for engaging with their audience.

Listing on Exchanges

To increase liquidity and accessibility, cryptocurrencies need to be listed on exchanges. There are two types of exchanges:

Centralized Exchanges (CEX):

Platforms like Binance and Coinbase offer high liquidity and user-friendly interfaces but require users to trust the exchange with their funds.

Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):

DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap allow users to trade directly from their wallets, promoting decentralization and reducing the risk of hacks associated with centralized platforms.

Listing on multiple exchanges can significantly enhance a cryptocurrency's market presence and appeal.

Ongoing Development and Upgrades

The cryptocurrency landscape is dynamic, with continuous advancements in technology and market trends. To stay competitive, ongoing development and regular upgrades are essential. Additionally, This may include improving the blockchain's scalability, enhancing security features, or integrating new functionalities like interoperability with other blockchains.

Challenges in Cryptocurrency Development and Management Technical Challenges

Developing a secure and scalable blockchain is a complex task that requires extensive knowledge of cryptography, coding, and blockchain protocols. Even minor coding errors can lead to vulnerabilities, making thorough testing and audits indispensable.

Regulatory Challenges

Cryptocurrencies operate in a largely unregulated space, but this is changing as governments worldwide develop new laws and regulations. Keeping up with these changes and ensuring compliance can be challenging, especially for global projects operating across multiple jurisdictions.

Market Volatility

Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their price volatility. Managing a digital currency also means dealing with rapid market fluctuations, which can impact user adoption and the overall stability of the project.

Competition

The cryptocurrency market is crowded, with thousands of projects vying for attention. Differentiating your project and demonstrating its value proposition is critical to attract users and investors.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrency development is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning, technical expertise, and strategic management. From defining the purpose and designing the blockchain architecture to ensuring security and compliance, each step plays a critical role in the success of a digital currency. While the challenges are significant, the potential rewards make it a compelling endeavor for innovators and entrepreneurs alike. Thus, As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and adaptable will be key to thriving in this fast-paced industry.

What is Coinbase Wallet?,https://www.theblock.co/learn/311565/what-is-coinbase-wallet,2024-08-24,The Block,"Coinbase Wallet is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to manage and store their digital assets. The wallet was developed and created by popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, from where it draws its name.

Unlike Coinbase's wallet for its main exchange, Coinbase Wallet gives users complete control over their private keys. This means that users, rather than Coinbase, are in full control over their digital assets and are responsible for the security of their cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

Coinbase Wallet acts as a gateway to decentralized applications and web3, enabling users to explore, trade and interact with various blockchain-based platforms.

History of Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet was originally called Toshi when it was launched in 2017 and was initially focused on the Ethereum ecosystem. Toshi was launched as a mobile app and featured a browser that enabled users to easily find and interact with various dapps. Toshi was rebranded to Coinbase Wallet in August 2018.

In February 2019, Coinbase Wallet extended support to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

In February 2020, Coinbase Wallet added a username feature that allowed users to send and receive funds from their address names rather than having to find long crypto addresses.

Coinbase Wallet rolled out in-app purchases of cryptocurrency with fiat in October 2020. Before this, users had to set up an account with a centralized exchange, purchase crypto and send it to the wallet for storage.

In July 2021, support was extended to the Polygon Network. Later that year, Coinbase Wallet launched its own standalone browser extension. This extended the use of Coinbase Wallet beyond just mobile applications and allowed users to access their wallets across different platforms.

In 2022, Coinbase Wallet expanded its support to Solana, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain, allowing users to store and trade thousands of tokens and NFTs in the app.

Coinbase Wallet launched in-app messaging and Ethereum staking solutions in collaboration with Kiln in 2023.

In July 2024, Coinbase Wallet announced its new smart wallet. Smart wallets use smart contracts to simplify and abstract away certain aspects and complexities associated with setting up and managing a traditional non-custodial wallet. Coinbase claims it simplifies onboarding and removes the need for speed phrases, saying that users can use their Face ID, Google Chrome profile, Yubi Key or fingerprints to access and use their funds.

Furthermore, developers can choose to sponsor transaction gas fees for their customers, removing the need for users to top up their accounts before transacting.

Features and functions

Coinbase Wallet offers various features that cater to both novice and experienced users. Users can securely store, manage, send and receive cryptocurrencies and NFTs across many layer 1 networks.

Users can carry out token swaps within the app by connecting to various decentralized exchanges, with adjustable network fees depending on their transaction speed preferences. The wallet also supports fiat purchases of crypto, allowing users to make purchases directly in the app with credit or debit cards, depending on their location.

Coinbase Wallet can integrate and interact with countless dapps across the cryptocurrency ecosystem and on a wide variety of networks. Users can access and explore DeFi projects and other decentralized applications through the built-in dapp browser.

Coinbase Wallet's security features include two-factor authentication, biometric security options and the ability to connect with hardware wallets like Ledger for added protection. Furthermore, community and customer support is available for those who run into issues.

What's needed for a Coinbase Wallet account?

To access Coinbase Wallet, prospective users either need a mobile device for the app or a browser for the Coinbase Wallet extension.

Setting up the wallet involves creating a secure password and backing up a 12-word seed phrase, which is crucial for regaining access to the wallet if a user loses their device, or to transfer it to another platform.

Unlike Coinbase.com, users do not need to create an account with Coinbase to use the wallet, and don't have to provide personal identification details. Coinbase Wallet accounts are free to create.

Are there any risks to using Coinbase Wallet?

While Coinbase Wallet offers many security features, using Coinbase Wallet nevertheless involves certain risks that users should be aware of. As a self-custody wallet, the responsibility for storing the private keys lies entirely with the user; losing these keys or the recovery phrase could result in permanent loss of access to the wallet. Coinbase Wallet does not offer institutional support for recovery, meaning users are fully responsible for their wallet's security and access.

While Coinbase Wallet includes security measures like transaction previews and a dapp blocklist, users must remain vigilant, as interacting with dapps still carries the risk of encountering malicious platforms that could compromise assets.

Additionally, since private keys are stored on the user's device, the security of the wallet is directly tied to the security of the device itself; a compromised device could put the wallet at risk.","https://www.tbstat.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,q=75/wp/uploads/2023/10/20231006_Coinbase_News3.jpg",0.2627450980392156
RWA Insight: Web3 + Art = Meme? ULTILAND Explores Meme-like RWA in Digital Art Assets,https://www.crypto-reporter.com/newsfeed/rwa-insight-web3-art-meme-ultiland-explores-meme-like-rwa-in-digital-art-assets-75597/,2024-09-05,Crypto Reporter,"From the first stirrings of life beneath the waves,

the greatest art quietly paves, in universe.

When starry nights meet Van Gogh's humble gaze,

and Meme trend with RWA power ablaze.

In the Web3 era, ""Art"" within ""Artificial"" stays.

Why the Age-Old Concept of RWA Continues to Be a Timeless Narrative

Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization is a significant application of Web3 technology in the realm of tangible assets and even in the art market. Through RWA, physical artworks can be converted into digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling their trade and investment in digital markets. This method not only enhances the liquidity of artworks but also increases their financial value. Currently, the total market value of RWAs has reached $8 billion, with expectations to grow to $16 billion by 2025.

RWAs are backed or supported by real-world assets, making them relatively stable compared to the volatile nature of virtual assets. This stability is crucial for the diversified allocation of virtual assets; a balanced virtual asset portfolio requires a reasonable mix of high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk or risk-free assets. RWA will drive diversified portfolio investment or allocation in crypto investments, moving beyond simple speculation and the extreme fluctuations of cryptocurrency markets.

Investors have varying levels of risk aversion and risk tolerance, and they also have different expectations for returns. This diversity creates opportunities for interest rate swaps or arbitrage, whether in a bull or bear market, which in turn generates liquidity. Therefore, one of the keys to RWA's success lies in achieving greater liquidity.

As the public continues to discuss RWAs, they gradually recognize their value, such as global cross-market trading, reduced transaction costs, and improved transaction efficiency. RWAs also pave the way for tokenizing emerging assets like AI computing power, data, and artworks, leading to a consensus on their valuation expectations, with a more inclusive and transparent pricing model and security. However, concerns also arise regarding RWAs, including regulatory and compliance issues, insufficient liquidity, and technological and operational risks.

The Art Market is Undergoing a Digital and Innovative Transformation

With the rapid development of the blockchain market, the concept of Web3 is gradually being integrated into the art market, bringing unprecedented opportunities. Web3 technology, through decentralized, transparent, and secure trading methods, makes the digitization, tokenization, and online trading of artworks possible. This not only enhances the liquidity and market transparency of artworks but also provides new income streams for artists and collectors.

According to the ""Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report,"" the art market has shown strong performance during the post-pandemic recovery, with the total global art market value expected to reach $75 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, Web3 applications like NFTs and RWAs are rapidly gaining popularity, further driving the prosperity of the art market.

As more artists, collectors, and investors enter this field, the integration of Web3 with the art market will undoubtedly continue to lead future trends of innovation. RWAs are reshaping the art market by offering broader investment opportunities and higher market transparency. This trend not only fosters the flourishing development of the art market but also creates more commercial opportunities and financial value for artists and collectors.

The Collision of Web3 Assets and the Art Market

It is well known that Web3 has three directions: meme assets (Meme), application assets (BTC, ETH), and real-world assets (RWA). Some question whether RWA is truly a native digital token, prompting a thought: could Bitcoin be considered an RWA tokenized from energy?

With the introduction of BTC and ETH ETFs, Web3 is gradually moving away from the semi-closed loop of internal financing and external buy-ins. The influx of real-world assets into Web3 presents a significant opportunity for the upcoming cycles. RWA represents the physical business within the crypto industry and is an inevitable path for the blockchain industry.

As the global economy declines, the lipstick effect has impacted the art market post-pandemic, and NFTs have further ingrained the concept of digitizing artworks in people's minds. The traditional art market relies on conventional value experiences and trading methods, whereas AI and blockchain technology have established a new paradigm in the digital art market. This breakthrough has created new avenues for emerging art investments and consumption choices, broadening the creative and monetization paths for artists.

When considering RWAs and the art market, asset tokenization is no longer the most challenging aspect of RWA development, as the necessary infrastructure has long been established. The disconnect between continuous off-chain verification and on-chain value representation is the primary reason for slow growth and the depreciation of on-chain assets.

Most RWA products are concentrated in expensive assets, limited to easily quantifiable financial products, and involve complex KYC procedures and high knowledge barriers, making them difficult for consumers to engage with, unlike memes, which are simple to participate in. The scale and thresholds make it inaccessible to the average consumer.

When thinking about the value presentation of art and artworks in the Web3 context, we often instinctively associate it with NFTs. However, in 2024, we are no longer FOMO-driven participants in the NFT bubble and should clearly understand that:

Even NFTs cannot effectively ensure the original author's copyright and intellectual property rights, and the created works are merely ""digital versions"" without substantial financial or application value. Additionally, the related industry chain is still incomplete. Using NFTs as a carrier of the financial attributes of artworks is inappropriate, as issues of liquidity and ownership persist, with no artistic value to speak of. High-priced NFTs are often native financial products on the chain, not artworks. Meme's conveyed artistic nature and financial expression, in contrast, have a more significant impact.

Meme-like RWA Makes RWA More Than Web2.5

RWA, as a security token of real-world assets, involves more than merely tokenizing physical assets and issuing tokens. It should be approached on three levels: starting from the underlying asset, then considering the type of expected returns, and finally, the tokenization process.

Based on this, Ultiland has proposed the concept of Meme-like RWA to create more attractive and innovative financial products.

Combining Asset Stability with Memes

Asset stability is the cornerstone of RWA, and Meme-like RWA enhances the perception of this stability by integrating assets with popular cultural symbols. The universal appeal of memes helps build a loyal community that not only focuses on the current value of the asset but also holds confidence in its future stability. Through meme dissemination, the stability narrative of RWA spreads quickly, attracting more investors and holders.

Secondary Derivation of RWA Asset Value

The Meme-like RWA model provides new avenues for the secondary derivation of RWA asset value. By creatively combining RWA assets with meme culture, new financial derivatives can be developed, such as tokens or NFTs based on specific meme themes. These derivatives not only offer new revenue opportunities for investors but also increase the diversity and fun of RWA assets, thereby attracting a broader audience.

Iterative Design of Yield Farming

The Meme-like RWA model iteratively designs yield farming by combining mining models with meme culture, creating a fun and profitable investment approach. Community members can earn additional token rewards by participating in meme challenges, creating related content, or completing specific tasks. This method not only enhances the appeal of RWA assets but also increases community activity and engagement.

Derivation of Interest-bearing Assets

The Meme-like RWA model allows the underlying assets of RWA to derive interest-bearing assets. These assets, through meme forms, combine current returns with future expectations, creating new investment value. For example, a token related to a specific meme can be designed, with its value depending not only on the performance of the underlying RWA asset but also on the community's enthusiasm and engagement with meme culture.

Dual Design of Real-World Assets

In the Meme-like RWA model, real-world assets are given a dual design of current returns and future expectations. This design considers not only the immediate returns of the asset but also its potential value growth over time as community participation increases. Through the dissemination of meme culture and community co-creation, RWA assets can achieve sustained growth and expansion in value.

Through the above methodology, the Meme-like RWA model injects new vitality into traditional RWA by combining the power of meme culture and community, creating more attractive, interactive, and innovative financial products. This model not only enhances the market performance of RWAs but also drives innovation and development across the blockchain financial sector.

The RWA space is filled with opportunities but also faces many challenges. Regulation and compliance, insufficient liquidity, technological and operational risks, and market acceptance are the current main pain points. However, asset diversification, stable cash flow and returns, market expansion, and innovative development prospects make RWA a highly watched area in the crypto market. The Meme-like RWA model significantly improves the liquidity and market acceptance of RWA assets by leveraging the spread of meme culture, addressing the aforementioned pain points, and bringing new opportunities for asset diversification, stable cash flow and returns, market expansion, and innovation. As technology continues to advance and the market matures, Meme-like RWA is expected to play a more significant role in the future, driving deeper integration between blockchain and traditional financial markets.

Ultiland's Innovations and Solutions

At Ultiland, art is not just a source of creative inspiration but also a form of asset representation. Through the dissemination of meme culture, the value of artworks and real-world assets can be tested in the market, helping quality assets gain early traction and liquidity. By combining meme as a form of performance art with RWA, Ultiland brings more creative and business opportunities to both artworks and investors.

By integrating artworks, meme culture, and real-world assets (RWA), Ultiland introduces the concept of Meme-like RWA, offering a range of unique protocols and services that facilitate the trading and circulation of assets within the blockchain network.

Ultiland LaunchPad offers decentralized token issuance capabilities, allowing anyone to participate in asset issuance and investment. LaunchPad supports liquidity protection and incentive mechanisms to enhance market confidence and activity while safeguarding user interests. $BOND is the general term for tokens issued on Ultiland LaunchPad, used to tokenize various real-world assets, such as artworks, real estate, antiques, as well as meme, artistic value, and personal influence. $BOND is issued and traded through the Bonding Curve model, aiming to increase asset liquidity and market value.

Bonding Curve LaunchPad

Price Discovery: The Bonding Curve model achieves dynamic pricing through mathematical formulas, ensuring that prices change with market demand, establishing a fair market price discovery mechanism and laying a solid foundation for the post-launch development of $BOND.

Liquidity Protection: Tokens can be traded during the token launch phase, and a portion of the funds from the sale of artworks and other real-world assets flows into DEX LP, ensuring liquidity supply after token issuance and enhancing market confidence and activity.

Incentive Mechanisms: $BOND's design includes reward mechanisms that encourage investors to participate in trading mining and holders to engage in staking mining, producing $ARTX, thereby stabilizing the market and preventing extreme price volatility driven by meme-like behavior.

Decentralized Issuance: Offers a simple and customizable decentralized token issuance capability, allowing anyone to participate in asset issuance and investment, lowering the entry barrier and expanding the potential investor base.

Special Asset Entity

Transparency and Fairness: SAE provides transparent and fair asset evaluation services, ensuring the true value of all on-chain assets, preventing manipulation and information asymmetry.

Risk Reduction: The custodial segregation mechanism ensures that assets are separated from personal accounts, reducing the risk of asset misappropriation or loss, thereby increasing investor confidence.

Enhanced Credibility: Assets evaluated and held by SAE will have all related information (such as ownership, value, legal documents, etc.) converted into data on the blockchain. This data is typically stored in smart contracts, ensuring information transparency and immutability.

Legal Compliance: Through professional evaluation and custody, SAE ensures compliance with relevant laws and regulations, bridging the gap for legal asset issuance and trading.

RWA Oracle: A blockchain tool that verifies and provides real-world asset data, ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of on-chain asset information; combined with the aforementioned foundational capabilities of SAE to form the Special Asset Entity Protocol.

Through the combination of the Meme-launch model, SAE decentralized asset evaluation system, and RWA Oracle, Ultiland ensures the legality and value of assets from the foundational asset level, builds investor confidence in RWAs, and provides a clear earnings model at the expected return level, ensuring investors can receive dividends based on the cash flow generated by the asset. At the final level of tokenization, tokens are not merely digital representations of assets but active participants with practical functions. Token holders can participate in governance, earn returns, and even play a more significant role in the community, ensuring token value stability and growth.

The practice of the Meme-like RWA concept in Ultiland is to allow the market to test the value of artworks and other real-world assets, helping valuable assets gain early traction and liquidity, and eventually reach DEX and CEX with a promising price.

Ultiland offers an on-chain lending protocol for real-world assets, allowing users to pledge real-world assets evaluated by SAE to obtain digital currency loans.

RWA Insight: Web3 + Art = Meme? ULTILAND Explores Meme-like RWA in Digital Art Assets,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/09/g40727597/rwa-insight-web3-art-meme-ultiland-explores-meme-like-rwa-in-digital-art-assets,2024-09-05,Benzinga,"HONG KONG, Sept. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

From the first stirrings of life beneath the waves,

the greatest art quietly paves, in universe.

When starry nights meet Van Gogh's humble gaze,

and Meme trend with RWA power ablaze.

In the Web3 era, ""Art"" within ""Artificial"" stays.

Why the Age-Old Concept of RWA Continues to Be a Timeless Narrative

Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization is a significant application of Web3 technology in the realm of tangible assets and even in the art market. Through RWA, physical artworks can be converted into digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling their trade and investment in digital markets. This method not only enhances the liquidity of artworks but also increases their financial value. Currently, the total market value of RWAs has reached $8 billion, with expectations to grow to $16 billion by 2025.

RWAs are backed or supported by real-world assets, making them relatively stable compared to the volatile nature of virtual assets. This stability is crucial for the diversified allocation of virtual assets; a balanced virtual asset portfolio requires a reasonable mix of high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk or risk-free assets. RWA will drive diversified portfolio investment or allocation in crypto investments, moving beyond simple speculation and the extreme fluctuations of cryptocurrency markets.

Investors have varying levels of risk aversion and risk tolerance, and they also have different expectations for returns. This diversity creates opportunities for interest rate swaps or arbitrage, whether in a bull or bear market, which in turn generates liquidity. Therefore, one of the keys to RWA's success lies in achieving greater liquidity.

As the public continues to discuss RWAs, they gradually recognize their value, such as global cross-market trading, reduced transaction costs, and improved transaction efficiency. RWAs also pave the way for tokenizing emerging assets like AI computing power, data, and artworks, leading to a consensus on their valuation expectations, with a more inclusive and transparent pricing model and security. However, concerns also arise regarding RWAs, including regulatory and compliance issues, insufficient liquidity, and technological and operational risks.

The Art Market is Undergoing a Digital and Innovative Transformation

With the rapid development of the blockchain market, the concept of Web3 is gradually being integrated into the art market, bringing unprecedented opportunities. Web3 technology, through decentralized, transparent, and secure trading methods, makes the digitization, tokenization, and online trading of artworks possible. This not only enhances the liquidity and market transparency of artworks but also provides new income streams for artists and collectors.

According to the ""Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report,"" the art market has shown strong performance during the post-pandemic recovery, with the total global art market value expected to reach $75 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, Web3 applications like NFTs and RWAs are rapidly gaining popularity, further driving the prosperity of the art market.

As more artists, collectors, and investors enter this field, the integration of Web3 with the art market will undoubtedly continue to lead future trends of innovation. RWAs are reshaping the art market by offering broader investment opportunities and higher market transparency. This trend not only fosters the flourishing development of the art market but also creates more commercial opportunities and financial value for artists and collectors.

The Collision of Web3 Assets and the Art Market

It is well known that Web3 has three directions: meme assets (Meme), application assets (BTC, ETH), and real-world assets (RWA). Some question whether RWA is truly a native digital token, prompting a thought: could Bitcoin be considered an RWA tokenized from energy?

With the introduction of BTC and ETH ETFs, Web3 is gradually moving away from the semi-closed loop of internal financing and external buy-ins. The influx of real-world assets into Web3 presents a significant opportunity for the upcoming cycles. RWA represents the physical business within the crypto industry and is an inevitable path for the blockchain industry.

As the global economy declines, the lipstick effect has impacted the art market post-pandemic, and NFTs have further ingrained the concept of digitizing artworks in people's minds. The traditional art market relies on conventional value experiences and trading methods, whereas AI and blockchain technology have established a new paradigm in the digital art market. This breakthrough has created new avenues for emerging art investments and consumption choices, broadening the creative and monetization paths for artists.

When considering RWAs and the art market, asset tokenization is no longer the most challenging aspect of RWA development, as the necessary infrastructure has long been established. The disconnect between continuous off-chain verification and on-chain value representation is the primary reason for slow growth and the depreciation of on-chain assets.

Most RWA products are concentrated in expensive assets, limited to easily quantifiable financial products, and involve complex KYC procedures and high knowledge barriers, making them difficult for consumers to engage with, unlike memes, which are simple to participate in. The scale and thresholds make it inaccessible to the average consumer.

When thinking about the value presentation of art and artworks in the Web3 context, we often instinctively associate it with NFTs. However, in 2024, we are no longer FOMO-driven participants in the NFT bubble and should clearly understand that:

Even NFTs cannot effectively ensure the original author's copyright and intellectual property rights, and the created works are merely ""digital versions"" without substantial financial or application value. Additionally, the related industry chain is still incomplete. Using NFTs as a carrier of the financial attributes of artworks is inappropriate, as issues of liquidity and ownership persist, with no artistic value to speak of. High-priced NFTs are often native financial products on the chain, not artworks. Meme's conveyed artistic nature and financial expression, in contrast, have a more significant impact.

Meme-like RWA Makes RWA More Than Web2.5

RWA, as a security token of real-world assets, involves more than merely tokenizing physical assets and issuing tokens. It should be approached on three levels: starting from the underlying asset, then considering the type of expected returns, and finally, the tokenization process.

Based on this, Ultiland has proposed the concept of Meme-like RWA to create more attractive and innovative financial products.

Combining Asset Stability with Memes

Asset stability is the cornerstone of RWA, and Meme-like RWA enhances the perception of this stability by integrating assets with popular cultural symbols. The universal appeal of memes helps build a loyal community that not only focuses on the current value of the asset but also holds confidence in its future stability. Through meme dissemination, the stability narrative of RWA spreads quickly, attracting more investors and holders.

Secondary Derivation of RWA Asset Value

The Meme-like RWA model provides new avenues for the secondary derivation of RWA asset value. By creatively combining RWA assets with meme culture, new financial derivatives can be developed, such as tokens or NFTs based on specific meme themes. These derivatives not only offer new revenue opportunities for investors but also increase the diversity and fun of RWA assets, thereby attracting a broader audience.

Iterative Design of Yield Farming

The Meme-like RWA model iteratively designs yield farming by combining mining models with meme culture, creating a fun and profitable investment approach. Community members can earn additional token rewards by participating in meme challenges, creating related content, or completing specific tasks. This method not only enhances the appeal of RWA assets but also increases community activity and engagement.

Derivation of Interest-bearing Assets

The Meme-like RWA model allows the underlying assets of RWA to derive interest-bearing assets. These assets, through meme forms, combine current returns with future expectations, creating new investment value. For example, a token related to a specific meme can be designed, with its value depending not only on the performance of the underlying RWA asset but also on the community's enthusiasm and engagement with meme culture.

Dual Design of Real-World Assets

In the Meme-like RWA model, real-world assets are given a dual design of current returns and future expectations. This design considers not only the immediate returns of the asset but also its potential value growth over time as community participation increases. Through the dissemination of meme culture and community co-creation, RWA assets can achieve sustained growth and expansion in value.

Through the above methodology, the Meme-like RWA model injects new vitality into traditional RWA by combining the power of meme culture and community, creating more attractive, interactive, and innovative financial products. This model not only enhances the market performance of RWAs but also drives innovation and development across the blockchain financial sector.

The RWA space is filled with opportunities but also faces many challenges. Regulation and compliance, insufficient liquidity, technological and operational risks, and market acceptance are the current main pain points. However, asset diversification, stable cash flow and returns, market expansion, and innovative development prospects make RWA a highly watched area in the crypto market. The Meme-like RWA model significantly improves the liquidity and market acceptance of RWA assets by leveraging the spread of meme culture, addressing the aforementioned pain points, and bringing new opportunities for asset diversification, stable cash flow and returns, market expansion, and innovation. As technology continues to advance and the market matures, Meme-like RWA is expected to play a more significant role in the future, driving deeper integration between blockchain and traditional financial markets.

Ultiland's Innovations and Solutions

At Ultiland, art is not just a source of creative inspiration but also a form of asset representation. Through the dissemination of meme culture, the value of artworks and real-world assets can be tested in the market, helping quality assets gain early traction and liquidity. By combining meme as a form of performance art with RWA, Ultiland brings more creative and business opportunities to both artworks and investors.

Ultiland is an on-chain asset issuance and lending platform that starts with artworks and extends to physical and financial assets. By integrating artworks, meme culture, and real-world assets (RWA), Ultiland introduces the concept of Meme-like RWA, offering a range of unique protocols and services that facilitate the trading and circulation of assets within the blockchain network.

Ultiland LaunchPad offers decentralized token issuance capabilities, allowing anyone to participate in asset issuance and investment. LaunchPad supports liquidity protection and incentive mechanisms to enhance market confidence and activity while safeguarding user interests. $BOND is the general term for tokens issued on Ultiland LaunchPad, used to tokenize various real-world assets, such as artworks, real estate, antiques, as well as meme, artistic value, and personal influence. $BOND is issued and traded through the Bonding Curve model, aiming to increase asset liquidity and market value.

Bonding Curve LaunchPad

Price Discovery: The Bonding Curve model achieves dynamic pricing through mathematical formulas, ensuring that prices change with market demand, establishing a fair market price discovery mechanism and laying a solid foundation for the post-launch development of $BOND.

Liquidity Protection: Tokens can be traded during the token launch phase, and a portion of the funds from the sale of artworks and other real-world assets flows into DEX LP, ensuring liquidity supply after token issuance and enhancing market confidence and activity.

Incentive Mechanisms: $BOND's design includes reward mechanisms that encourage investors to participate in trading mining and holders to engage in staking mining, producing $ARTX, thereby stabilizing the market and preventing extreme price volatility driven by meme-like behavior.

Decentralized Issuance: Offers a simple and customizable decentralized token issuance capability, allowing anyone to participate in asset issuance and investment, lowering the entry barrier and expanding the potential investor base.

Special Asset Entity

Transparency and Fairness: SAE provides transparent and fair asset evaluation services, ensuring the true value of all on-chain assets, preventing manipulation and information asymmetry.

Risk Reduction: The custodial segregation mechanism ensures that assets are separated from personal accounts, reducing the risk of asset misappropriation or loss, thereby increasing investor confidence.

Enhanced Credibility: Assets evaluated and held by SAE will have all related information (such as ownership, value, legal documents, etc.) converted into data on the blockchain. This data is typically stored in smart contracts, ensuring information transparency and immutability.

Legal Compliance: Through professional evaluation and custody, SAE ensures compliance with relevant laws and regulations, bridging the gap for legal asset issuance and trading.

RWA Oracle: A blockchain tool that verifies and provides real-world asset data, ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of on-chain asset information; combined with the aforementioned foundational capabilities of SAE to form the Special Asset Entity Protocol.

Through the combination of the Meme-launch model, SAE decentralized asset evaluation system, and RWA Oracle, Ultiland ensures the legality and value of assets from the foundational asset level, builds investor confidence in RWAs, and provides a clear earnings model at the expected return level, ensuring investors can receive dividends based on the cash flow generated by the asset. At the final level of tokenization, tokens are not merely digital representations of assets but active participants with practical functions. Token holders can participate in governance, earn returns, and even play a more significant role in the community, ensuring token value stability and growth.

The practice of the Meme-like RWA concept in Ultiland is to allow the market to test the value of artworks and other real-world assets, helping valuable assets gain early traction and liquidity, and eventually reach DEX and CEX with a promising price.

Ultiland offers an on-chain lending protocol for real-world assets, allowing users to pledge real-world assets evaluated by SAE to obtain digital currency loans. The entire process utilizes smart contracts to ensure transparency, fairness, and security in lending. Borrowers can also establish an on-chain credit score, obtaining higher limits and lower interest rates on loans.

The Necessity of Ultiland in Web3

Diversified Assets and Scenarios

Ultiland not only supports the NFTization of artworks but also covers a wide range of real-world assets. It provides a complete service chain for token issuance, decentralized auctions, asset evaluation, and on-chain lending, forming a comprehensive RWA and digital asset management platform.

How to Buy MakerDAO Token (MKR) * Benzinga Crypto,https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-maker-mkr,2024-08-23,Benzinga,"Cryptocurrency projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the industry's spotlight. However, smaller altcoins also offer investment opportunities. One noteworthy option is Maker, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows users to lock up cryptocurrency to produce a backed stablecoin called ""Dai."" Dai is a unique stablecoin. Unlike others, it is backed by cryptocurrencies instead of fiat currency.

As more investors look to capitalize on the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi), the demand for Maker DAO tokens is surging. Purchasing Maker can allow you to invest in a growing network of app developers operating on the Ethereum network. Learn how to buy Maker DAO Token effortlessly with our step-by-step guide! Discover the best platforms, wallets, and tips to start your crypto journey today.

Follow these simple steps to buy MakerDAO Token (MKR).

The first step to buying Maker is to open an account with a broker that supports Maker purchases. Cryptocurrency brokers operate in a very similar manner to stockbrokers. First, you'll create an account through your broker of choice. Like opening a brokerage account, you'll usually need to provide a bit of personal information to your broker before you can access the market. Some common information you might need to provide may include you full name, ID, social security number and home address.

It's worth it to take the time to compare a few brokers before you decide where you want to open an account. Some of the best cryptocurrency trading platforms are Gemini, eToro and Coinbase. Gemini is a great option because it lets users earn interest on their digital assets, passively growing your crypto holdings over time.

Once you have verified your account, you need to deposit funds to it. Funding options include wire and bank transfer, ACH transfer, Apple Pay and Google Pay, and Debit Card Purchases.

After your trading account is open and funded, it's time to place your Maker purchase order. Log into your brokerage account and take a look at the current market price of the Maker token. Use the current market rate to determine how many tokens you want to purchase.

Place an order through your broker. Most brokers offer multiple order types, and the type of order you choose will play a role in the amount of money that you'll pay for each token. Let's take a look at two common order types your broker will typically provide access to.

Choose your order type and place your order through your broker's platform. If your broker is able to fill your order, you'll see your tokens in your brokerage account.

After you open your account and purchase Maker, you'll see your tokens held in your brokerage account wallet. While you can leave your tokens in this wallet, brokerage accounts are much more susceptible to hacks than private wallets. We recommend that you purchase or open a private wallet to keep your Maker safe.

There are two major types of cryptocurrency wallets:

We recommend using a cold storage, or hardware wallet, to store your tokens, as it provides you with the highest possible level of security.

MKR, or Maker, is a governance token used in the MakerDAO ecosystem, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It plays a crucial role in the operation of the Dai stablecoin, a decentralized digital currency that is pegged to the US dollar. MKR holders have the ability to participate in the governance of the Maker protocol, making decisions on key aspects such as risk parameters, collateral types and system upgrades. By staking MKR, users help maintain the stability and integrity of the Dai stablecoin system. Additionally, MKR can be used to pay stability fees for borrowing Dai. It also serves to recapitalize the system during downturns, making it an essential component in supporting the overall health of the Maker ecosystem.

If you're a U.S investor, it's a good idea to use a cryptocurrency exchange or brokerage that's based inside the United States. Often times, these exchanges will have better security, customer service and more liquidity than some competitors. Plus, you'll know that the platform is up to par with current regulations.

Choosing the right storage solution for your MakerDAO tokens is crucial in safeguarding your investment. From hardware wallets and software options to exchanges and custodial services, the choices can be staggering.

No matter which types of cryptocurrency you're investing in, you'll find a one-stop-shop when you choose the Trezor Model T to provide your cold storage. The Model T supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and hundreds of ERC-20 tokens (including Maker), providing you with a complete solution to storage for your investment.

The Trezor Model T can also be an excellent choice for investors who need to manage their coins on the road without connecting to a computer. The Model T features a unique LCD color touchscreen that makes checking your balances easier and more convenient.

If you're a Linux user, you might have a hard time finding a wallet that's fully compatible with your system. The SecuX W10's hardware is compatible with Mac, Windows and Linux desktop computers, which can provide you with easier management solutions.

The SecuX W10 combines affordability with security and support for a wide range of tokens and coins. Like the Trezor Model T, the SecuX W10 features a bring display screen, which makes tracking and viewing your wallet offline easier and safer.

At Dharma.io, you get more than a crypto wallet. You can invest in MKR by converting cash from your bank account. Connect your account, choose MKR out of the nearly 74,000 tokens that are available. You can invest across 2 networks, and you can choose from one of 55 DeFi exchanges.

By converting your cash to crypto, you can quickly invest without hiring a broker. Plus, Dharma.io stakes your coins through Compound so that you earn up to 6.98%.

You can reach the support team via ZenDesk, keep the app on all your mobile devices and invest in the crypto market without overspending on fees.

After your broker fills your order, you'll need to decide if you want to become an active Maker trader or if you want to hold onto your tokens and sell them at a later date. If you want to trade, you'll capitalize on small, short-term price movements throughout the day or week by strategically converting your Maker into a stablecoin (like Tether) when prices rise. You'll then sell them back when prices fall, keeping the difference as profit. Browse a list of our favorite trading platforms below.

If you want to become a long-term investor, we recommend storing your Maker tokens in a cold wallet. Cold wallets provide you with a private set of keys, which prevents hacks and makes theft less likely. Be sure to keep track of your cold storage wallet and your keys after you transfer them to your wallet.

Maker can add a unique layer of diversification to your cryptocurrency portfolio. It's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is largely unregulated. Never invest more money than you can afford to lose in any cryptocurrency, and don't view cryptocurrency as an alternative to traditional investments.",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/16154209/maker.png?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,0.2
"Solana ETF Set to Surpass Ethereum's, While MinePro's $700.000 Presale Attracts Investors During Market Recovery",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/minepro-presale-attracts-investors-during-market-recovery/,2024-08-16,Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide,"Press release about recent ICOs, announcement from startups, new cryptocurrency launch by firms and unlike.

Web3 Giants MinePro, Solana, and Ethereum Making Headlines

The Web3 space is buzzing with excitement as three major projects take center stage: MinePro, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH). MinePro's presale is already making waves, pulling in a solid $700,000 as investors flock to its innovative Bitcoin mining approach. Meanwhile, Solana and Ethereum are poised for significant gains, driven by the anticipation of their respective ETFs. As these developments unfold, they are setting the stage for what could be a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. Let's delve into the latest on Solana and Ethereum before exploring why MinePro is rapidly gaining traction.

Solana (SOL) has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, boasting an impressive 83% rise in 2024 alone and a staggering 667% increase compared to the same period last year. Now, Solana is poised to take another leap forward as analysts anticipate the launch of a Solana-focused Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This potential ETF, expected to offer exposure to Solana's high-speed, low-cost blockchain, could open the floodgates for institutional investment, driving SOL's market cap even higher.

While the exact launch date remains uncertain, the buzz around the Solana ETF is already creating significant market excitement. Analysts from Bitso and Coinext highlight that Solana's unique positioning within decentralized finance (DeFi) and its staking capabilities could make this ETF a game-changer. However, the cryptocurrency market's inherent volatility means that investors should proceed with caution. Despite these risks, the anticipation surrounding the Solana ETF suggests it could be the next big thing in the crypto space, following the recent successes of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Ethereum (ETH) has been making strides to regain its bullish momentum, recently pumping over 4% to trade above $2,740. With a market cap of around $329 billion and daily trading volumes of $13 billion, ETH is inching closer to reclaiming the critical 200 Moving Average (MA) as a support level. However, significant resistance looms at $2,817, where buyers will need to outmatch sellers to push ETH higher. The market sentiment remains cautious, as Ethereum's fear and greed index hovers around 36%, indicating prevailing fear.

The crypto market's mixed reactions have been evident among Ethereum's key players. While some traders remain pessimistic, others, like BlackRock, have continued to show confidence in ETH by purchasing over $49 million worth of the cryptocurrency through its spot Ether ETF, ETHA. Despite the challenges, Ethereum's price action suggests the formation of a bullish ascending triangle, though the $3,000 resistance remains a formidable barrier. As ETH continues to navigate these volatile waters, its performance will be closely watched by investors eyeing the potential of Ethereum ETFs to drive further institutional interest.

As the crypto world continues to evolve, MinePro is emerging as a serious contender in the Bitcoin mining space. The project's presale has already racked up an impressive $700,000, a clear signal that investors are eager to be part of what could be the next big thing in Web3. But what's driving this excitement? MinePro offers something truly unique -- a chance to earn 10-20% monthly profits in Bitcoin by staking its native $MINE token. This isn't just about short-term gains; it's about revolutionizing the way Bitcoin mining works.

At the heart of MinePro's success is its partnership with Logic Mining, which allows the project to lock in electricity rates at an unheard-of 0.02 cents per kWh. This strategic move results in a profitability rate that's 95.71% higher than standard mining operations. But MinePro's vision doesn't stop there. The $MINE token serves as a deflationary governance token, rewarding stakers with Bitcoin and encouraging long-term participation. The longer you stake, the greater your rewards -- making it a compelling option for those looking to maximize their returns.

With $700,000 already secured in its presale, analysts are predicting $MINE will reach $20 by 2025, with a current presale price of $0.03. Early adopters are reaping the benefits of substantial bonus multipliers for staking before the Token Generation Event (TGE), positioning themselves for even greater rewards. This isn't just another presale; it's the start of a new chapter in Bitcoin mining. MinePro is not only breaking the mold but also setting a new standard for what's possible in this space.

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, MinePro, Solana, and Ethereum are paving the way for some big changes. Whether it's the buzz around Solana and Ethereum's ETFs or the game-changing approach of MinePro, these projects are set to make waves in the months ahead. For investors looking to stay ahead of the curve, now is the time to watch these developments closely -- they could be the key to the next big opportunity in the crypto market.",http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/16135214/mine-pro.webp,0.3725490196078431
Cryptocurrencies are relatively new,https://times.mw/cryptocurrencies-are-relatively-new/,2024-09-11,The Times Group Malawi,"DUTTA -- Some believe it will revolutionise the financial system

Cryptocurrency has been a buzzword in the world of finance and technology. However, despite its growing popularity, many people still have questions about what cryptocurrency really is and how it works. Journalist WILLIAM KUMWEMBE engages finance expert Partha Dutta, a chartered accountant, on how cryptocurrencies work.

Firstly, what is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of money that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, such as the US dollar or Euro, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralised networks based on blockchain technology. This means they are not controlled by any central authority, like a government or financial institution, making them free from traditional banking regulations. Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency, and since then, thousands of cryptocurrencies have emerged.

How does cryptocurrency work?

Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, a decentralised ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. When a transaction is made, it is grouped with others in a ""block"" and then verified by a network of computers, known as ""nodes"". Once verified, the block is added to the blockchain, and the transaction is completed. The key to cryptocurrency's security is cryptography, which ensures that transactions are legitimate and that no one can alter or counterfeit the currency. Blockchain's decentralised nature also makes it resistant to hacking or fraud, as there is no single point of failure.

What are some popular cryptocurrencies?

There are a number of them on the market. First is Bitcoin: It was created by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Then there is Ethereum, which is known for its smart contract functionality. It is more than a cryptocurrency; it is a platform for decentralised applications (dApps). And then there is the Ripple. Focused on facilitating cross-border payments, Ripple aims to make financial transactions faster and cheaper, especially in the banking sector.

Why are cryptocurrencies considered volatile?

Cryptocurrency prices are known for their volatility, with prices often experiencing dramatic rises and falls in short periods. This volatility is due to several factors. Firstly, there is market speculation: Cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, and their value can be heavily influenced by speculation. News of regulatory changes, technological developments or influential endorsements can cause sudden price swings. And, also, there is a limited supply: Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have a finite supply. For example, only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. As more people buy and hold cryptocurrency, the limited supply can drive up prices, especially when demand surges. And then there is the element of regulation: Since cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional financial systems, they are not as heavily regulated.

How do I buy cryptocurrency?

To buy cryptocurrency, you typically need to choose a cryptocurrency exchange. Popular platforms include Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. These exchanges allow you to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. And then one needs to create an account. You will need to provide personal information, and depending on the platform, you may be required to verify your identity. The next step is deposit funds: You can usually deposit money via a bank transfer, credit card, or sometimes PayPal. After depositing, you can use these funds to purchase cryptocurrencies. From there, you can store your cryptocurrency. Once you have purchased cryptocurrency, you'll need to store it. You can keep it on the exchange or transfer it to a private wallet (software or hardware) for added security.

What are the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency?

While cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with significant risks. They include market volatility. As mentioned earlier, cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to potential losses for investors. Also, there are security risks associated with it. Despite the security of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacking. If an exchange is hacked, or if users lose access to their wallets, recovering their funds can be difficult, if not impossible. Further, there are regulatory uncertainties. Governments are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies. New regulations or crackdowns could affect the value and legality of certain digital assets. Last but not the least is the element of fraud and scams. The lack of regulation and anonymity associated with cryptocurrency has led to an increase in fraudulent schemes. Investors need to be cautious and avoid scams, such as fake initial coin offerings or Ponzi schemes.

Why are people investing in cryptocurrencies?

There are several reasons people are drawn to cryptocurrencies: firstly, there is potential for high returns: Many early investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen substantial gains. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, which means they can rise (or fall) in value rapidly, offering the potential for significant profit. Also, there is a sense of decentralisation. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of governments and central banks, appealing to people who value financial independence and privacy. There is a hedge against inflation: Some investors view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as ""digital gold"" because they are limited in supply. This can make them attractive as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Another vital aspect is technological innovation: Many are investing not only in the currency but also in the underlying blockchain technology, which has wide applications beyond digital money, such as in supply chain management, voting systems and healthcare.

What is the future of cryptocurrency?

The future of cryptocurrency is a hot topic. Some believe it will revolutionise the financial system, while others are more skeptical.

Innovating Finance: Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Insights | Technology Org,https://moguldom.com/459157/the-evolution-and-impact-of-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology/,2024-09-13,Moguldom,"Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary digital currency secured through cryptography, operating independently of central authorities. Enabled by blockchain technology, a decentralized ledger system, guarantees transparent, secure, and immutable transactions. This system records transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency and preventing you from fraud or manipulation.

Historical Background (Origins of Bitcoin)

Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by the mysterious figure Satoshi Nakamoto, marked the start of cryptocurrencies. Designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin aimed to provide an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply captivated early adopters, laying the groundwork for a new era of digital finance.

Bitcoin's early adoption included instances like the purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC by Laszlo Hanyecz on May 22, 2010, now valued at millions of dollars, illustrating both its early adoption and the substantial appreciation in value over time and is now celebrated annually by the cryptocurrency community as ""Bitcoin Pizza Day.""

Importance and Relevance in Today's Digital Economy

In today's digital economy, cryptocurrencies offer several advantages over traditional banking systems. They facilitate decentralized transactions, promoting financial inclusion and reducing dependence on intermediaries. Elon Musk's endorsement and involvement in cryptocurrency markets, particularly with Tesla's acceptance of Bitcoin for vehicle purchases (though later withdrawn due to environmental issues), highlighted its growing mainstream appeal and volatility.

Understanding Blockchain Technology

Blockchain serves as the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, revolutionizing the way transactions are verified and stored. It operates as a distributed ledger where data is grouped into blocks, each linked cryptographically to the previous one, forming a chain.

Definition and Fundamental Principles

Blockchain ensures transactional integrity through decentralization, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms. Decentralization means transactions are verified by a network of nodes rather than a central authority, ensuring transparency and resilience against fraud. Cryptography secures data through encryption techniques, while consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) validate transactions and maintain the blockchain's integrity.

Types of Blockchains

Key Components of Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency relies on cryptographic principles and secure wallet management for transactions. Public and private keys authenticate transactions, with public keys serving as addresses for receiving funds and private keys ensuring secure access. Hash functions maintain blockchain integrity by uniquely identifying each block. CryptoWallets like Ledger Nano and software options such as MetaMask manage these keys, enabling secure storage and transaction capabilities. Cryptocurrency addresses derived from public keys facilitate safe fund transfers, each address generated through cryptographic processes to ensure security and uniqueness.

Major Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin and Ethereum stand as crucial cryptocurrencies in the digital realm that have significantly shaped the digital economy and technological landscape.

Bitcoin, introduced as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, marked a breakthrough in financial innovation. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins and status as digital cash has made it a deflationary asset, subject to dramatic market fluctuations influenced in part by Elon Musk's public statements. Despite regulatory hurdles and environmental concerns regarding its energy-intensive mining, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum, building on Bitcoin's foundations, introduced smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), revolutionizing digital transactions. Smart contracts automate agreements, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications for lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Ethereum 2.0 addresses scalability through a transition to the energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and innovations like sharding, aiming to enhance transaction speed and accommodate increased demand for decentralized applications.

Applications of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency

Blockchain technology expands beyond cryptocurrency, offering transparency, efficiency, and security across various sectors. In supply chain management, blockchain ensures traceability and authenticity, reducing fraud and enhancing ethical sourcing practices.

In financial services, blockchain powers decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Smart contracts automate lending, borrowing, and trading, granting users greater control over their assets. Stablecoins, like Tether and USD Coin, mitigate cryptocurrency volatility, providing stable transaction mediums and hedging tools. These applications highlight blockchain's ability to revolutionize financial systems and ensure stability in digital economies.

Challenges and Concerns

Despite its potential benefits, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies face several challenges that hinder widespread adoption and integration into mainstream industries.

Blockchain scalability remains a significant challenge, limiting transaction throughput and speed across networks. High transaction fees and network congestion during peak periods pose usability challenges for users and developers alike.

Blockchain's security vulnerabilities, including 51% attacks and double-spending, pose risks to network integrity and user trust. Regulatory uncertainties and varying legal frameworks globally impact cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain applications, hindering market growth and innovation.

Future Outlook and Trends

Looking ahead, blockchain's integration in e-commerce could streamline transactions for specialized products like car magnets. Stay informed about advancements -- learn more about car magnets here.

Blockchain technology continues to evolve with advancements like layer 2 solutions and interoperability, such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Ethereum's state channels, which aim to improve transaction speed and scalability.

These developments enable interoperable blockchains that facilitate seamless data exchange across networks, fostering innovation and ecosystem growth. Additionally, blockchain's integration with IoT and AI enhances automation and data security. Smart contracts enable autonomous transactions within IoT systems, while blockchain-based AI solutions enhance data integrity and transparency. Institutions like banks and governments are increasingly exploring blockchain's potential to streamline operations and enhance transparency beyond cryptocurrencies.

Regulatory advancements are important in building institutional trust and supporting blockchain integration in traditional financial and administrative systems. Furthermore, blockchain's disruptive potential extends across sectors like healthcare, supply chain management, and entertainment, offering solutions to enhance efficiency, accountability, and sustainability through decentralized and secure systems.

Embracing the Future: Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Forging a Path

The evolution of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology highlights a future rich with innovation and transformative potential. As these technologies mature and address scalability, security, and regulatory challenges, they hold the promise of creating a more secure, efficient, and inclusive digital economy for us.

"How to buy bitcoin, ether and other crypto ETFs with more security and less risk",https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240911860/how-to-buy-bitcoin-ether-and-other-crypto-etfs-with-more-security-and-less-risk,2024-09-11,Morningstar,"Crypto ETFs are safer than owning cryptocurrencies outright - but you're still in unknown territory

With the rise of cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded funds, many investors believe they've found a safer way to dip into the volatile world of bitcoin (BTCUSD), ether (ETHUSD) and other digital assets. While crypto ETFs offer a layer of protection direct crypto investment lacks, they're not without their own set of risks. Here's what you need to know to protect your crypto holdings:

1. Keep it real: Investing in crypto through ETFs is generally safer than holding cryptocurrencies directly. You're not dealing with digital wallets, private keys or the risk of crypto-exchange hacks. Yet this apparent safety net can lull investors into a false sense of security. Remember, the underlying assets are still highly volatile, and this volatility will be reflected in the ETF's value.

During the bitcoin price crash of 2022, for example, when the popular crypto's value plunged more than 60% from its all-time high, ETFs tracking bitcoin's price saw similar declines. While ETFs protect you from some crypto-specific risks, they don't insulate you from market volatility.

2. Understand what you're buying: When you buy a crypto ETF, you're not getting a standard financial product. You're investing in a fund that holds or tracks cryptocurrencies or blockchain-related companies. You need to know how crypto trading operates. For instance, if your ETF is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, a sudden regulatory crackdown on bitcoin mining could significantly impact your investment. Similarly, a major security flaw discovered in Ethereum could tank the value of ETFs with large ether holdings.

Some crypto ETFs include stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology - ranging from crypto exchanges such as Coinbase Global (COIN) and mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), to Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech giants investing in blockchain. Publicly traded companies come with their own risks and potential rewards.

Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto ETFs face unique challenges when it comes to asset custody. The companies holding the actual cryptocurrencies for the ETF (known as custodians) are a potential point of failure. If a custodian's security is breached, it could lead to significant losses for the ETF and, by extension, your investment.

3. Custody matters: Always research the custodial arrangements of any crypto ETF you're considering. Look for ETFs that use reputable custodians with a track record of strong security measures, including cold storage for assets and comprehensive insurance policies.

Here's what to ask about an ETF's custodian:

What security measures are in place? Have they ever experienced a security breach? If so, how was it handled?Are multisignature wallets in use? What portion of assets is held in cold storage versus hot wallets? What insurance policies do they have, and what exactly do these policies cover?

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still in development, and this uncertainty extends to crypto ETFs. A sudden regulatory change could force an ETF to quickly sell off assets, potentially at unfavorable prices. In extreme cases, regulatory shifts could even lead to the delisting of an ETF.

Stay informed about the regulatory environment in the countries where your ETF operates. Be prepared for the possibility that rules could change rapidly, affecting your investment.

Consider these scenarios:

A country bans cryptocurrency mining, affecting the profitability of mining companies in your ETF's portfolio.New tax regulations are introduced, impacting the ETF's returns or reporting requirements.Stricter know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) rules are implemented, potentially limiting the ETF's ability to trade certain assets.

4. Liquidity trap: Crypto ETFs can face liquidity issues, especially during times of market stress. If a large number of investors try to sell their ETF shares simultaneously, the fund might struggle to sell its crypto holdings fast enough to meet redemption demands. This could lead to the ETF trading at a significant discount to its net asset value. Before investing, check the liquidity of the ETF and its underlying assets. Larger, more established funds tend to have better liquidity.

Here are some factors that can affect an ETF's liquidity:

Trading volume: Higher daily trading volumes generally indicate better liquidity.Assets under management: Larger funds usually have better liquidity.Spread: A narrow bid-ask spread often indicates good liquidity.Creation/redemption process: Understand how the ETF creates and redeems shares, as this can impact liquidity.

5. New scams: While crypto ETFs protect you from many traditional cryptocurrency scams, they've given rise to a new breed of fraudulent activities. Watch out for:

Fake ETFs: Scammers create fraudulent ETFs that mimic legitimate ones. Always verify an ETF's legitimacy through official channels like the SEC's EDGAR database.

Sophisticated phishing: Instead of trying to steal your crypto wallet keys, scammers might impersonate your broker or the ETF company to gain access to your investment account. These attacks can be highly targeted. For example, a scammer might use information from your social-media profiles to craft a convincing impersonation of your financial adviser, then try to persuade you to transfer funds or share account details.

Deepfake dangers: Some scammers use deepfake technology to impersonate financial advisers or ETF executives. Always verify the identity of anyone asking you to make investment decisions, especially if they're pressuring you to act quickly.

Pump-and-dump schemes: While not exclusive to ETFs, pump-and-dump schemes can target smaller or newer crypto ETFs. Scammers might spread false information to inflate the price of an ETF or its underlying assets, then sell their holdings once the price has risen.

Front-running: This is when someone with advance knowledge of a large pending transaction uses that information for their own profit. In the context of ETFs, an unethical insider might use knowledge of the ETF's rebalancing schedule to trade the underlying assets beforehand.

Tracking error

Crypto ETFs, especially those using futures contracts rather than holding cryptocurrencies directly, can suffer from tracking error. This means the ETF's performance may not perfectly mirror the performance of the underlying assets it's meant to track.

Factors contributing to tracking error include:

Management fees Transaction costsDifferences between spot and futures prices (for futures-based ETFs)Rebalancing frequency

Protecting your portfolio

How can you safeguard your investments? Here are some key steps:

1. Do your homework: Thoroughly research any ETF before investing. Understand its holdings, management team and track record. Look into the fund's prospectus, which will detail its investment strategy, risks and fees. Pay attention to the expense ratio; while crypto ETFs tend to have higher fees than traditional ETFs, excessive fees can eat into your returns.

2. Secure your brokerage account: Use strong, unique passwords and hardware-based two-factor authentication. Be wary of using public wifi for accessing your investment accounts.

3. Stay informed: Keep up with news about the cryptocurrencies your ETF holds and any regulatory developments. Follow reputable financial news sources and consider setting up alerts for news related to your investments.

4. Diversify: Don't concentrate your portfolio. Crypto ETFs should be part of a diversified portfolio, not your main investment strategy. Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when deciding what portion of your portfolio to allocate to crypto ETFs.

5. Be skeptical: If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be especially wary of unsolicited investment advice or pressure to act quickly. Take the time to verify information independently before making any investment decisions.

6. Understand the tax implications: Crypto ETF investments can have complex tax implications. Consult with a tax professional to understand how your investments might affect your tax situation.

7. Use reputable brokers: Only invest through well-known, regulated brokers. Check their credentials and read reviews from other users.

8. Monitor investments regularly: Keep an eye on your ETF's performance and any changes in its underlying assets or management strategy. However, avoid the temptation to make knee-jerk reactions to short-term market movements.

By understanding these unique challenges and taking proactive steps, you can navigate the crypto ETF landscape safely and confidently. Remember, in the world of investing, knowledge isn't just power - it's protection.

The Security Hustle: Protecting My Bitcoin From Hackers,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-security-hustle-protecting-my-bitcoin-from-hackers,2024-08-28,Bitcoin Magazine,"Bitcoin is a highly desirable asset to hackers. This extensive guide will help you protect your funds as a Bitcoin investor.

Bitcoin, the world's first and leading cryptocurrency, has proven its mettle in its roughly fifteen years of existence. From 2011 to 2021, it was the world's best-performing asset class in eight of the last eleven years. At the end of 2023, it reemerged as the world's top-performing asset class.

It is also a trillion-dollar asset. BTC's market capitalization is at $1.13 trillion as of this writing. This value is outside the overall crypto market cap and excludes all other crypto coins. From a fledgling currency in 2008, its value has risen from nearly zero to over $73,000, reaching a historical all-time high in 2024.

Bitcoin has minted many new millionaires and several billionaires. Famous founders of multi-billion dollar corporations involved in crypto include Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance, and Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy.

With such a meteoric rise, it's hardly surprising that hackers keep trying to find ways to steal Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin owner, protecting your assets from cyber threats is critical. Here, we explore how BTC holders can protect their coins across platforms and activities.

The Current BTC Security Landscape

Hacks and losses in the crypto sphere are nothing new. In the second quarter of 2024 alone, the crypto ecosystem lost about $572.7 million due to fraudulent attacks and hacks. The figure is up 112 percent compared to the same period last year.

The year's most significant BTC hack so far is that of DMM Bitcoin, a Japanese crypto trading platform. On May 31, 2024, DMM Bitcoin lost around $305 million worth of BTC.

Moreover, the year-to-date (YTD) losses from crypto fraud and hacks have reached $920.9 million -- up 24 percent from $720 million the previous year. May and June have seen exceptionally high losses, making up $358.5 million of total crypto incidents. Centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 70 percent of all losses.

Hacking vs. fraud analysis: Hacks cause 98.5 percent of losses

According to a report by Immunefi, a leading bug bounty platform, hacks are responsible for most crypto losses. As of the second quarter of 2024, hacks remain the predominant cause of losses versus fraud. Fraud accounts for only 1.5 percent of the overall crypto losses in Q2 2024. Hacks, on the other hand, account for 98.5 percent.

In Q2 2024, the crypto ecosystem lost $564,238,811 to hacks spread across 53 incidents. This figure represents a 155 percent increase versus Q2 2023 when losses caused by hacks amounted to less than half: $220,522,129.

Fraud-related loss in Q2 2024 was $8,450,050, spread across 19 specific incidents. These numbers represent a decrease of 81 percent compared to the same period last year.

Bitcoin hackings you should know about

Despite advancements in blockchain technology and security measures, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain vulnerable to hacking and security breaches.

To understand how Bitcoin hacks happen, you should understand their progression and history. Here, we examine some of the most significant Bitcoin hacks and analyze what went wrong.

In September 2020, Singapore-based KuCoin, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a security breach. The intrusion resulted in the theft of over $280 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including 1008 Bitcoin. The hackers gained access to the exchange's hot wallets by exploiting weaknesses in its security protocols. According to KuCoin's CEO, its cold wallets were unaffected.

In retrospect, enhanced security audits to identify vulnerabilities could have prevented the hack. It could also have been mitigated by using multi-signature or multisig wallets for the exchange's hot storage and storing the more significant portion of assets in cold storage to minimize the accessible amount.

This Kucoin hack is not the first of it's kind and certainly not the last. Just in June 2024 Kraken's chief security officer disclosed ""extremely critical"" zero-day flaw in Kraken's platform to steal $3M dollars. Here is how it was described:

The 'security researcher' disclosed this bug to two other individuals who they work with who fraudulently generated much larger sums. They ultimately withdrew nearly $3 million from their Kraken accounts... They demanded a call with their business development team (i.e. their sales reps) and have not agreed to return any funds until we provide a speculated $ amount that this bug could have caused if they had not disclosed it. This is not white-hat hacking; it is extortion!

Coinbase is one of the most trusted platforms in the Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem. It is particularly dominant in the USA. As of this writing, Coinbase handles billions of dollars in transactions and has a market cap of $55.24 billion.

The first significant breach that shook Coinbase and the crypto community occurred in 2019. The hack showed the ingenuity of the attackers. It was also a wake-up call for the whole cryptosphere, as it was more sophisticated than anyone expected.

The attackers accessed Coinbase's internal systems using a sophisticated phishing campaign. They targeted employees with spear-phishing emails carefully crafted to appear legitimate communications from a trusted source.

Over a dozen Coinbase employees initially received an email from Gregory Harris, supposedly a Research Grants Administrator at the University of Cambridge in the UK. The first email was dated May 30, 2019.

According to Coinbase, the email came from the legitimate Cambridge domain. It had no apparent malicious elements, passed spam detection, and appeared from a knowledgeable source, referencing the recipients' backgrounds. Over the two weeks, the address continued sending emails, and nothing seemed amiss.

The attacker sent a follow-up email on June 17. This time, the new email contained a malicious URL. If opened via a Firefox browser, it would install malware that could take over the target user's computer. According to Coinbase's security team, the emails were part of a ""sophisticated, highly targeted, thought out"" attack.

Upon entering the network, the hackers moved laterally to escalate their access privileges. They exploited a Firefox zero-day vulnerability -- an issue that had not yet been patched. Moreover, the attacks used not one but two Firefox zero-days, according to Philip Martin, the company's chief information security officer, in 2019. Coinbase reported the attacks to Mozilla.

The vulnerability enabled the hackers to gain administrative access to the exchange's backend network and critical systems, including databases for storing user information and private keys. In other words, a successful attack would allow a hacker to steal funds from the exchange. The tactic has been used numerous times and led to gigantic losses in crypto exchanges.

This particular hack was unique because the attackers demonstrated remarkable patience and precision. They chose a more calculated, insidious, and covert approach over a swift and noisy attack.

However, the breach was eventually detected. During a routine security audit, Coinbase's security team noticed unusual patterns of withdrawals. They launched an investigation and discovered the breach. They then acted swiftly to contain the damage. They secured the compromised systems, patched the exploited vulnerabilities, and enhanced their monitoring capabilities.

After the hack, Coinbase publicly disclosed its details and mechanics. They assured users and the broader crypto community that the company's insurance policy covered most of the stolen funds and that no customer funds would be lost.

Nonetheless, the incident had far-reaching implications. It highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in even the most secure platforms and underscored the need to continuously improve cybersecurity practices.

The Coinbase security team walked back the entire attack, contained it, and reported the zero-day to Firefox.

The second breach that affected Coinbase was in late 2021. It involved the theft of approximately $100 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including BTC. Coinbase detected a platform vulnerability that enabled hackers to exploit a flaw in the crypto transfer process. The vulnerability led to unauthorized transactions and financial losses for some users on the platform.

Though it happened further back in the past, the Bitfinex hack is worth mentioning due to its magnitude. Hackers stole 119,756 BTC, valued at around $72 million. Today, based on the BTC price as of this writing, the same amount of BTC would be roughly $6.5 billion.

This particular hack occurred due to vulnerabilities in the multi-signature security system that Bitfinex employed in collaboration with BitGo. It could have been avoided by using advanced authentication protocols, user behavior monitoring, and segregated wallet structures to limit exposure.

BTC Security: Who should care?

Bitcoin security affects large coin holders and average ones alike. Bitcoin is used for different purposes, not just as a plain vanilla investment tool you buy and hold. It can be a payment vehicle or trading instrument.

It can be used as collateral and an underlying asset for various derivatives and derivative-like products. Its value and use cases are expanding as it is now used as the underlying for large-scale ETFs. Thus, you want to ensure your wallet is safe to protect your spending or day-trading money.

According to Chainalysis, the number of unique Bitcoin addresses has ballooned to 460 million. While it is impossible to determine how many people own Bitcoin accurately, we can estimate its popularity based on the number of generated addresses over the years.

We can also gauge active users through the number of wallets with active balances. According to BitInfoCharts, a blockchain analysis firm, over 67 million wallet addresses have a balance of $1 or more. Of these addresses, 40.5 million have a balance between $1 and $100, showing that most Bitcoin holders have a small amount of money invested.

Prominent American entrepreneur Tom Lee predicts that BTC could rally to $150,000 in the coming months. Lee claimed that the asset's valuation has been negatively affected lately due to the issues related to the now-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox.

The Mt. Goz ""overhang,"" as he calls it, brought down the price due to the long overdue payouts from its bankruptcy proceedings, paying back thousands of users up to almost $9 billion in assets. He expects the overhang to disappear sometime in July.

Your small investment could yield appreciable returns if you buy and hold. Because of its long-term potential, security should matter to all BTC holders.

The security of an individual also affects the ecosystem. KYC hacks and leaks affect an individual's privacy and identity, enabling malicious attackers to trace their activities. Such hacks can also be detrimental at the large investor or institutional level, leading to massive losses or draining the funds of individual investors signed up on a platform.

In addition, BTC and crypto losses negatively impact the markets. Therefore, security is a shared responsibility of BTC holders of all sizes.

The Importance of Using Secure Platforms

Given its high price and widespread appeal, BTC remains a target for hackers. If you are invested in Bitcoin, choosing a secure platform for buying and storing Bitcoin is crucial for protecting your investments.

Crypto custody solutions

Crypto custody solutions are businesses providing third-party crypto asset security and storage services. They mainly target accredited investors or institutions with significant Bitcoin or crypto holdings. Such clients include hedge funds, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchanges.

These custody solutions generally combine hot and cold storage. Hot storage keeps you connected, but cold storage ensures your assets are safely offline.

Dealing with crypto custody solutions providers requires understanding various crypto security procedures, hot and cold wallets, multisig solutions, and other best practices to ensure your crypto is safe.

Which platform offers the best BTC storage and security?

The answer to this question depends on your needs as a Bitcoin investor or holder. If you wish to buy BTC, you have several reliable options.

According to investment strategist Lyn Alden, you can use Swan Bitcoin to buy BTC. Beyond a place to make one-time or recurring purchases for dollar-cost averaging (DCA), you should consider it as a Bitcoin accumulation platform. Swan provides Bitcoin IRA services for those investors who are serious about accumulating wealth long term.

Fees for all trades are 0.99 percent of each purchase. They do this without taking a spread on your purchase, too, and the first $10,000 worth of BTC has zero fees.

Some notable security-related features include free auto-withdrawal to a self-custody address. Keeping your BTC with Swan's custodian is also free, and you can access it through them with the BTC held in your name.

One simple yet ingenious way to use these features is to dollar cost average DCA into Bitcoin utilizing a plan that automatically buys BTC at regular intervals. The platform can also send it to your hardware wallet or another secure custody solution.

According to their website, all Swan data is encrypted with military-grade AES-256 encryption, and traffic on the site is encrypted with industry-standard TLSv1.2 encryption. Moreover, Swan does not have access to nor store private keys for BTC that are stored with its custodial partners.

Currently, Bakkt and Fortress Trust are the custodians of record. BitGo is its cold storage custodian.

Some would consider Swan Bitcoin a Coinbase alternative for buying and storing BTC in the US. While Coinbase is the dominant player in the exchange business, Swan simplifies BTC investment for retail and institutional investors.

Essential Security Tips To Safeguard Your BTC

The persistent attempts to hack BTC are a stark reminder of the ever-present risks lurking in the digital world. For users, it underscores the importance of personal security measures. Among these are enabling two-factor authentication and using hardware wallets for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies.

The following are some concepts and tips that will help you protect your BTC holdings:

Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides a second or additional layer of account security by requiring a second form of ownership verification outside your password. It is best defined as a process that increases the likelihood that a person is who they say they are.

Rather than simply using a username and password, the 2FA process requests users to provide two authentication factors before accessing a crypto-related wallet, app, or platform.

Organizations must use 2FA to protect their data and users in the face of a high-risk cybersecurity landscape, specifically in BTC and crypto, wherein you can expect a higher volume of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.

One helpful way to frame 2FA is as a process that encourages people and organizations to stop solely relying on passwords to enter applications and websites.

With 2FA, cybercriminals have more difficulty stealing users' identities or accessing their devices. The measure also helps organizations fend off attackers, even when a password has been stolen from one or several users.

Companies and individuals are using 2FA to prevent common cyber threats. These include phishing attacks that use users' passwords and spoof targets' identities after gaining credentials.

Setting up 2FA for Bitcoin

To set up 2FA for your BTC wallet, download a trustworthy authenticator like Authy, Google Authenticator, or other comparable apps.

Access your BTC account and look for the 2FA section. Click ""Enable 2FA"". Link your account to the authenticator app by selecting ""Scan QR Code"" or ""Add Account"" on Google Authenticator. Afterward, scan the QR code shown on the BTC or crypto platform.

Some systems provide additional backup codes called recovery keys. These codes are vital for account retrieval. You must store these codes in a safe location. If you misplace or lose your device with the corresponding authenticator app, you can use the backup codes to recover your Bitcoin wallet or account access.

To complete your setup, you must enter the time-based one-time password (OTP) generated by the authenticator app when asked by your BTC or crypto platform.

Log out of your account and try to re-access it to test your 2FA setup. This time, the wallet, app, or platform should ask you for an OTP from your authenticator app.

Other 2FA techniques utilize SMS or email verification. While these are better than nothing, they are less safe and vulnerable to more attacks. SMS is susceptible to SIM-swapping attacks. Utilizing an authenticator app is deemed more secure.

Hardware-based 2FA is a more stringent security measure that involves physical devices like YubiKey for verification. However, authenticator apps will do very well for regular everyday use.

Ensure that your authenticator app is up to date and that your recovery keys are kept in a safe place, preferably offline.

Hot vs. cold wallets

As a BTC holder, you must understand the difference between hot and cold crypto wallets. Hot wallets are software that stores your BTC private keys on a device that's online or connected to the Internet. They are convenient and easily accessible via online devices like mobile phones, tablets, or laptops.

Hot wallets often have more activity -- they usually handle smaller, more frequent BTC transactions -- and are convenient for trading. However, because they are online, they are vulnerable to hacks.

On the other hand, cold wallets aren't connected to other devices or the Internet, making them less vulnerable to hacks and a more secure method of storing BTC private keys.

Cold wallets are usually hardware devices that resemble modified USB sticks or mini plastic cards with buttons and screens. They cost between $50 and about $300, although they could be more expensive. Popular brands include Ledger and Trezor.

Cold wallets like paper or metal wallets that record your private keys can be more straightforward. Their enhanced security is derived from their being offline. To trade funds from a cold wallet, you need to move them to a hot wallet that's connected to a crypto exchange.

When you set up your hardware wallet, remember to write down your recovery seed phrase on paper and store it offline in a highly secure location. Please do not share this information with anyone or store it digitally.

Stay updated with the latest security measures

The Bitcoin and crypto space are continually evolving, and so are the hacking methods that threaten them. Thus, it is crucial to stay abreast of the latest security measures.

Keep all your software updated to protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Read reputable sources for updates and security news.

Protecting Your BTC Requires a Proactive Approach

In a dynamic tech and crypto sphere, the only way to stay ahead of hackers is to be proactive about your security. Ensure you have all the basics covered: choosing a secure platform, enabling two-factor authentication, and using cold storage or hardware wallets to protect your BTC wealth.

However, as hacks and exploits become more sophisticated, you can only fully secure your BTC when constantly updated on the latest security news. Also, ensure that your platforms and apps are continually on top of threats. If you are a buy-and-hold investor, ensure that your BTC funds are in cold storage.

Security in BTC can be effectively summarized by the old and oft-quoted adage from the early days of Bitcoin: ""Not your keys, not your coins."" Make sure you have ultimate control over your private keys. And if you do choose a platform to hold them temporarily or entrust them with custody, understand the nuances of the agreement and infrastructure.

Bitcoin was meant to be decentralized, so the more autonomous you are about managing your keys, the better security you have.",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA4ODkwMTU2MTA5ODAxMjU1/security.png,0.3568627450980393
Render Token Price Prediction: Is Render Price Aiming For Bearish Pullback?,https://blockchainreporter.net/price-prediction/render-token/,2024-08-21,blockchainreporter,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) represent two rapidly expanding sectors in the blockchain arena. AI in this context refers to decentralized applications (DApps) that utilize AI algorithms to support a range of functionalities, while DePINs focus on blockchain-enabled decentralized exchanges of computing resources. Among the frontrunners in these sectors is Render Network (RENDER), which began on Ethereum (ETH) in 2020 before transitioning to Solana (SOL). This move enabled the decentralized exchange of GPU computing power, primarily for processing graphics rendering and AI tasks. Since opening to the public in April 2020, Render Network has gained significant traction as a go-to DApp for 3D graphics and animation rendering. In 2023, the project notably expanded to include AI computations. Following this, it made a significant shift from Ethereum to Solana, changing its native token from the Ethereum-based RNDR to the Solana-based RENDER. In this article, we'll explore Render token price prediction with an in-depth analysis of the RNDR token price and its future market sentiment.

Render Network (RENDER) is a blockchain-powered platform that supports the decentralized trading of GPU power, catering to both computer rendering and AI applications. Initially launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2020 under the cryptocurrency ticker RNDR, it transitioned to the Solana blockchain in late 2023 and adopted RENDER as its new Solana-based token.

The platform connects Node Operators, who offer up their computers' idle GPU processing power, with Creators who need additional resources to handle computer rendering and AI tasks. This peer-to-peer setup aims to democratize access to rendering and AI processing, making these technologies more available to a broader range of creators. Computer rendering involves converting basic 2D graphic models into detailed 3D or 2D visual outputs or animations, a process that demands high-performance computing power.

Often, the requisite hardware is prohibitively expensive, pushing smaller studios and individual creators to either extend their financial limits or forego quality. Centralized GPU cloud rendering services, while available, often lack flexibility and affordability.

Through Render Network, Creators can access necessary hardware resources on a cost-effective, pay-as-you-go basis, while GPU owners have the opportunity to monetize their unused capacity by earning cryptocurrency rewards.

Render Network was established in California in 2017 by OTOY Inc., a pioneering company in cloud rendering, which was founded in 2008. OTOY is known for developing OctaneRender, the first unbiased and spectrally accurate rendering software globally. The platform went public in April 2020 and swiftly became a dominant force in the web3 computer rendering space. By 2023, Render Network expanded its capabilities to include AI computations, enhancing its primary focus on graphics rendering.

Render Network not only stands as the preeminent leader in decentralized computer rendering but also ranks among the top web3 platforms across several rapidly expanding sectors: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), AI, and the metaverse.

Initially launched on Ethereum, Render Network made a strategic move to Solana's blockchain in late 2023, capitalizing on Solana's enhanced scalability and reduced transaction costs. The network features three pricing tiers: Tier 1 caters to enterprise clients requiring large-scale, custom services; Tier 2, though more costly, prioritizes performance and speed; and Tier 3 offers accessible options for general users.

The network revolves around two primary participants: Creators and Node Operators. Creators range from individual freelancers to large Hollywood studios, all seeking access to substantial GPU resources for rendering projects. They engage with the network through a tiered pricing model. Another vital role is played by liquidity providers who support the network's liquidity by staking RENDER tokens in partnered exchange pools, integral to the network's Burn and Mint Equilibrium system.

Node Operators, formerly known as mining nodes, allocate their GPU power in return for RENDER tokens. They must satisfy specific hardware requirements and their job allocations hinge on a reputation system, which takes into account their success rate and the complexity of completed jobs.

Reputation scores are pivotal in Render Network's decentralized trading of GPU resources. Both Creators and Node Operators receive scores based on their transaction history on the platform. High scores for Creators unlock more GPU resources, while Node Operators with superior scores gain access to more lucrative job opportunities.

The network employs a multi-variable system to assign rendering and AI processing tasks, considering factors like reputation scores, hardware specifications, network tenure, chosen pricing tier, and OctaneBench scores. OctaneBench measures GPU rendering capacity, with higher scores indicating more robust performance capabilities.

Render Network serves a wide array of industries, from gaming and film to product design and AI. It is especially beneficial in fields requiring high-performance computing like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications in gaming, as well as in projection mapping and simulations in large venues.

In the realm of product design and architecture, Render Network enables rapid prototyping of 3D models, enhancing both the speed and quality of production workflows. Additionally, its capabilities extend to AI, where through the Render Network SDK, developers can utilize decentralized GPU resources for diverse AI computational tasks.

Render Network initially launched its application on Ethereum, utilizing RNDR as its native cryptocurrency, conforming to the ERC-20 standard for fungible crypto assets. In late 2023, the Render Network community elected to transition the platform to Solana, introducing a new native cryptocurrency, RENDER, aligned with Solana's SPL format. RNDR holders have the option to exchange their tokens for RENDER on a one-to-one basis.

RENDER represents an advanced iteration of RNDR, incorporating escrow smart contract functionality to securely hold payment tokens for Node Operators until a Creator's job is verified as complete.

While RENDER has largely taken over the roles of payment, governance, and other crucial functions within the network, RNDR retains a significant user base. Despite its historical popularity, many investors have yet to switch their holdings to RENDER. By August 2024, most centralized crypto exchanges are actively converting, or have already converted, RNDR assets to RENDER for their customers.

Now, let's review some pivotal moments in Render's price history. While historical performance is not a reliable indicator of future outcomes, understanding the coin's past behavior can provide valuable context for making or evaluating Render price predictions.

2020: Render Network was launched to the public on April 27, 2020. During its inaugural year, the token experienced rapid fluctuations, starting at $0.04677 on June 13 and peaking at $0.2699 by August 27. It ended the year on a recovery note, trading at approximately $0.1827 in December.

2021: The year began sluggishly for Render, with its price at $0.1171 on January 29. However, momentum picked up quickly, with the token price escalating to $2.5 by March 27.

2022: The year saw significant volatility, as RNDR dropped to $1.98 on January 22, then surged to $3.84 by February 6, only to experience a 70% decline in the second quarter.

2023: Throughout 2023, Render's highest price was $2.7, with its value remaining relatively subdued for the rest of the year.

2024: A notable surge in the crypto market in March 2024 propelled RNDR to $13.15, reaching an all-time high of $13.6. However, the price declined gradually and is currently hovering below $5.

Render has been fluctuating between the 50-day SMA and the support level of $4.2 recently. Buyers are struggling to push the price beyond $5 as selling pressure intensifies around the resistance channels. As of writing, RENDER price trades at $4.5, surging over 4.25% in the last 24 hours.

The downward-sloping 20-day EMA ($4.5) and the RSI slightly around the midpoint suggest a slight advantage for the bears. For the bulls to take control, they need to push the price above the 50-day SMA. Achieving this could propel the RENDER/USDT pair to $5 and potentially $7.

Conversely, if the price declines from its current position or the moving averages, the bears will attempt to lower and maintain the pair beneath $4.2. Success in this effort could see the pair drop to $3.4.

RENDER is used for service fee payments within the Render Network and for compensating GPU power suppliers. Additionally, it serves as the reward mechanism for liquidity providers. Creators can choose to pay for processing power on the network using either RENDER tokens or fiat currency. Node Operators receive RENDER as payment for leasing out their hardware's processing capacity. Moreover, liquidity providers earn an extra percentage of RENDER by staking their tokens in liquidity pools on associated exchanges.

Experts anticipate the Render token's price will not dip below $7.85 in 2024. It could peak at $8.63, with an average trading figure around $8.12 throughout the year.

Render Network has implemented a Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) system to stabilize costs for Creators by aligning the RENDER token's price with supply and demand dynamics. In this system, Creators convert fiat to RENDER through distributed liquidity pools to pay for AI and rendering jobs. This process risks inflating RENDER's supply. To counteract this, RENDER tokens used for payments are burned.

Each week, the token emission for that epoch is recalculated based on network activity. Creators receive a refund in RENDER for a portion of their expenditures each epoch, promoting continued network engagement. Node operators earn rewards for their availability and for successfully completing jobs. Liquidity providers benefit from staking RENDER in liquidity pools on partnered exchanges.

To sustain long-term rewards for network participants, Render Network recycles some of the burned RENDER each epoch. This measure ensures reward availability even after the RENDER supply cap is reached.

According to projections and technical assessments, Render's value is expected to bottom out at $11.14 in 2025. It may climb to a high of $13.32, averaging $11.47 in trading value.

Predictions for 2026 suggest that Render's value will bottom at $16.20. It could escalate to a high of $19.27, with the year's average price hovering around $16.66.

Based on technical forecasts, the 2027 outlook for Render predicts a minimum price of $23.77. The price is poised to hit a maximum of $27.66, averaging at $24.44 for the year.

Forecasts for 2028 predict that Render will reach a minimum trading price of $32.60. The maximum price could surge to $40.66, with an average price of $33.82 throughout the year.

Technical analysis of past RNDR data indicates that by 2029, Render's price is expected to hover around a minimum of $48.90. It might rise to a maximum of $56.74, averaging $50.59 in trading price.

The minimum forecast price for Render in 2030 is $67.49. It has the potential to reach a high of $83.91, with an average yearly trading price of $70.02.

In 2031, Render's price is predicted to bottom out at $99.23. It could rise to a peak of $117.48, with an average price of $102.73 expected.

Based on a thorough analysis of RNDR's past data, the token's price in 2032 is projected to not fall below $138.06. It could reach as high as $168.11, with an average trading price of $142.17.

For 2033, the forecast predicts Render's price will not fall below $199.46. It could climb to as high as $240.29, with an average trading price of $206.56 expected.

According to the current Render Token price prediction from Coincodex, the price of Render Token is expected to rise by 230.66% and reach $15.08 by September 18, 2024. Coincodex's technical indicators suggest that the current market sentiment is Bearish, while the Fear & Greed Index indicates 28 (Fear). Render Token has experienced 10/30 (33%) green days with a price volatility of 16.60% over the last 30 days. According to the forecast, it is currently not advisable to purchase Render Token. Historical data and BTC halving cycles inform a 2025 low prediction for Render Token at $4.56, while its price could climb as high as $21.75 next year.

By 2026, market analysts and experts, referenced by Digital Coin Price, forecast that RENDER will initiate the year at $13.69 and hover around $16.32. This represents a substantial increase from the previous year.

The early stages of 2030, as analyzed by Render Price Prediction and technical analysis, suggest that RENDER's price will hit $33.67 at the year's start, maintaining the same level by year-end. Additionally, RENDER could peak at $31.41 within the same period. The span from 2024 to 2030 is expected to be significant for Render's growth.

RENDER has consistently ranked as a top product-oriented cryptocurrency. It holds leadership roles in several key areas -- DePIN, AI, and the metaverse -- which have drawn investor interest. In its niche of computer rendering, RENDER maintains almost unrivaled dominance.

This combination of factors has made RENDER a favorite among both institutional and retail investors. Barring any unforeseen, unlikely project-specific issues, RENDER's success depends largely on the broader crypto market's stability, including its most stable and popular assets. Supported by a robust business model, some analysts view RENDER as one of the best cryptocurrencies for long-term investment.

According to our predictions, it is advised to invest in the RENDER token at a price of $4 for a profitable return in the long term.

However, it's essential to remember that crypto projects are inherently volatile. Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.

Best Ethereum (ETH) Casinos and Gambling Sites | BitcoinChaser,https://bitcoinchaser.com/casino/crypto/ethereum/,2024-09-10,BitcoinChaser,"The Ethereum online casino industry is developing at an exponential rate and has started posing a serious threat to the bitcoin gambling industry. In many cases, cryptocurrency gambling sites have taken the opportunity to bridge the gap by offering Ethereum as a payment method for their most popular games. Ethereum gambling could well revolutionize the following aspects of the industry:

Later in the article, we'll get into more of the advantages of Ethereum gambling. First, it's a good idea to get to grips with what Ethereum actually means.

Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain is a publicly-viewed ledger containing all the transactions of its currency, in this case: Ether.

Ethereum was launched in 2015 and has since grown dramatically in both size and value.

What sets Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies is that its economy is based on smart contracts, onto which anybody can write any code. By allowing users to create and deploy smart contracts, control over transactions is totally democratized and accessible.

These smart contracts can be used for a wide range of purposes, including revolutionizing online gambling. In short, Ethereum gambling sites have all the advantages of Bitcoin online casinos, and more.

Included in our list of Ethereum casinos are:

This is the basic difference between Ethereum and Ether gambling. You can think of Ethereum as being about the gaming experience, and Ether as a potential currency of choice.

In other words, any Ethereum online casino could involve Ether gambling, but not all Ether gambling is based on Ethereum's smart contracts. In fact, Ethereum-based casinos may evolve to incorporate payment with other cryptocurrencies.

If you've read our article on crypto casinos, you'll know that gambling with currencies like Bitcoin has incomparable advantages for players. But what sets Ethereum apart from other Bitcoin casinos?

Transaction times on Ethereum are significantly shorter than on the Bitcoin network, which is a huge advantage. While Bitcoin casinos promise a transfer time of fewer than 10 minutes, Ethereum has a transfer time of an astonishing 16 seconds.

As a consequence, it is much cheaper to deposit and withdraw funds with Ethereum. In this way, smart contracts could potentially shift consumer behavior in the industry. Once players understand that an instant withdrawal can be coded into a contract, they are likely to demand it.

If you've played at cryptocurrency or Bitcoin casinos before, you've probably heard of Bitcoin games. Bitcoin games are special because they are based on the blockchain. Ethereum games are similar, but they have the added benefit of smart contracts.

It's almost impossible to come up with a complete list of Ethereum gambling possibilities because the network allows for an unprecedented degree of flexibility in terms of game programming through smart contracts.

Ethereum online casinos also make it possible for industry regulators to start playing a more proactive role. This takes a divergence from recent developments in the industry, which have seen more and more crypto casinos remaining unlicensed and unregulated. For example, authorities could actually offer best practices and advice on certain codes for every smart contract. In this way, regulation could become much easier and more individualized.

The Ethereum blockchain continuously re-invents and updates itself. The most recent Casper update, for instance, has introduced a Proof of Stake (PoS) system, which no longer requires all the nodes in the network to prove transactions. In other words, new developments in this fast-paced technology will keep making Ethereum gambling cheaper, faster, and smoother.

While there are plenty of casinos that have embraced Ethereum and/or Ether, there is also such a thing as a 'pure Ethereum casino'. These casinos offer games based on smart contracts and take payment in Ether. Clearly, the online casino industry is catching on to the diverse and innovative potential of Ethereum gambling.

In fact, one of the first pure Ethereum gambling initiatives, Edgeless, brought the 0% house edge model to online gambling. This is only one of the disruptive innovations that a pure Ethereum gambling initiative could come up with.

So, if Ethereum gambling has so many advantages, why isn't it more widespread? Smart contract casinos usually advertise using terms like 'fair' 'speed' and 'lower house edge'. While these are all convincing selling points, pretty much all online casinos use these buzzwords to advertise their site. As a consequence, the average online casino player might not notice anything special about Ethereum casinos.

For this reason, it's going to take 'organic education' and word-of-mouth for the market to really catch on to the advantages of smart contract Ethereum gambling. This is nothing unusual - even a technology as simple as email took a while to penetrate popular demand.

Maybe, in a couple of years, online casino players won't accept anything less than a casino with a smart contract in place.

Above, we've listed some of the most obvious advantages of Ethereum gambling, but it is not an exhaustive list. In fact, it's impossible to list all the ways that Ethereum could change the gambling scene because smart contracts enable infinite possibilities. The only limitation is your imagination. Why not be among the first to experience all the benefits of Ethereum online casinos?",https://bitcoinchaser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bitcoin-chaser.png,0.3725490196078431
BlockDAG TG Tap Miner -- Set to Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum,https://www.crypto-reporter.com/news/move-beyond-traditional-mining-blockdags-tg-tap-miner-simplifies-crypto-earnings-is-it-the-future-beyond-bitcoin-and-ethereum-75768/,2024-09-09,Crypto Reporter,"For a long time, Ethereum and Bitcoin have dominated the cryptocurrency landscape, yet emerging cryptos are now deserving of attention.

Buterin Calls for Open-Sourcing to Counter Tech Centralization,https://coinpaper.com/5213/buterin-calls-for-open-sourcing-to-counter-tech-centralization,2024-08-26,Coinpaper,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed concerns about the risks posed by centralization in various tech sectors, urging a broader focus on decentralized solutions beyond finance. Meanwhile, Tuur Demeester of Adamant Research has issued a cautionary note on Ethereum's market performance, predicting a potential decline in its value relative to Bitcoin.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has brought to light some of the most pressing technological threats facing society today. The Canadian programmer and influential voice in the blockchain space is expanding his advocacy for decentralization beyond the realm of finance, urging the tech community to consider the broader implications of centralized systems and the growing power of artificial intelligence.

Buterin has long been a proponent of decentralized finance (DeFi), a movement aimed at disrupting traditional financial systems through blockchain technology. However, in his recent post, he emphasized that the dangers of centralization extend far beyond finance. He singled out several areas where centralization poses significant risks, including identity systems, operating systems, and algorithmic governance.

One of the most striking points in Buterin's post was his discussion of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), a technology that is still in its early stages but holds immense potential -- and risk. Researchers have recently developed a non-invasive BCI that can decode language from the brain by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology with artificial intelligence. While this technology is still years away from commercial availability, Buterin has already raised alarms about its implications for privacy.

Buterin, who describes himself as ""super pro-BCI,"" is enthusiastic about the potential benefits of brain-computer interfaces. However, he cautioned that there is a significant risk if these interfaces are controlled by proprietary, centralized entities. A proprietary BCI with backdoors, he warned, could effectively eliminate the privacy of the mind -- a chilling prospect in a world where mental privacy is one of the last bastions of personal freedom.

To counter this threat, Buterin advocates for open-sourcing BCI technology. By ensuring that the development and deployment of BCIs are open and transparent, the risks associated with centralization and proprietary control can be mitigated. This approach would allow for greater scrutiny and collaboration, reducing the likelihood of backdoors and other privacy-compromising features.

While Buterin acknowledges the importance of decentralized finance in addressing some of these challenges, he is adamant that it is not enough on its own. He argues that even with ""perfect"" decentralized finance, the world would still ""really really suck"" if the broader threats posed by centralization are not addressed.

One of the key areas where Buterin sees potential is in the intersection of decentralized finance and other decentralized technologies. He cites privacy-preserving methods of paying for services like VPNs as an example of how decentralized finance can be used to protect privacy and autonomy in a world increasingly dominated by centralized entities.

Buterin's vision is one of a future where decentralized technologies work together to create a more open, transparent, and secure digital landscape. By addressing the broader threats posed by centralization, Buterin believes that the full potential of decentralized finance -- and decentralized technology more broadly -- can be realized.

In related news, Tuur Demeester, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space and founder of Adamant Research, has recently issued a stark warning about the future of Ethereum (ETH). Demeester's analysis points to a significant decline in the value of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that the ETH/BTC trading pair could drop to as low as 0.03 BTC in the near future. This forecast has raised concerns among investors and market watchers, particularly given Ethereum's recent performance and the broader market conditions.

As of the latest data from Binance, the ETH/BTC pair is currently trading at approximately 0.043 BTC. This comes after a tumultuous period in the cryptocurrency markets, where Ethereum failed to mount a significant rally despite the launch of spot-based Ether ETFs in the United States by financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The introduction of these ETFs was expected to provide a substantial boost to Ethereum's price, but the market reaction has been muted.

Earlier in the month, the ETH/BTC pair plummeted to as low as 0.04 BTC during a widespread global stock market crash, which also heavily impacted leading cryptocurrencies. In typical fashion, altcoins like Ethereum suffered more significant losses compared to Bitcoin during this risk-off environment, a pattern that has become familiar to seasoned traders.

While the ETH/BTC pair has since recovered by approximately 15% from its recent lows, it remains 15% below its 2024 peak of 0.061 BTC, which was achieved in January. This continued underperformance has led to growing concerns about the long-term viability of Ethereum as the leading altcoin, particularly in the context of the ongoing ""flippening"" debate.

The concept of the ""flippening"" -- where Ethereum would surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization -- has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community since Ethereum's inception. The narrative gained significant traction in 2017, a year that saw the Ethereum network experience explosive growth due to the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs). At its peak in June 2017, the ETH/BTC ratio reached a historic high of 0.15 BTC, fueling speculation that Ethereum could eventually overtake Bitcoin.

However, this optimism was short-lived. By the end of 2017, Ethereum had lost 80% of its value against Bitcoin, a dramatic reversal that highlighted the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency markets. The ETH/BTC pair briefly surged back to 0.12 BTC in January 2018, right before the onset of a major bear market that affected the entire crypto space.

Ethereum's fortunes have ebbed and flowed since then. The network saw another revival in 2021, driven by the burgeoning non-fungible token (NFT) market and the increasing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Yet, despite these developments, the ETH/BTC pair only managed to peak at 0.087 BTC in December 2021, far below its previous highs.

The current downturn in the ETH/BTC ratio has reignited debates about Ethereum's future prospects. Demeester's warning of a potential drop to 0.03 BTC signals a bearish outlook that contrasts sharply with more optimistic predictions from other industry figures.

Nick Tomaino, CEO of crypto investment firm 1confirmation, remains bullish on Ethereum's long-term potential. Tomaino recently suggested that Ethereum could eventually surpass Bitcoin in market cap, arguing that Ethereum's impact on the broader crypto ecosystem has yet to be fully appreciated. According to Tomaino, the combination of Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, its role in DeFi, and its integral position in the NFT market could drive a significant revaluation of ETH in the coming years.

However, this optimistic view is not without its challenges. The continued dominance of Bitcoin, particularly during periods of market instability, shines the spotlight on the difficulties Ethereum faces in closing the gap. Bitcoin's status as the ""digital gold"" of the cryptocurrency world gives it a level of resilience that other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, have struggled to match.

The potential decline of the ETH/BTC pair to 0.03 BTC, as forecasted by Demeester, would represent a significant setback for Ethereum. Such a drop would likely exacerbate fears of a prolonged bear market for the altcoin, potentially leading to a shift in investor sentiment away from ETH and towards more stable assets like Bitcoin.

This scenario could also have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. A sharp decline in Ethereum's value could trigger a sell-off in other altcoins, many of which are closely correlated with ETH. Additionally, the failure of Ethereum to capitalize on major events like the launch of spot-based Ether ETFs could raise questions about the network's ability to sustain its growth trajectory in the face of competition from other blockchain platforms.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1724644929/cp6225_a_community_of_programmers_e8e693e4_9f83_4e57_9766_6a4c3e147c88_c1413fea2f.webp,-0.03529411764705881

"Crypto Glossary: HODL, Bear, Bullish, and more",https://usa.inquirer.net/155728/crypto-glossary-hodl-bear-bullish-and-more,2024-08-27,INQUIRER.net USA,"Disclaimer: This article is intended for US audiences.

Navigating the world of cryptocurrencies can be overwhelming, especially with the unique terminology that has developed over time. Many of these terms originate from English, making them challenging for some newcomers to understand. Below is a comprehensive glossary of essential crypto terms that every investor should know in 2024.

HODL

The term ""HODL"" stands for ""Hold On for Dear Life."" It refers to the strategy of holding onto your cryptocurrency assets over the long term, regardless of market volatility. The term originated from a misspelled word in a 2013 BitcoinTalk forum post by a user named ""GameKyuubi."" This typo quickly gained popularity and became a staple in crypto slang.

Bear Market

A bear market occurs when the market experiences a prolonged decline, typically defined as a drop of 20% or more. During this phase, sellers dominate, and the market tends to be characterized by fear and pessimism. Bear markets can last for years, leading to significant losses for unprepared investors.

Bull Market

Conversely, a bull market is marked by rising prices and increasing investor confidence. Often linked to the Bitcoin halving cycle, a bull market can result in gains of 20% or more over a period of months. The optimism during a bull market often attracts media attention and new investors to the crypto space.

Altcoin Season

Altcoin season is a period when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin. This phase occurs as liquidity flows from Bitcoin into smaller-cap coins, driving their prices higher. Altcoin seasons have been crucial for the growth of the broader blockchain ecosystem, allowing projects to flourish and gain traction.

FUD

""FUD"" stands for ""Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt."" It describes a tactic used to spread negative sentiment about a particular cryptocurrency, often to drive down its price. The term originated outside the crypto industry but has become widely used due to the market's volatile nature.

FOMO

""FOMO,"" or ""Fear of Missing Out,"" is the anxiety that arises when an investor feels pressured to buy into a rapidly appreciating asset. The term gained popularity with the rise of social media and has become a common phenomenon among cryptocurrency traders.

DYOR

""DYOR,"" meaning ""Do Your Own Research,"" is a crucial principle in the crypto world. It emphasizes the importance of conducting personal research before making any investment decisions. This term was popularized on forums like BitcoinTalk and Reddit and is a key guideline for both new and experienced investors.

Web3

Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, where users have ownership over their data and digital content. Unlike Web2, where large corporations control most online interactions, Web3 is decentralized, giving individuals more control. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood first introduced the concept in 2014.

Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It enables secure, transparent, and anonymous transactions without the need for intermediaries. The first blockchain was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 with the launch of Bitcoin.

ATH

""ATH"" stands for ""All-Time High,"" referring to the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever reached. It is a significant metric for traders, indicating peak market conditions. For instance, Bitcoin's ATH was $73,737.94 in May 2024.

Buy the Dip

The phrase ""Buy the Dip"" refers to purchasing assets during a market correction or after a significant price drop. This strategy, popularized on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram, is often seen as an opportunity to buy undervalued assets at a discount.

Rug Pull

A ""Rug Pull"" is a type of scam where developers abandon a project after attracting substantial investment, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This scam is particularly prevalent in the DeFi space, where anyone can create and promote a new token.

KYC

""KYC,"" or ""Know Your Customer,"" is a regulatory process that requires financial institutions to verify the identity of their clients. Although it goes against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies, KYC is mandatory for many centralized exchanges to comply with government regulations.

Ape

In crypto slang, to ""Ape"" into a project means to invest impulsively without thorough research. The term reflects the instinctual behavior of apes and is often associated with high-risk investments in meme coins.

Whale

A ""Whale"" is an individual or entity holding a large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to influence market prices. This term has been used in traditional finance for decades to describe large investors who can sway market trends.

"The Most Pivotal Moments in Digital Assets, Blockchain and Web3 - Tekedia",https://www.tekedia.com/the-most-pivotal-moments-in-digital-assets-blockchain-and-web3/,2024-08-30,Tekedia,"The digital landscape has undergone a significant transformation over the past few years, with digital assets, blockchain technology, and the emergence of Web3 redefining the boundaries of what's possible in the virtual world. This blog post will explore some of the most pivotal moments that have shaped the trajectory of these technologies and what they mean for the future.

Digital assets, particularly cryptocurrencies, have seen an explosive increase in both value and public awareness. Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, was just the beginning. The subsequent introduction of Ethereum brought smart contracts into the mix, enabling more complex transactions and decentralized applications (dApps). These innovations laid the groundwork for a new digital economy, one where digital assets could be as influential as traditional fiat currencies.

Blockchain technology, the underlying structure for cryptocurrencies, has proven to be much more than just a ledger for transactions. Its potential for creating secure, transparent, and immutable records has been recognized across various industries. From supply chain management to voting systems, blockchain is paving the way for a more accountable and efficient way of doing business.

Web3 represents the next phase of the internet's evolution, where decentralized networks take center stage, and users regain control over their data. The concept of a decentralized web has been bolstered by the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have introduced new ways for creators to monetize their work and for investors to participate in the digital economy.

One of the primary barriers to widespread adoption of Web3 is the technical complexity inherent in blockchain technology. For many users, the learning curve is steep, and the user experience (UX) can be less than intuitive. Simplifying this experience is crucial for mass adoption.

As the number of users and transactions on blockchain networks grows, scalability becomes a significant concern. Current blockchain solutions can struggle with limited transaction speeds and high fees, which can deter businesses and users from engaging with Web3 platforms. The vision of a fully integrated Web3 ecosystem is hindered by the current lack of interoperability between different blockchain platforms. Achieving seamless interaction between these platforms is essential for the realization of a truly decentralized web.

Despite the robust security features of blockchain, Web3 is not immune to cyber threats. Issues such as 51% attacks, smart contract vulnerabilities, and other exploits remain a concern for developers and users alike. The regulatory landscape for digital assets and blockchain technology is still in flux. Calls for clearer guidelines and consumer protections are growing louder as the technology becomes more mainstream. This uncertainty can hinder investment and innovation in the space.

As we look ahead, several milestones and trends are shaping the future of Web3 and blockchain. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, recently surpassed 200 million users, a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are gaining traction, offering a new level of privacy and security for online transactions. In the gaming sector, blockchain technology is creating new opportunities for players to own in-game assets and partake in decentralized economies.

The journey of digital assets, blockchain, and Web3 is far from over. With each passing day, new developments emerge, and the potential for these technologies to revolutionize our digital interactions grows. As we continue to witness the growth and adoption of these innovations, it's clear that they will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the digital world.",https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21171949/web3.jpg,0.3019607843137255
Wallet e criptovalute: quali sono i migliori e le differenze,https://www.tomshw.it/altro/wallet-e-criptovalute-quali-sono-i-migliori-e-le-differenze,2024-08-26,Tom's Hardware,"Custodire con sicurezza le proprie criptovalute è un aspetto importante da non lasciare troppo al caso; in rete sono disponibili numerosi prodotti, ma quali sono i migliori?

Le criptovalute rappresentano una rivoluzione nel mondo delle transazioni finanziarie, proponendosi come un'alternativa decentralizzata e sicura alle valute tradizionali. Nate con l'avvento del Bitcoin nel 2009, le criptovalute si basano su tecnologie di crittografia avanzata per garantire transazioni sicure, trasparenti e prive di intermediari centralizzati come banche o governi.

Una delle caratteristiche fondamentali delle criptovalute è la loro natura digitale. A differenza del denaro contante, che può essere fisicamente custodito in un portafoglio, le criptovalute esistono unicamente in forma elettronica. Questo ha portato allo sviluppo di strumenti specifici per la loro gestione e custodia: i wallet digitali. Analogamente ai portafogli tradizionali, i wallet per criptovalute servono a conservare, gestire e utilizzare queste monete digitali.

Un wallet per criptovalute è un software o un dispositivo hardware che consente agli utenti di gestire le loro criptovalute in modo sicuro. Nonostante il termine ""portafoglio"" possa far pensare a una custodia fisica delle monete digitali, in realtà un wallet conserva le chiavi private necessarie per accedere alle criptovalute registrate sulla blockchain.

I wallet per criptovalute si dividono in tre principali categorie: hot wallet, cold wallet e paper wallet, ciascuna con caratteristiche e utilizzi specifici.

Con hot wallet si intendono dei portafogli digitali collegati a Internet e sono utilizzati principalmente per le transazioni frequenti. Possono essere applicazioni installate su dispositivi mobili, desktop, o piattaforme web. La loro principale caratteristica è la facilità d'uso e l'accessibilità immediata.

Tuttavia, questa connessione continua alla rete li rende più vulnerabili agli attacchi informatici. Sono ideali per chi ha bisogno di accedere rapidamente ai propri fondi per effettuare pagamenti o scambi, ma è fondamentale adottare misure di sicurezza come l'autenticazione a due fattori per proteggere i propri asset.

Al contrario, i cold wallet sono portafogli non connessi a Internet, rendendoli intrinsecamente più sicuri rispetto agli hot wallet. Essi possono essere dispositivi hardware specifici o software installati su dispositivi che non sono mai connessi a Internet.

Grazie alla loro natura offline, sono praticamente immuni agli attacchi online, rendendoli la scelta ideale per lo stoccaggio a lungo termine di grandi quantità di criptovalute. L'uso di cold wallet richiede però una maggiore attenzione alla conservazione fisica del dispositivo o dei dati di accesso, poiché la perdita di questi può significare la perdita definitiva dei fondi.

Infine, i paper wallet rappresentano una forma di cold storage ancora più semplice e tangibile. Consistono in un documento fisico, solitamente un foglio di carta, su cui sono stampate le chiavi pubbliche e private necessarie per accedere alle criptovalute. Spesso includono codici QR per facilitare le transazioni. Non essendo digitali, sono completamente al di fuori della portata degli hacker, ma presentano rischi significativi legati alla loro vulnerabilità fisica.

Un paper wallet può essere distrutto, perso o deteriorato; quindi, è cruciale conservarlo in un luogo sicuro e resistente nel tempo. Nonostante queste limitazioni, i paper wallet sono una soluzione economica e altamente sicura per conservare criptovalute, specialmente per chi non ha bisogno di accedere frequentemente ai propri fondi.

Per stabilire i migliori wallet in base alle funzionalità e ai vantaggi offerti, ogni esemplare è stato valutato seguendo gli aspetti cardine riportati di seguito.

Le stablecoin più diffuse supportate includono Tether (USDT), Circolar (USDC), Euro (EUR) e Dai, con una particolare attenzione a queste monete. Inoltre, si tiene conto della disponibilità delle principali criptovalute per capitalizzazione di mercato o funzionalità.

L'approccio alla valutazione dell'usabilità differisce tra hot wallet e cold wallet, ma per entrambe le categorie si considerano fattori come l'integrazione con gli exchange e l'accessibilità allo staking. Anche la capacità di convertire monete all'interno del portafoglio rientra in questa metrica.

I costi e le commissioni variano in base al tipo di wallet. Per gli hot wallet, ci sono commissioni per il trasferimento di token dentro e fuori il wallet, costi di conversione e costi di transazione. Per i cold wallet, invece, bisogna considerare la spesa iniziale per l'acquisto di un dispositivo di archiviazione hardware.

I tipi di assistenza clienti disponibili includono telefono, email, live chat e supporto 24/7. Al netto dell'assistenza, ricordiamo che nessuno è in grado di accedere al vostro wallet / sottrarvi fondi (se non tramite un attacco malevolo).

Tra le funzionalità aggiuntive valutate ci sono la disponibilità di risorse educative, grafici live, supporto per i token non fungibili (NFT), accedere alle DAO e avviare app.

Coinbase Wallet è un portafoglio di criptovalute decentralizzato e un'applicazione per il Web3 sviluppata da Coinbase. Coinbase Wallet è un'app non custodiale, il che significa che gli utenti hanno il controllo completo delle loro chiavi private e dei loro fondi.
