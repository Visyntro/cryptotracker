Top Crypto Exchanges in 2024: Guide,https://u.today/guides/top-crypto-exchanges-in-2024-guide,2024-08-27,u.today,"Despite the market sending mixed signals for crypto traders, it is safe to say that volatility is back on the market. As such, this is the right moment to check out the best crypto exchanges for trading -- a cornerstone element of the global crypto ecosystem.

In this guide, we are going to indicate the most popular crypto exchanges and share some tips on how to choose the best crypto platform in 2024.

In 2024, there are a plethora of cryptocurrency exchanges available for traders with different backgrounds, deposit sizes, trading styles and so on.

As of 2024, Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken are typically listed among the top cryptocurrency exchanges.

Based on a variety of parameters, there is a list of the best cryptocurrency exchanges for trading and liquidity management (in no particular order):

In the following guide, we are going to focus on their specifications, pros and cons and the opportunities these platforms unlock.

A cryptocurrency exchange (crypto exchange, crypto trading platform) is an online service where users can buy and sell various digital assets (cryptocurrencies). These exchanges operate not unlike stocks, index, or ForEx markets but deal exclusively in digital currencies.

Exchanges typically offer various tools for market analysis, trading and secure storage of assets. In practice, crypto exchanges are often used as crypto wallets for only storing, receiving and transferring cryptocurrency with no conversion operations.

They play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing trading opportunities, enabling price discovery and facilitating the broader adoption of digital currencies among new generations of internet users.

As per the CoinMarketCap tracker, there are thousands of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in 2024. Due to this fact, choosing the right one might be challenging for newcomers.

As such, the platform should be secure, user-friendly, multi-product, and has to demonstrate stellar reputation in order to become part of the top crypto exchanges list.

Here is the simplest classification of cryptocurrency exchanges you need to find the one that suits you best:

On decentralized crypto exchanges, you are the one responsible for the keys from your account, while centralized platforms manage the keypairs themselves: You just log in via familiar tools.

Some exchanges only work with tokens issued on one blockchain, i.e., Bitcoin or Ethereum (for ERC-20 tokens), while the rest of crypto services work with a variety of blockchains.

Then, some exchanges accept fiat currencies from cards and bank accounts, while others only work with crypto: To top up your account, you already need to get some crypto from a third-party platform.

The vast majority of the largest crypto exchanges in the cryptocurrency world are centralized, many-blockchain, crypto-to-fiat platforms.

Now we are ready to proceed to the guide of the most popular crypto exchanges in 2024. The overview will focus on history, specifications and the main opportunities offered by the platforms.

Ethereum Wallet Growth Hits 2024 Low Amid Spot ETH ETF Launch,https://coinpaper.com/5035/ethereum-wallet-growth-hits-2024-low-amid-spot-eth-etf-launch,2024-08-05,Coinpaper,"Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino Rejects Ethereum Allocation in Favor of Bitcoin

Celestia, a layer-1 data availability network, is rapidly gaining market share in onchain data storage, challenging Ethereum's dominance. Concurrently, the number of new Ethereum wallet addresses has reached its lowest level this year, influenced by the launch of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. market. Meanwhile, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has reiterated his preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum for the company's reserve allocations, emphasizing Bitcoin's immutability and limited supply.

The Ethereum network has hit a significant milestone, though not in the direction many investors would hope for. The number of new Ethereum wallet addresses has reached its lowest level this year. This decline follows the recent launch of spot ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on the U.S. stock market, suggesting a shift in how investors are gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency.

According to on-chain data, the seven-day moving average of new Ethereum wallets has plummeted to its lowest point since December 2023. While this figure remains above much of the 2023 average, it marks a notable downturn in new user engagement on the Ethereum network. This decrease isn't confined to new wallets alone; the average number of active Ethereum addresses and transactions have also seen declines, both hitting nearly six-month lows.

The correlation between the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs and the decline in new wallet addresses raises intriguing questions about investor behavior. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a regulated, accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to the leading altcoin without the complexities of managing digital wallets and navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. The convenience and security of these financial products might be diverting potential new Ethereum users away from direct token purchases.

While Ethereum grapples with declining new addresses, its rival Solana is experiencing a contrasting trend. Solana has seen an uptick in new addresses, driven by the rapid growth of its decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. Solana's network, known for its high-speed transactions and lower fees, is becoming an attractive alternative for users, particularly with the continued interest in memecoins.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is also witnessing an increase in new addresses, despite the broader market downturn. However, this growth in wallet numbers hasn't translated into higher fees or significantly increased on-chain activity, indicating that the new wallets might not be contributing much to transaction volumes or network utility.

The launch of spot ETH ETFs marks a significant development in the cryptocurrency market, providing a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. For Ethereum, this could mean a shift in how it measures growth and engagement. While new wallet addresses and on-chain activity have historically been key indicators of network health, the introduction of ETFs suggests that off-chain financial products could play an increasingly important role.

For investors, the emergence of Ethereum ETFs offers a new avenue for exposure, potentially reducing the necessity for direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. This shift might lead to a more mature market where institutional investment tools complement traditional on-chain participation.

However, the competition from networks like Solana and the evolving dynamics of the Bitcoin network suggest that Ethereum must continue to innovate and address user needs to maintain its position in the market. Enhancements in scalability, transaction speed, and cost-efficiency will be crucial in attracting and retaining users who might otherwise be swayed by newer, faster networks or convenient financial products like ETFs.

Celestia, a layer-1 data availability network, is rapidly approaching a pivotal milestone in the blockchain industry. According to Blockworks Research, Celestia is on track to surpass Ethereum as the leading network for onchain data storage. Since May, Celestia has been steadily increasing its market share from around 20% to approximately 40% by July 31, indicating a significant shift in the data availability landscape.

Launched in 2023, Celestia has positioned itself as a modular data availability network designed to facilitate the secure launch of individual blockchains. This emphasis on data availability places Celestia in direct competition with Ethereum, the current leader in Web3 settlement layers. The growth trajectory of Celestia demonstrates its potential to reshape the competitive dynamics within the blockchain sector.

Celestia's modular architecture offers several advantages, particularly in terms of cost-efficiency and scalability. As the network continues to gain traction, its appeal to developers and enterprises seeking efficient data storage solutions becomes more apparent.

In March, Ethereum introduced the Dencun upgrade, which included ""blobs,"" temporary offchain data stores aimed at reducing costs for layer-2 scaling networks such as Arbitrum and Base. These blobs are stored on Beacon Chain nodes for approximately two weeks, allowing validators sufficient time to confirm data accuracy and post attestations on the mainnet. This method provides significant cost savings, which Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin expects to surpass 98%.

Despite these innovations, Ethereum's transaction fees often remain higher due to the complexity of smart contract interactions. A report by staking platform Figment highlights that while Ethereum's fees can be reduced through Dencun's upgrades, Celestia's modular architecture generally offers even lower fees. The efficient design of Celestia supports high throughput and reduces congestion, making it an attractive option for data storage.

Celestia is not alone in challenging Ethereum's dominance in data availability. Other notable contenders include EigenLayer and Avail. EigenLayer, which launched its restaking protocol EigenDA in April, and Avail, a data availability protocol spun off from Polygon in July, are both vying for a share of the market. These emerging solutions further intensify the competition and drive innovation in the data availability space.

According to Dan Smith, Blockworks' data analytics manager, even as rivals like Celestia gain ground in data storage, Ethereum is likely to retain its position as Web3's premier settlement layer. ""Ethereum remains dominant in decentralization, stables, and total value locked (TVL), which is what a settlement layer needs,"" Smith stated in a post on X.

The blockchain industry is witnessing a transformative phase, with Celestia's rise challenging Ethereum's longstanding supremacy. As Celestia continues to grow its market share, it will be crucial to observe how Ethereum adapts and evolves in response to this new competition. The advancements in data availability solutions by Celestia, EigenLayer, and Avail are poised to drive further innovation and efficiency within the blockchain ecosystem, ultimately benefiting developers, enterprises, and end-users alike.

In a recent social media post, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has made it clear that the company will not be allocating any portion of its profits to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Instead, Ardoino reaffirmed his preference for Bitcoin, citing its immutability and fixed supply as key reasons for this decision.

""Bitcoin is immutable. Only 21 million coins. Easy choice,"" Ardoino stated, emphasizing the unique characteristics that make Bitcoin an attractive asset. This sentiment is consistent with Tether's strategy announced last May, where the leading stablecoin issuer revealed plans to allocate 15% of its profits toward purchasing Bitcoin. The objective behind this move was to fortify and diversify Tether's reserves, leveraging Bitcoin's reputation as a ""long-term store of value with substantial growth potential.""

Tether's most recent quarterly report highlighted a record-breaking net profit of $1.3 billion. Despite this impressive figure, the company's Bitcoin reserves have remained unchanged. Ardoino later clarified that Tether's investment arm did indeed purchase Bitcoin in 2024, ensuring the company's commitment to its previously stated strategy.

This is not the first instance where Ardoino has voiced his criticism of Ethereum. Following the much-anticipated Merge upgrade in 2022, Ardoino expressed skepticism about Ethereum's capability to rival Bitcoin, accusing the blockchain of frequently shifting its narratives. His latest comments continue this critical stance, particularly in light of Ethereum's recent performance.

In his post, Ardoino pointed to Ethereum's declining performance against Bitcoin over the past few years. The ETH/BTC pair has dropped 45% since peaking at 0.088 in December 2021. This decline brings attention to the challenges Ethereum faces in maintaining its position relative to Bitcoin.

In May, Ethereum experienced a significant price spike following the unexpected approval of various spot ETFs. However, this surge was short-lived as the flagship altcoin struggled to sustain its momentum. The future price action of Ethereum now heavily depends on the volume of inflows it receives. So far, these financial products have had a lukewarm reception, largely due to outflows recorded by Grayscale's product.

Ardoino's remarks also highlight the broader market dynamics and the contrasting fortunes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin continues to be seen as a secure, long-term investment with limited supply, Ethereum's evolving technology and frequent updates appear to add a layer of uncertainty, affecting investor confidence.

Tether's decision to prioritize Bitcoin over Ethereum for its reserve holdings signals a strategic focus on stability and long-term value preservation. By investing in Bitcoin, Tether aims to leverage the cryptocurrency's established reputation and intrinsic value properties. This move may also reflect a cautious approach toward assets that are perceived as having higher volatility or less predictable development trajectories.

As the leading stablecoin issuer, Tether's investment choices are closely watched by the market and can influence broader investor sentiment. The company's robust profit generation and strategic allocations are critical for maintaining confidence in its stablecoin, USDT, which is widely used across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",https://res.coinpaper.com/coinpaper/image/upload/v1722833885/cp6225_ethereum_wallet_e732fcef_ab85_44be_ba8d_7440b05d8cac_cd12d38262.webp,0.1137254901960785

Definition of Altcoins and Their Distinction from Bitcoin

Altcoins (short for 'alternative coins') refer to any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most widely recognised and valued, altcoins have emerged as alternatives with different purposes, functionalities, and technologies. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange, altcoins often aim to improve upon Bitcoin's limitations or offer entirely new features. For instance, Ethereum, the most prominent altcoin, introduced smart contracts that allow for decentralised applications, while others, like Litecoin, focus on faster transaction speeds.

Overview of the Current Altcoin Market

The market for altcoins has grown exponentially since the early days of cryptocurrency. Today, there are thousands of altcoins, each with unique use cases and technological innovations. The market capitalisation of altcoins has increased significantly, accounting for a substantial portion of the overall cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, the combined market cap of altcoins has been steadily rising, driven by the increasing adoption of decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain-based solutions across various industries. However, the altcoin market remains highly volatile, influenced by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment.

Importance of Altcoins for Global and Local Economies

Altcoins play a crucial role in both global and local economies. On a global scale, they contribute to the diversification of the cryptocurrency market, offering investors and users a broader range of options beyond Bitcoin. Altcoins have also been at the forefront of technological innovation, driving the development of decentralised applications, smart contracts, and blockchain solutions that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries. Locally, altcoins can empower emerging markets by providing access to financial services, enabling cross-border transactions, and fostering economic inclusion. In countries with unstable currencies or limited access to banking, altcoins can offer alternative financial systems, thus enhancing economic resilience and promoting growth.

Altcoins by Region

1.1. Americas

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum, developed in the United States, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and the most significant altcoin in terms of impact and innovation. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just a digital currency, it is a decentralised platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). Its introduction of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with Ethereum 2.0 have solidified its position as a leading technology in the blockchain space. The prospects for Ethereum are promising, especially as the demand for decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continues to grow.

Solana (SOL)

Solana is another prominent altcoin originating from the Americas, particularly from the United States. It is known for its high-performance blockchain, which supports thousands of transactions per second at low costs. Solana's innovative proof-of-history consensus mechanism sets it apart, making it a strong contender in the race to scale blockchain technology. As more developers and projects migrate to Solana due to its speed and efficiency, its potential for growth in the coming years is substantial.

1.2. Europe

Cardano (ADA)

Cardano, developed by a team of engineers and academics in Europe, is a blockchain platform designed for sustainability, scalability, and interoperability. Unlike many other altcoins, Cardano's development is based on peer-reviewed research and a formal development model. Cardano aims to create a more secure and scalable blockchain network, particularly for decentralised finance applications. With its unique Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and focus on real-world applications, Cardano has the potential to play a significant role in the future of blockchain technology in Europe and beyond.

IOTA (MIOTA)

IOTA, another significant European altcoin, is designed to facilitate transactions between devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Unlike traditional blockchains, IOTA uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure called the Tangle, which allows for feeless transactions and infinite scalability. Supported by the European Union, IOTA is being integrated into various smart city projects and industrial applications across the continent. The growth of IoT and smart infrastructure in Europe bodes well for IOTA's future adoption and success.

1.3. Asia

Binance Coin (BNB)

Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the most prominent altcoins in Asia, originating from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which was initially founded in China before relocating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. BNB was initially created as a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, but its use has expanded significantly. BNB is now integral to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralised applications. BSC has gained popularity due to its low transaction fees and faster processing times compared to Ethereum, making BNB a central player in the Asian and global crypto markets. The widespread adoption of Binance's ecosystem across Asia positions BNB as a key altcoin with strong growth potential.

NEO

Often referred to as the 'Chinese Ethereum', NEO is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency enabling digital assets and smart contracts development. NEO was developed in China and is designed to digitise various assets using smart contracts, focusing on regulatory compliance and a digital identity system. NEO's dual-token system, featuring NEO and GAS tokens, allows for the smooth operation of the network and provides incentives for developers and users. Despite strict cryptocurrency regulations in China, NEO has managed to maintain relevance, especially in projects that require a combination of blockchain technology and regulatory oversight. With China's growing interest in adopting blockchain technology for its digital economy, NEO is well-positioned to play a significant role in the region's blockchain development.

Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is an Indian-origin blockchain platform that addresses some of Ethereum's major scalability issues. By providing a Layer 2 scaling solution, Polygon enhances transaction speed and reduces fees on the Ethereum network. With the growing interest in decentralised finance and the increasing number of dApps being built on the Ethereum platform, Polygon's importance and adoption are likely to grow. Its strong foundation in India, a country with a burgeoning tech industry, positions Polygon as a critical player in the global altcoin market.

Vexanium (VEX)

Vexanium is a blockchain platform from Indonesia designed to support decentralised applications (dApps) and digital marketing solutions. It aims to provide an accessible blockchain platform for businesses and developers in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. Vexanium's focus on local businesses and its adaptability to regional markets give it a unique edge in the Asian altcoin landscape. As blockchain adoption increases in Southeast Asia, Vexanium has the potential to grow significantly within this emerging market.

2.1. Technological Innovations

Impact of DeFi and NFTs on Altcoin Development

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have been among the most significant drivers of technological innovation in the altcoin space. DeFi platforms allow users to access financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries, using smart contracts on blockchain networks. Altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon have become central to the DeFi ecosystem due to their ability to support these decentralized applications (dApps). The growth of DeFi has also led to the creation of numerous specialized altcoins that cater specifically to this market, offering unique features and governance models.

Similarly, NFTs have opened new avenues for digital ownership and creativity, with altcoins like Ethereum and Binance Coin playing crucial roles in the minting and trading of NFTs. The rise of NFTs has also sparked the development of new blockchain networks optimized for these tokens, further diversifying the altcoin market. As DeFi and NFT adoption continue to expand, altcoins that support or innovate within these sectors are likely to see increased demand and development.

Advancement of Smart Contracts and Network Scalability

Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, have revolutionized the way transactions and agreements are handled on blockchain networks. Ethereum pioneered this technology, but many other altcoins have since built upon and improved it. For example, Cardano's use of a formal development model and peer-reviewed research in the implementation of smart contracts aims to enhance security and scalability.

Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges for blockchain networks, and various altcoins are addressing this in different ways. Solana's proof-of-history consensus mechanism allows it to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains available. Similarly, Polygon's Layer 2 solution helps alleviate congestion on the Ethereum network by handling transactions off-chain, significantly reducing fees and improving transaction speed. These innovations in smart contracts and scalability are critical for the continued growth and adoption of altcoins.

2.2. Regulatory Issues

Variations in Cryptocurrency Regulations Across Countries

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies significantly from one country to another, impacting the development and adoption of altcoins. In the United States, regulatory bodies like the SEC have been scrutinising cryptocurrencies with a focus on ensuring compliance with securities laws. While this regulatory uncertainty can create challenges for altcoins operating within the U.S., it also pushes developers to create more robust and compliant systems.

In Europe, regulations are generally more liberal, with the European Union working on frameworks like the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation to provide clarity and support for the growth of digital assets. Altcoins in Europe, such as IOTA and Cardano, benefit from this relatively favourable regulatory environment, which encourages innovation while protecting investors.

Asia presents a mixed regulatory landscape. Some countries, like China, have imposed strict regulations, including outright bans on cryptocurrency trading, which pose challenges for NEO and other Chinese altcoins. However, other countries in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, have adopted more crypto-friendly regulations, allowing for the development and growth of local altcoins. India's regulatory stance is rapidly evolving via ongoing discussions about regulating cryptocurrencies, which will significantly impact the future of Indian altcoins like Polygon.

Impact of Regulations on Altcoin Development and Adoption

Regulations play a pivotal role in adopting and developing altcoins. Strict regulations can hinder the growth of altcoins by limiting their accessibility and use cases. Conversely, clear and supportive regulations can foster innovation and encourage the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. For instance, the positive regulatory environment in countries like Switzerland has made it a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation, attracting projects from around the world.

In contrast, ambiguous or hostile regulations can stifle innovation and drive projects to relocate to more favourable jurisdictions. The regulatory environment also affects investor confidence, with clear regulations providing a sense of security and encouraging institutional investment in altcoins. As global regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the adaptability of altcoins to these changes will be crucial to their long-term success.

2.3. Economic Factors

Impact of Economic Unrest on Altcoins' Appeal

Economic instability, such as inflation, currency devaluation, and financial crises, often drives interest in cryptocurrencies, including altcoins. In countries experiencing hyperinflation or a lack of trust in the local currency, citizens may turn to altcoins as a store of value or a means of conducting transactions. For example, in Venezuela, where inflation has reached extreme levels, altcoins like Dash have gained popularity as alternatives to the national currency.

Similarly, in countries with unstable political or economic environments, altcoins can provide a hedge against local economic conditions. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies allows users to bypass traditional financial systems, offering a level of financial autonomy that is particularly appealing in times of economic uncertainty.

Role of Altcoins in the Development of Digital Economies

Altcoins are increasingly playing a crucial role in developing digital economies, particularly in emerging markets. By offering alternatives to traditional financial systems, altcoins can foster financial inclusion, especially in regions with limited access to banking services. Altcoins also enable the creation of new economic models, such as token economies, where users can earn, trade, and spend tokens within specific ecosystems.

According to Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa Broker, 'As digital economies continue to expand, the role of altcoins in these ecosystems is likely to increase, offering new opportunities for economic growth and innovation.'

Before diving into the world of crypto dice casino sites, it's important to grasp the basics of cryptocurrency. Simply put, cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for secure financial transactions.

Unlike traditional currency, it operates independently of a central bank and is decentralized. This offers benefits such as low transaction fees and faster processing times.

The Basics of Cryptocurrency

In order to use cryptocurrency on casino sites, it is essential to understand how it works. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets, which can be either software-based or hardware-based.

Wallets provide the necessary encryption tools to secure transactions and store cryptocurrency securely. Popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, offer different features and levels of security.

By familiarizing yourself with the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, you'll be better equipped to make informed decisions when using it on casino sites.

The Rise of Crypto Dice Casino Sites

What exactly are crypto dice casino sites, and why are they gaining popularity?

Crypto dice casinos are online gambling platforms that solely accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

These innovative sites offer dice games that provide players with a simple yet thrilling way to test their luck.

It's beneficial to check if the crypto dice casino site employs provably fair technology. This technology allows players to verify the fairness of each game's outcome, ensuring that the results are not manipulated.

By choosing a platform that utilizes provably fair systems, you can trust that your gaming experience is free from any form of cheating or bias.

Assessing the Variety of Games and Betting Options

Crypto dice games are online gambling games where players bet on the outcome of a dice roll using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. These games typically involve predicting whether the result of a dice roll will be above or below a certain number.

2. How do crypto dice sites ensure fairness?

Most reputable crypto dice sites use a ""provably fair"" system. This cryptographic algorithm allows players to verify each roll's fairness independently. It typically involves a combination of a server seed, a client seed, and a nonce, which together determine the roll's outcome.

The legality of crypto dice sites varies by jurisdiction. In many countries, online gambling laws haven't caught up with cryptocurrency technology. It's crucial to check your local laws before participating. Remember, even if it's legal in your area, you're responsible for reporting any winnings for tax purposes.

5. How do I deposit and withdraw funds?

To deposit, you typically need to send cryptocurrency from your personal wallet to the address provided by the dice site. Withdrawals work similarly - you request a withdrawal to your wallet address. Always double-check addresses to avoid losing funds.

6. What's the house edge in crypto dice games?

The house edge varies by platform but is typically between 1% and 2%. Some sites offer even lower house edges as low as 0.5%. Always check the specific odds and house edge for each game before playing.

7. Can I play crypto dice games on mobile devices?

Yes, most modern crypto dice sites are mobile-friendly and can be accessed through your smartphone or tablet's web browser. Some platforms even offer dedicated mobile apps for a smoother experience.

8. What's the difference between automatic and manual betting?

Automatic betting allows you to set parameters (like bet amount, number of bets, and stop conditions) and let the system place bets for you. Manual betting requires you to input your bet for each roll manually. Automatic can be faster but carries risks if not monitored carefully.

9. Are there bonuses or rewards programs on crypto dice sites?

Many sites offer welcome bonuses, deposit matches, cashback programs, or loyalty points. However, always read the terms and conditions carefully, as these often come with wagering requirements or other restrictions.

NFT dApps have become a cornerstone of the Web3 ecosystem, driving significant transaction volumes. These platforms are reshaping creator economies by enabling direct-to-fan sales and automated royalties. For investors, NFT dApps offer exposure to an emerging asset class with potential for high-value transactions.

NFTs are digital tokens that represent ownership of unique items or content on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, each NFT has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. They provide verifiable proof of ownership for digital assets.

NFTs have transformed how digital content is valued and traded. Creators can now sell their work directly to buyers, eliminating traditional middlemen. This shift has opened new revenue streams for artists and given collectors assurance of authenticity. NFTs can represent various digital assets, including art, music, virtual real estate and in-game items.

NFTs are cryptographic tokens with unique identifiers stored on a blockchain. Each token has distinct metadata and asset information, making it non-fungible. For example, an NFT representing digital art includes data like the artist's wallet address, creation date, and a link to the artwork file.

Blockchain records every NFT transaction, creating a verifiable ownership trail. This data is public and immutable. Users can trace an NFT's history from its creation through all transfers using block explorers. Smart contracts automate NFT functions like minting, transferring ownership and executing royalty payments to creators on secondary sales.

Digital art NFTs entered the mainstream spotlight with Beeple's $69 million ""Everydays"" sale at Christie's in 2021. CryptoPunks, 10,000 unique pixel art characters, have traded for millions. Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs serve as both digital art and access passes to exclusive events and merchandise. In sports, NBA Top Shot offers licensed video clip collectibles of memorable plays.

Gaming NFTs include Axie Infinity's breedable creatures and Decentraland's virtual land parcels. Music NFTs from Kings of Leon and Grimes offer exclusive content and experiences. Virtual fashion NFTs by Gucci have sold in online environments. Twitter's founder sold his first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million.

dApps are software programs that run on blockchain networks rather than centralized servers. They operate on peer-to-peer networks, eliminating the need for intermediaries. dApps leverage smart contracts to automate processes and ensure transparent, trustless interactions.

dApps increase security through blockchain's immutable nature. They also enhance privacy as users maintain control of their data. Finally, dApps improve transparency because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger.

dApps operate on blockchain networks, using smart contracts to automate processes without central authorities. Their open-source code allows public review and encourages community contributions. dApps use native tokens or cryptocurrencies for in-app transactions and governance. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake or Proof of Work validate transactions and maintain network integrity. These applications store immutable transaction records on the blockchain, boosting transparency and security.

Many dApps integrate with Web3 wallets for user authentication and transactions. They often utilize decentralized storage solutions to store and retrieve data. Tokenomics models incentivize user participation and network growth in many dApps. Interoperability protocols allow dApps to connect across blockchains, expanding their utility.

NFT dApps help users to create, buy, sell and trade unique digital assets without intermediaries. These platforms combine NFT scarcity and authenticity with dApp decentralization for peer-to-peer transactions.

Smart contracts in NFT dApps automate minting, ownership transfers and royalty management. This creates new digital ownership models across industries. Artists sell directly to collectors, gamers trade in-game items, and users buy virtual real estate in metaverses. NFT dApps are reshaping markets in art, gaming and entertainment, while opening new investment opportunities in the digital space.

NFT dApps can be categorized based on their primary functions and the industries they cater to. The main types include marketplace dApps, gaming dApps, art and collectible dApps, and social and metaverse dApps. Each type offers unique features and benefits to users in the NFT ecosystem.

NFT marketplace dApps let users mint, buy, sell and trade NFTs on blockchain networks. These platforms use smart contracts to automate listings, auctions and instant sales without intermediaries. They verify ownership, manage royalties and provide secure storage for digital assets.

In the blockchain ecosystem, NFT marketplaces create liquidity for digital assets. They connect creators directly with collectors, creating new economic models for digital content. These dApps support standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 on Ethereum, as well as other blockchain-specific formats. This allows users to trade NFTs created on different networks, increasing market reach and asset liquidity.

OpenSea leads the NFT marketplace space with $37.33 billion in trading volume. Blur has risen as a strong competitor, achieving $11 billion in volume. LooksRare and Magic Eden follow, each with $4 billion in trading volume. Another popular platform is Rarible, which recently partnered with Forbes Web3 to conduct a Web3 art contest spotlighting emerging digital artists. SuperRare is also a notable marketplace, focusing on high-end digital art NFTs.

Gaming dApps integrate NFTs as in-game assets, allowing players to truly own and trade their virtual items. This model, often called ""play-to-earn,"" enables gamers to monetize their time and skills within the game ecosystem. NFTs in gaming can represent characters, weapons, land or other tradable assets.

The Sandbox offers a virtual world for building and monetizing experiences. Alien Worlds features NFT-based mining and combat. Gods Unchained gives players ownership of digital trading cards. Sorare focuses on fantasy football with NFT player cards.

Art and collectible dApps focus on creating, showcasing and trading digital art and unique collectibles as NFTs. These platforms provide artists with new ways to monetize their work and offer collectors verifiable ownership of digital assets. They often include features like provenance tracking and royalty distribution.

Foundation operates as a decentralized platform for artists to mint and auction digital artworks. SuperRare runs on Ethereum, allowing artists to tokenize and sell single-edition artworks. Rarible enables community-governed creation and trading of NFTs.

Social and metaverse dApps use NFTs to represent digital identity, social status or ownership within virtual worlds. These platforms aim to create immersive digital experiences where users can interact, socialize and engage in various activities using NFT-based assets.

The Sandbox has sold virtual land parcels, allowing users to create and monetize experiences. Decentraland hosts virtual events and allows users to buy and develop digital real estate. Somnium Space offers a VR-compatible metaverse where users own and trade virtual properties. Cryptovoxels provides a blockchain-based world where users can build and showcase art galleries or stores.

When a user wants to create an NFT, they interact with the dApp's interface to upload their digital asset and set its properties. The dApp then communicates with a smart contract on the blockchain, which mints the NFT by generating a unique token ID and linking it to the asset's data.

For selling or buying NFTs, users browse the dApp's marketplace and initiate transactions through the interface. The dApp relays these commands to smart contracts, which handle the transfer of ownership and any associated cryptocurrency payments. Throughout this process, the blockchain records all transactions, ensuring a transparent and secure history of ownership for each NFT.

NFT dApps are built on blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, with Ethereum being the most widely used. These platforms provide the infrastructure for creating and managing unique digital assets. The blockchain's distributed ledger records every NFT transaction, maintaining a transparent and unchangeable ownership history.

Many NFT dApps use decentralized storage solutions like InterPlanetary File System to store NFT-associated content. This approach enhances digital asset longevity and accessibility by reducing dependence on centralized servers. The combination of blockchain for transaction processing and decentralized storage for content creates a strong system for NFT management and trading.

Smart contracts are self-executing programs on the blockchain that automate NFT processes. For NFTs, these contracts define token properties, including uniqueness, ownership rights and metadata. When a user mints an NFT, the smart contract generates a unique token ID and links it to the specified digital content.

In NFT transactions, smart contracts handle ownership transfers and payments. They can also implement royalty systems, automatically allocating a percentage of secondary sales to the original creator. This automation ensures that NFT sales and transfers execute exactly as programmed, without intermediaries.

NFT dApp interfaces typically feature galleries for browsing assets, tools for minting NFTs, and marketplaces for buying and selling. Users interact with these features through web or mobile applications. To use an NFT dApp, users must connect a blockchain wallet like MetaMask, which stores their digital assets and signs transactions.

The dApp communicates with the user's wallet to authorize actions on the blockchain. When a user mints, buys or sells an NFT, the interface prompts them to approve the transaction through their wallet. This process ensures secure interaction with the blockchain while maintaining a user-friendly experience. Some dApps also offer additional features like bidding systems, royalty management and collection tools.

NFT dApps provide a way to create, buy, sell and own unique digital items without centralized authorities. These applications enable direct creator-to-consumer sales, automate royalty payments and offer verifiable scarcity for digital goods. NFT dApps are reshaping how we value and interact with digital content across industries, from art and collectibles to gaming and virtual real estate.

NFT dApps distribute data across a network of nodes, eliminating points of failure. This decentralization makes system compromise difficult. Blockchain's cryptographic techniques ensure transaction immutability, preventing alterations or deletions of NFT ownership records. Public verification of transactions on the blockchain enhances trust and transparency.

Each NFT has a unique blockchain identifier, creating an unambiguous ownership record. Users can trace an NFT's provenance from creation through all ownership transfers. This feature prevents fraud and adds value by providing verifiable history. It's particularly useful in industries prone to counterfeiting, such as art and collectibles.

Creators can tokenize and sell their work directly to audiences without intermediaries, often resulting in higher profits. Many NFT dApps implement automatic royalty systems, allocating a percentage of secondary sales to the original creator. This feature enables ongoing revenue from appreciating work. Smart contracts ensure fair compensation by programming these royalties into the NFT itself.

NFT standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155 enable asset interoperability across different platforms. Users can transfer NFTs between compatible dApps, increasing utility and liquidity. This feature allows for cross-platform gameplay in gaming dApps and multi-marketplace trading for art NFTs, expanding the ecosystem for digital assets.

Smart contracts enable programmable NFTs with dynamic properties and behaviors. These can include evolving artwork, interactive game items or NFTs that respond to external data feeds. Programmability allows for complex royalty structures, time-based features and conditional transfers, enhancing NFT utility and value propositions.

Some NFT dApps support fractional ownership, allowing multiple users to own shares of high-value NFTs. This feature democratizes access to expensive digital assets. Fractional ownership also increases liquidity for high-value NFTs and allows for new investment strategies in digital collectibles.

As with any emerging technology, NFT dApps face a range of challenges and risks. These issues require time to resolve or find an appropriate balance. The NFT ecosystem is facing technical limitations, security vulnerabilities, market instabilities and legal uncertainties. Developers, users and regulators are working to address these challenges and establish best practices.

Ethereum, hosting most NFT dApps, processes a limited number of transactions per second. During peak times, high gas fees make small transactions impractical. Layer-2 solutions like Polygon aim to increase transaction speed, but adoption remains limited.

Alternative chains like Solana offer faster transaction processing but face criticism for reduced decentralization. The blockchain trilemma forces trade-offs between decentralization, security and speed.

Smart contract exploits have resulted in significant losses. The Ronin Network hack in March 2022 led to a $620 million theft. In 2021, the Poly Network breach saw over $600 million stolen, though later returned.

Monthly trading volume on OpenSea dropped from $641 million in February 2023 to $32 million in August 2024. This volatility affects creator income and investor returns, with many NFTs losing significant value post-minting.

NFTs operate in a legal gray area. Different jurisdictions classify NFTs differently, leading to inconsistent treatment. The U.S. SEC has not provided clear guidance on whether NFTs are securities, creating uncertainty for issuers and platforms.

In 2022, the first NFT insider trading case was brought against a former OpenSea employee, highlighting the need for clearer regulations and enforcement in the NFT space.

NFT minting of copyrighted material without permission is widespread. In 2022, DeviantArt detected over 245,000 instances of NFT art theft on its platform alone. This creates legal risks for both creators and buyers of unauthorized NFTs.

The relationship between NFT ownership and copyright remains unclear. Purchasing an NFT typically doesn't transfer copyright of the underlying work, leading to potential disputes over usage rights.

The future of NFT dApps is likely to see increased integration with real-world assets and industries. We can expect a shift towards more utility-focused NFTs, moving beyond digital art to represent real estate, intellectual property rights and identity verification.

Improvements in blockchain scalability and interoperability will likely enhance NFT dApp functionality. Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and the development of layer-2 solutions promise to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput. Cross-chain NFT platforms may enable seamless NFT transfers across different blockchains, expanding market liquidity and user options.

The metaverse concept is expected to drive significant growth in NFT dApps. Major tech companies like Meta and Microsoft are investing heavily in virtual worlds where NFTs could represent digital land, avatars and in-world items. Gaming industry leaders such as Ubisoft and Square Enix have also announced plans to incorporate NFTs, potentially bringing blockchain-based digital ownership to mainstream gaming audiences.

NFT dApps are changing how digital assets are created, owned and traded. These applications enable direct creator-to-consumer sales, automate royalty payments and provide verifiable scarcity for digital goods. They're reshaping industries from art and gaming to real estate and identity verification.

Challenges remain, including technical limitations, market volatility and legal uncertainties. However, as solutions emerge and adoption grows, NFT dApps are likely to become an integral part of the digital asset ecosystem, offering new ways to monetize creativity and redefine digital ownership.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66ccc7df714cb76343bf28f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,0.2
How to Start Trading Bitcoin and Gold for Maximum Returns?,https://tradebrains.in/how-to-start-trading-bitcoin-and-gold-for-maximum-returns/,2024-08-26,Trade Brains,"Are you looking to diversify your investment portfolio with new opportunities? As more people explore options beyond traditional assets, such as Forex, stocks, and gold, cryptocurrency has become a popular choice. With the user penetration rate of cryptocurrency expected to rise from 18.78% in 2024 to 22.20% by 2028*, it's clear that many are eager to dive into this exciting field. If you're new to crypto, it's essential to understand that, like any investment, it comes with its own set of risks.

This beginner's guide will break down what cryptocurrencies are, the different types available, and what to consider before making an investment. Plus, you'll get a simple step-by-step guide to help you start your journey into the world of crypto with confidence.

Similarly, precious metals like gold and silver have long been valued as investment assets. Known for their stability and historical significance, these metals remain a cornerstone in many investment portfolios. Trading in precious metals, much like in cryptocurrencies, involves understanding market dynamics and the risks involved. Whether through direct purchases, futures, options, or ETFs, investing in gold and silver offers a tangible and traditional counterbalance to the digital nature of cryptocurrencies.

This guide will also touch on how you can invest in these metals, helping you diversify your investment approach in both digital and physical assets.

A cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that operates without the control of any central authority, like a government or bank. Unlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by a central institution. Instead, they work through a decentralized network of users online. These digital ""coins"" or ""tokens"" are protected by encryption and use a technology called blockchain to keep transactions secure.

You can use cryptocurrencies to buy things online, though fewer merchants accept them compared to regular currencies. When you make a crypto payment, a network of computers checks the transaction to ensure it's valid before processing it.

Blockchain acts as a public ledger that records all transactions. After a transaction is verified, the recipient can access their funds using a private key, which is a secret code. Many people invest in cryptocurrencies, hoping their value will increase over time, similar to how they might invest in stocks or gold.

A platform like XM is great for trading in crypto CFDs like BTCUSD (Bitcoin) and ETHUSD (Ethereum). Facilitated by several advantages, they allow you to trade 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with zero commissions and leverage up to 500:1. Whether you're going short or long, XM offers tight spreads and no re-quotes, making it an attractive investment alternative besides Forex.

Overall, cryptocurrencies offer both a new way to spend money and a potential investment opportunity, though they can be quite volatile and involve certain risks.

Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, minimizing volatility and appealing to cautious investors.

Solana (SOL) is known for its support of decentralized finance (DeFi) and uses a unique proof-of-stake and proof-of-history method for fast transactions. Binance Coin (BNB) is used primarily for trading and fee payments on the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.

A platform like XM helps investors understand these distinct features and use cases, so that they can make a more informed decision. Their Research & Education center offers daily updates on everything happening in the world of trading.

Before investing in cryptocurrencies, it's essential to do thorough research and consider several key factors:

Trading in precious metals like gold can be done through various methods, each with its own advantages and considerations. Here's a simple guide to some common ways to trade in these valuable assets:

Invest in precious metals through mining company stocks or mutual funds. Mining stocks generally reflect the metal prices, while mutual funds are managed by professionals, reducing individual research needs.

Futures and options:

These advanced tools allow significant bets on metal price movements with high leverage. They offer liquidity but come with substantial risk, making them suitable only for experienced investors.

Bullion:

Buying physical bullion, such as gold bars or coins, involves direct ownership. This method requires secure storage and is more suited for long-term investors due to its illiquidity.

Certificates:

Certificates represent ownership of gold stored by a third party. While they simplify ownership without physical storage, they may lack value in extreme situations.

When deciding how much to invest in cryptocurrencies, it's important to approach it with caution and strategic planning.

Limit your exposure:

Financial experts often suggest investing only 1% to 5% of your net worth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This conservative approach helps to limit potential losses, given the volatile nature of the market. It's crucial to never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Consider your overall portfolio:

Your investment in crypto, including BTC/USD should be part of a diversified portfolio. While a small exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can potentially enhance your portfolio's risk-adjusted returns, the exact amount should align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Diversify within crypto:

Just as with traditional investments, diversification is key. This means spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies, as some may have better long-term potential or be less susceptible to market manipulation. Larger, more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are generally considered to be less risky than smaller, less-known coins, but all crypto investments carry significant risk.

Monitor and adjust:

The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin and BTC/USD can be highly unpredictable, with even major coins experiencing significant price fluctuations. Regularly review your investments and be prepared to adjust your holdings as needed to maintain a balance that suits your financial goals and risk tolerance.

When investing in cryptocurrencies, securing your assets is crucial due to the risks of theft and hacking. Here are some ways to enhance your security:

Hot wallets: These are online wallets that store your crypto on internet-connected devices like phones or computers. While convenient for quick access, they are more vulnerable to hacking.

Cold wallets: These offline storage options, like USB drives or hardware wallets, are much more secure since they are not connected to the internet. However, losing the device or forgetting the access code can result in permanent loss of your crypto.

Use reputable platforms: Only use well-known and reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallet providers. This reduces the risk of falling victim to scams or insecure services.

Enhance security measures: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding 2FA provides an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your account. Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts and change them regularly.

Be vigilant against phishing scams: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or emails asking for your personal information or login credentials. Always verify the authenticity of such communications.

Never share your access information: Keep your passwords and key codes private. Sharing this information can compromise the security of your crypto assets.

By taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of losing your investment to cyber threats.

Potential for high returns:

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have delivered significant gains for investors in their relatively short history. This potential for high returns is one of the main attractions of investing in cryptocurrencies.

Decentralization:

Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central authorities, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network. This means they are not subject to government regulations or monetary policies, which can offer a level of independence from traditional financial systems.

Diversification:

Cryptocurrencies can diversify an investment portfolio. They have been compared to assets like gold, as both are seen as stores of value not controlled by any central authority. This makes them a potential hedge against inflation or market instability.

Transparency and security:

The blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies offers a transparent and secure way of recording transactions. It's difficult to alter or hack these records, which adds a layer of security to crypto transactions.

Volatility:

Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, experiencing significant price swings that can be unpredictable. This volatility can lead to substantial losses, making crypto a risky investment for those who can't handle such fluctuations.

Security risks:

While the blockchain itself is secure, individual investors are vulnerable to hacking and scams. This is especially true if they do not take proper precautions to protect their digital wallets.

Lack of regulation:

The cryptocurrency market is not as regulated as traditional financial markets. This lack of oversight can lead to risks, such as fraud, and means there is less legal protection for investors in the event of disputes or losses.

Uncertain future:

The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, both in terms of regulatory developments and market acceptance. While some see it as a transformative financial technology, others caution against its potential downsides and the possibility of substantial financial loss.

What are the risks and benefits of trading in precious metals?

Inflation protection

Precious metals like gold are known for their ability to protect against inflation. Unlike paper money, they have intrinsic value and cannot be produced at will. This makes them a reliable store of value when the cost of living rises.

Intrinsic value

Precious metals carry inherent value, which means they are worth something even without any additional economic context. This contrasts with assets like stocks, which depend on the financial health of companies.

No credit risk

Investing in precious metals doesn't involve credit risk. You don't need to worry about the solvency of an issuer or a company, which is a common concern with other types of investments.

Portfolio diversification

Adding precious metals to your investment portfolio can reduce overall risk and volatility. They often have a low or negative correlation with other asset classes like stocks and bonds, which helps balance your investment risk.

Safe haven

During times of economic or political instability, precious metals are often seen as safe havens. For instance, gold tends to rise in value during times of crisis or financial uncertainty.

Liquidity

Precious metals, particularly gold, are highly liquid. They can be easily bought and sold, making them accessible to most investors.

Price volatility

Precious metal prices can be highly volatile. Factors like changes in supply and demand, geopolitical issues, and market sentiment can cause significant price swings.

No income generation

Unlike stocks or bonds, precious metals do not produce income. You won't receive dividends or interest, which can be a downside for income-focused investors.

Storage costs

If you hold physical precious metals, you need to consider storage costs. Safeguarding gold or silver can require secure storage solutions, which can be expensive.

Supply and demand fluctuations

The value of precious metals can be affected by supply and demand imbalances. For example, if there's a disruption in mining or a technological advancement that increases production, prices might fluctuate.

Economic and political factors

Precious metals are influenced by economic and political events. For instance, changes in the value of the dollar or interest rates can impact metal prices. Additionally, while they are seen as safe havens, they are not immune to price drops due to market dynamics.

Industrial demand variability

Metals like silver and platinum have significant industrial uses. Changes in technology or manufacturing trends can affect their demand, leading to price variability.

In summary, while trading in precious metals like gold offers benefits such as protection against inflation and a reliable store of value, it also comes with risks like price volatility and no income generation. Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions about including precious metals in your investment strategy.

Investing can be challenging, whether you're exploring cryptocurrencies or precious metals. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer high returns and decentralization but come with risks like volatility and security issues. Precious metals, such as gold, provide stability, inflation protection, and a safe haven in uncertainty but involve risks like price fluctuations and storage costs. To make informed decisions, understand each asset class's fundamentals and assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.

A platform like XM helps you achieve this with its diverse range of research and educational content. Balancing your portfolio with both digital and physical assets allows you to leverage their strengths while mitigating risks.",https://tradebrains.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/How-to-Start-Trading-Bitcoin.jpg,0.4431372549019608
Essential Cryptocurrency Knowledge Investors Should Know,https://www.soup.io/essential-cryptocurrency-knowledge-investors-should-know,2024-08-09,Soup.io,"The world of cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities and significant risks. Understanding the fundamentals of digital currencies is crucial for investors to make informed decisions and maximize potential returns.

Unlike traditional investments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks using blockchain technology. This unique nature presents both opportunities and challenges for investors. Gaining a solid grasp of how cryptocurrencies work, their market dynamics and associated risks is essential for anyone looking to venture into this space.

Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies. It is a decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each block contains a list of transactions and once verified, it is added to the chain, creating an immutable record. This transparency and security are key features of blockchain. For example, Bitcoin transactions are verified by miners who solve complex mathematical problems, ensuring the network's integrity.

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available, each with unique features and use cases. Due to its store-of-value properties, Bitcoin (BTC) is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, often called digital gold. Ethereum (ETH) is another major player known for its smart contract functionality, which enables decentralized applications (dApps) to run on its network. Other notable cryptocurrencies include Kaspa (KAS), Bittensor (TAO), and Cardano (ADA), each serving different purposes within the crypto ecosystem.

Cryptocurrency wallets are digital tools that allow users to store, send, and receive digital assets. There are two main types: hot wallets (online) and cold wallets (offline). Hot wallets, like those provided by exchanges like Coinbase, offer convenience but are more vulnerable to hacks. Cold wallets, like Ledger or Trezor, store cryptocurrencies offline, providing enhanced security. For example, using a cold wallet can protect your assets from online threats, making it a preferred choice for long-term storage.

Cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets. Major exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase offer various cryptocurrencies and trading pairs. These platforms provide tools for market analysis, order execution, and portfolio management. For instance, Binance offers advanced trading features like futures and margin trading, catering to different levels of traders. Choosing a reputable exchange with robust security measures is critical for protecting your investments.

Successful cryptocurrency investing requires well-thought-out strategies. Common approaches include:

1. Buy and Hold: Long-term investors buy cryptocurrencies and hold them for extended periods, expecting their value to appreciate over time. Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular choices for this strategy.

2. Day Trading: Active traders buy and sell cryptocurrencies within short time frames, capitalizing on market volatility. This strategy requires a deep understanding of market trends and technical analysis.

3. Staking and Yield Farming: Investors can earn passive income by staking their cryptocurrencies or participating in yield farming on DeFi platforms. For example, staking Ethereum on the Ethereum 2.0 network rewards users with additional ETH.

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, presenting substantial risks. Effective risk management is essential for protecting your investments. Prudent strategies include diversifying your portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and only investing what you can afford to lose. For instance, during the market crash in March 2020, diversified portfolios with assets in both Bitcoin and stablecoins performed better than those heavily invested in a single asset.

The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies varies by country and is continually evolving. Regulatory frameworks can impact market dynamics and investor sentiment. Staying informed about regulations in your jurisdiction is crucial. For example, the SEC's actions against ICOs in the United States have increased scrutiny and compliance requirements for new projects. Understanding the legal environment helps investors navigate potential risks and opportunities.

The cryptocurrency landscape is continually evolving, with emerging trends shaping its future. Decentralized finance (DeFi) transforms traditional financial services by offering decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are revolutionizing digital ownership and the art world. Staying abreast of these trends can help investors identify new opportunities. For example, the rise of DeFi platforms like Aave and Compound has created new avenues for earning passive income.

Cryptocurrencies offer exciting opportunities but require a deep understanding of the market and associated risks. By mastering the basics of blockchain technology, different types of cryptocurrencies, investment strategies, and risk management, investors can make informed decisions and navigate the volatile crypto landscape successfully. Staying informed, adopting security best practices, and learning from real-world examples are essential for long-term success in cryptocurrency investing. Continuous learning and adaptation will be key to maximizing returns and minimizing risks as the market evolves.",https://www.soup.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Essential-Cryptocurrency-Knowledge-Investors-Should-Know.jpg,0.3333333333333333
Bitcoin: A Price History of the First Cryptocurrency (Updated 2024),https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-price-history-first-cryptocurrency-updated-2024,2024-08-09,NASDAQ Stock Market,"Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, paved the way for the cryptocurrency asset class.

Now the cryptocurrency of choice, its meteoric rise was unlike any other commodity, resource or asset. Bitcoin's price rose more than 1,200 percent from March 2020 to reach US$69,044 on November 10, 2021.

The currency showcased its famous volatility in the following year, falling as low as US$15,787 by November 2022 amid economic uncertainty and a wave of negative media coverage.

The cryptocurrency started 2024 just below US$45,000 and has seen substantial gains in the first half of this year. Bitcoin reached its new all-time high price of US$73,115 on March 11, 2024.

So, where did Bitcoin start, and what has spurred Bitcoin's price movements in recent years? Read on to find out.

What was Bitcoin's starting price?

When Bitcoin started trading in 2009, its starting price was a minuscule US$0.0009, making its price movements since then even more impressive.

Created as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, the concept of Bitcoin was first introduced in a nine-page white paper titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" on October 31, 2008, on a platform called Metzdowd.

The manifesto was penned by a notoriously elusive person (or persons) who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The author(s) laid out a compelling argument and groundwork for a new type of cyber-currency that would revolutionize the monetary system.

Cryptographically secured, Bitcoin was designed to be transparent and resistant to censorship, using the power of blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger preventing double-spending. The true allure for Bitcoin's early adopters was in its potential to wrestle power away from banks and financial institutes and give it to the masses.

This was especially enticing as the fallout from the 2008 financial collapse ricocheted internationally. Described as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, US$7.4 billion in value was erased from the US stock market in 11 months, while the global economy shrank by an estimated US$2 trillion.

On January 3, 2009, the Genesis Block was established, marking the beginning of Bitcoin's blockchain, onto which all additional blocks have been added. The Genesis Block contained the first 50 Bitcoins ever created and a simple message: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.""

Many believe the message hints at Bitcoin's mission, as it references an article in The London Times that criticized the British government's inadequate response to the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008, particularly the government's inability to provide effective relief and support to the struggling economy.

On January 12, 2009, Nakamoto sent the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, a computer scientist and early Bitcoin enthusiast. The transaction involved 10 Bitcoins and was a crucial milestone in the cryptocurrency's development and adoption.

News of the cryptocurrency continued to spread around the Internet, but its value did not rise above US$0 until October 12, 2009, when a Finnish software developer sent 5,050 Bitcoins to New Liberty Standard for US$5.02 via PayPal, thereby establishing both the value of Bitcoin and New Liberty Standard as a Bitcoin exchange.

The first time Bitcoin was used to make a purchase was on May 22, 2010, when a programmer in Florida named Laszlo Hanyecz offered anyone who would bring him a pizza 10,000 Bitcoin in exchange. Someone accepted the offer and ordered Hanyecz two Papa John's pizzas for US$25. The 10,000 Bitcoin pizza order essentially set Bitcoin's price in 2010 at around US$0.0025.

Bitcoin's price finally broke through the US$1 mark in 2011, and moved as high as US$29.60 that year. However, it fell back down and remained relatively muted in 2012.

Bitcoin's price saw its first significant growth in earnest in 2013, the year it broke through both US$100 and US$1,000. It climbed all the way to US$1,242 in December 2013.

From that peak, Bitcoin's price began to fall, and it spent most of 2015 in the US$200 range. Its price turned around in December 2015 and began to climb again, and it ended the year at around US$430.

January 1, 2016, marked the beginning of Bitcoin's sustained price rise. It started the year at US$433 and ended it at US$989 -- a 128 percent value increase in 12 months.

That year, several contributing factors led to Bitcoin's rise in mainstream popularity. The stock market experienced one of its worst first weeks ever in 2016, and investors began turning to Bitcoin as a ""safe-haven"" stock amidst economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

2016 also saw the Brexit referendum in the UK in June and the election of Donald Trump to the White House in November, both events that coincided with a bump in Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin continued its ascent, while various industries continued to take an interest in blockchain technology, particularly technology and finance. In February, a group of investors that included IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Goldman Sachs invested US$60 million in a New York firm developing blockchain technology for financial services, Dig Asset Holdings. Bitcoin was trading at US$368.12 on February 2, down a bit from January, but two months later it was US$418.

In May the price of Bitcoin experienced a significant price increase, rising by 21 percent to US$539 at the end of the month. Its price went higher into June, peaking at US$764 on June 18. After that, it fell sharply and spent the summer in the high US$600 range. It dropped to US$517 on August 1 and started its climb all over again.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch partnered for a finance transacting endeavor in September. Not much price movement was observed, but Bitcoin remained on a steady upward trajectory after that. In October, Ripple partnered with 12 banks in a trial that used its native digital currency token XRP to facilitate cross-border payments. Institutional investment bolstered investor confidence, and Bitcoin went from US$629 to US$736 between October 20 and November 20.

Bitcoin's popularity continued into 2017, and it rose from US$1,035.24 in January to US$18,940.57 in December. Futures contracts began trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in December 2017, and Bitcoin began to be more widely perceived as a legitimate investment rather than a passing fad. FOMO flooded the market. What ensued was a frenzy of media coverage featuring celebrity endorsements and initial coin offerings (ICOs) that spilled into 2018.

Regulators began to take notice and issued warnings and guidelines meant to protect investors and mitigate risks associated with digital assets, which only seemed to make people want them more.

Through it all, Bitcoin remained the ""gold standard"" of cryptocurrencies, yet its price was subject to extreme volatility. At the beginning of 2019, it was around US$3,800, it reached nearly US$13,000 in June, but by December 2019 Bitcoin was trading at around US$7,2000.

What factors led to Bitcoin's rise in the early 2020s?

2020 proved a testing ground for the digital coin's ability to weather financial upheaval. Starting the year at US$6,950.56, a widespread selloff in March triggered by the pandemic brought its value to US$4,841.67 -- a 30 percent decline.

The low created a buying opportunity that helped Bitcoin regain its losses by May. The rally continued throughout 2020, and the digital asset ended the year at US$29,402.64, a 323 percent year-over-year increase and a 507 percent rise from its March drop.

By comparison, gold, one of the best-performing commodities of 2020, added 38 percent to its value from the low in March through December, setting what was then an all-time high of US$2,060 per ounce in August.

Bitcoin's ascent continued in 2021, rallying to an all-time high of US$68,649.05 in November, a 98.82 percent increase from January. Much of the growth in 2021 was attributed to risk-on investor appetite.

Increased money printing in response to the pandemic also benefited Bitcoin, as investors with more capital looked to diversify their portfolios. The success of the world's first cryptocurrency amid the market ups and downs of 2020 and 2021 led to more interest and investment in other coins and digital assets as well. For example, 2021 saw the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unique crypto assets that are stored, sold and traded digitally using blockchain technology.

Almost immediately following its record close above US$69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's value began to fall once again. Market uncertainty weighed especially heavily on Bitcoin in 2022. During the second quarter of that year, values dived below US$20,000 for the first time since December 2020.

On May 7, 2022, Curve Whale Watching posted the first sign that confidence in Terra Luna, a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, was waning after 85 million of its stablecoin UST exchanged for less than the 1:1 ratio it was supposed to maintain. This triggered a massive sell-off that brought Luna's value down 99.7 percent and eventually resulted in the Terra tokens ceasing to be traded on major crypto exchanges.

Terra's collapse had a domino effect on the industry as investors' faith in crypto crumbled. In July, the Celsius network, a platform where users could deposit crypto into digital wallets to accrue interest, halted all transfers due to ""extreme market conditions"", driving down the price of Bitcoin even further to US$19,047, a 60 percent decline from January 2022. In July, Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

However, the biggest shake-up to the industry came in November when CoinDesk published findings that cryptocurrency trading firm Alameda Research led by Sam Bankman-Fried had borrowed billions of dollars of customer funds from crypto exchange and sister company FTX. Over a third of Alameda's assets were tied up in FTT, the native cryptocurrency of FTX.

Once this news broke, investors withdrew their funds en masse, causing a liquidity crunch that collapsed FTX. Bankman-Fried was later arrested and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison on counts of money laundering, wire fraud and securities fraud.

Although Bitcoin was never implicated, the fallout of the FTX scandal led to a crisis of confidence across the sector and increased scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement. By the end of 2022, prices for Bitcoin had moved even lower to settle below US$17,000.

What was the highest price for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin set a new all-time high price on March 14, 2024, when it reached US$73,737.94 per BTC. This new highest price came after more than a year of slowly climbing back up from its 2022 lows.

Bitcoin's powerful performance cannot be understated as evidenced by its price performance in the later half of 2023 and so far in 2024.

Concerns with the banking system led the price of Bitcoin to rally in March 2023 to US$28,211 by March 21 after the failure of multiple US banks alarmed investors.

In Q2 2023, Bitcoin continued its ascent, stabilizing above US$25,000 even as the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), along with Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao.

Although it looked like bad news for the sector, Bitcoin stayed steady, holding above US$25,000. This was supported by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund with the SEC on June 15.

Bitcoin's price jumped above US$30,000 on June 21, and on July 3, the crypto hit its highest price since May 2022 at US$31,500. It held above US$30,000 for nearly a month before dropping just below on July 16. By September 11, prices had slid further to US$25,150.

Heading into the final months of the year, the Bitcoin price benefited from increased institutional investment on the prospect of the SEC approving a bevy of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by early 2024. In mid-November the price for the popular cryptocurrency was trading up at US$37,885, and by the end of the year that figure had risen further to US$42,228 per BTC.

Once the SEC's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs hit the wires, the price per coin jumped again to US$46,620 on January 10, 2024. These investment vehicles were a major driving force behind the more than 42 percent rise in value for Bitcoin in February; it reached US$61,113 on the last day of the month.

On March 4, Bitcoin surged almost 8 percent in 24 hours to trade at US$67,758, less than 2 percent away from its previous record, and on March 11 it hit a new milestone, surpassing the US$72,000 mark. Three days later, on March 14, Bitcoin reached its highest-ever recorded price of US$73,737.94, surpassing the market cap of silver.

How did the 2024 Bitcoin halving affect its price?

Bitcoin often surges leading up to the halving events, which is when Bitcoin rewards are halved for miners. The most recent came in April when the reward for completing a block was cut from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin.

Bitcoin often surges leading up to the halving, and several sources cited the 2024 halving as one of the forces that drove the price of Bitcoin to its newest high; however, with only three halvings in history, it's difficult to assertively identify price trends.

The halving occurred at around 8:10 p.m. EDT on a Friday, and Bitcoin's price remained stable within the US$63,000 to US$65,000 range over the ensuing weekend. On April 22, the Monday following the halving, it was slightly above US$66,000.

While Bitcoin's price stayed relatively stable, the cryptocurrency's trading volume experienced significant fluctuations through that weekend, with a 45 percent increase from April 19 to April 20 followed by a 68 percent decline on April 21. Between April 30 and May 3, it fell as low as US$56,903 following the Federal Reserve's April policy meeting, which did not produce a rate cut.

Reports that the SEC was moving to approve spot Ether ETFs in May sent the price of Bitcoin climbing again alongside that of Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which serves as the foundation for these ETFs. Bitcoin passed US$71,000 for the second time ever at 8:00 p.m. EDT on May 20, days before the SEC approved spot Ether ETFs on May 23.

Bitcoin hovered between US$67,000 and US$69,000 for the remainder of the month and into the middle of June. It fell back below US$67,000 on June 13 and moved lower the next day when the Federal Reserve opted to delay lowering interest rates once again.

Losses picked up speed through late June and continued in July, with analysts pointing to uncertainty over post-election regulations, Germany's sell-off of seized Bitcoin assets and concerns about the impact of the defunct trading platform Mt. Gox on the token market. Bitcoin dropped to a two-month low of US$55,880 on July 8, but quickly recovered most of its losses after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony on July 9 that signaled rate cuts may not be far off.

As crypto gains wider acceptance and accessibility, with more traditional financial institutions and products incorporating digital assets, the type of risk that Bitcoin represents has evolved. Bitcoin was primarily seen as a highly speculative alternative investment. Now, with expanding institutional interest, it is increasingly seen as a ""risk-on"" asset - meaning its price movements are influenced by market sentiment, investor confidence and broader economic conditions.

A rise in Bitcoin's price ensued after the July 13 assassination attempt of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has been actively endorsing the crypto industry for support. Bitcoin rose from US$57,899 to US$66,690 in the week following the incident as the odds of a Trump victory were seen to improve, highlighting the impact of regulatory uncertainty on the market. However, Bitcoin's price didn't experience any significant pullbacks in the week after current US President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and current Vice President Kamala Harris took over as the new nominee.

Other significant developments affecting Bitcoin during recent weeks include the underwhelming performance of spot Ether ETFs, fears of a US government Bitcoin sell-off, Trump's proposed national Bitcoin stockpile and Trump's declining chances of winning the election as support for Harris snowballs. The biggest driver of price volatility came in early August when an economic scare triggered a significant sell-off event across many global markets and cryptocurrencies.

What is Bitcoin at today?

As of 4:00 p.m. EDT on August 8, Bitcoin was valued at US$59,490, having partially recovered from the deep losses it incurred in early August.

The price of Bitcoin fell alongside digital assets and the broader stock market on August 5 in a sell-off event triggered by a series of events including weaker-than-expected economic data the prior Thursday (August 2). An unexpected interest rate hike in Japan on July 31 resulting in an unwinding in Yen carry trades also contributed, with Asian markets experiencing sell-offs not seen since the pandemic. Panic in the Asian market heightened fears that the US was headed into a recession, prompting investors to liquidate high-risk assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin lost over 18 percent of its value in a 24-hour period, briefly dipping below US$50,000 for the first time since February. However, after the initial sell-off, the market began to stabilize as investors took a more measured approach to assessing the long-term implications of the economic data.

A blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions.

Blockchains are constantly growing as completed blocks are recorded and added in chronological order. The mechanism by which digital currencies are mined, blockchain has become a popular investment space as the technology is increasingly being implemented in business processes across a variety of industries. These include banking, cybersecurity, networking, supply chain management, the Internet of Things, online music, healthcare and insurance.

How to buy Bitcoin?

Bitcoin can be purchased through a variety of crypto exchange platforms and peer-to-peer crypto trading apps, and then held in a digital wallet. These include Coinbase Global, CoinSmart Financial (OTC Pink:CONMF,NEO:SMRT), BlockFi, Binance and Gemini.

What is the Bitcoin halving?

Unlike traditional currencies that can increase circulation through printing, the number of Bitcoins is finite. This limit is a core function of Bitcoin's algorithm and was designed to offset inflation by maintaining scarcity. There are 21 million in existence, of which 19,787,175 are in circulation as of August 8. This means there are 1,212,825 still unmined.

A new Bitcoin is created when a Bitcoin miner uses highly specialized software to complete a block of transaction verifications on the Bitcoin blockchain. Roughly 900 Bitcoins are currently mined per day; however, after 210,000 blocks are completed, a Bitcoin protocol called a halving automatically reduces the number of new coins issued by half. Halving not only counteracts inflation but also supports the cryptocurrency's value by ensuring that its price will increase if demand remains the same.

Halvings have occurred every four years since 2012, with the most recent happening on April 19, 2024. The next halving is expected to occur in 2028.

What is Coinbase?

Coinbase Global is a secure online cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for investors to buy, sell, transfer and store cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

How does crypto affect the banking industry?

Cryptocurrencies are an alternative to traditional banking, and tend to attract people interested in assets that are outside mainstream systems. According to data from Statista, 53 percent of crypto owners are between the ages of 18 and 34, showing that the industry is drawing younger generations who may be interested in decentralized digital options.

Privacy is a key draw for cryptocurrency owners, as is the fact that they are separated from third parties such as central banks. Additionally, crypto transactions, including purchases, sales and transfers, are often quick and have fewer associated fees than transactions going through the banking system in the typical manner.

That said, banks are starting to notice how popular cryptocurrencies are. As Bitcoin and its compatriots become increasingly mainstream, many banks have begun to invest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies themselves.

Is Bitcoin a good investment anymore?

While Bitcoin has reached new heights in 2024, one of its well-known features is its volatility. Investors who are more accepting of risk could look to the cryptocurrency space as there historically has been money to be made, and Bitcoin is regaining value after plummeting in 2022. However, there is also historically money to be lost, and investors who prefer to take smaller risks should look towards other avenues.

Who has the most invested in Bitcoin?

Satoshi Nakomoto, the mysterious founder of Bitcoin, is believed to also be the biggest holder of the coin. Analysis into early Bitcoin wallets has revealed that Nakamoto likely owns over 1 million of the nearly 19.5 million Bitcoins in existence.

Does Elon Musk own Bitcoin?

Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk's association with both Bitcoin and the meme coin Dogecoin is well known, and both his tweets and Tesla's actions have influenced the cryptocurrencies' trajectories over the years.

While it is unknown just how much he owns, Musk has disclosed that he personally has holdings of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, as well as Ether. It was revealed in September 2023 that Musk may be funding Dogecoin on the quiet, according to Forbes.

As for Tesla, the company purchased US$1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021, but sold 75 percent of that the next year. As of February 2024, the EV maker's Bitcoin holdings were estimated at 9,720 Bitcoin, the third-largest bitcoin holdings for a publicly traded company. In a January 2024 post on his social media platform X, Musk said ""I still own a bunch of Dogecoin, and SpaceX owns a bunch of Bitcoin.""

What Is an Ordinals Wallet? The Top Ordinals Wallets for Storing Bitcoin,https://coindoo.com/ordinals-wallet/,2024-08-07,Coindoo,"The cryptocurrency space has reached a point where things got faster, safer, and cheaper than a few years ago. With the help of certain updates and new launches, each blockchain progresses and reaches new milestones, pushing its entire ecosystem further and challenging its projects to keep up with it.

As the first network and cryptocurrency ever developed, the Bitcoin blockchain is a key player in the industry. However, the technology behind it needed some improvements in order to maintain its place and popularity. Thus, Ordinals came to pave the way for new achievements in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and Ordinals wallets played a key role in the wide adoption of the new Ordinals concept.

So, let's talk about Ordinals and how they work, what Ordinals wallets are, and the best Ordinals wallets you can rely on.

An Ordinals wallet is a Bitcoin wallet that supports the Ordinal protocol. It allows users to store, manage, view, send, and receive Ordinals inscriptions. A Bitcoin Ordinals wallet is often non-custodial, thus offering users control and ownership over their assets.

Ordinal wallets offer crypto enthusiasts the opportunity to connect to a Bitcoin Ordinal marketplace, choose the Ordinals they want to purchase or sell, and basically interact with this ecosystem seamlessly and securely store the Bitcoin assets they buy or receive.

Since the Ordinals protocol was launched, many Bitcoin wallets have been updated to support it, while some new ones have been released, especially for this new concept. Thus, at the moment, the Bitcoin network offers numerous options for those looking for an Ordinals wallet. However, there are some key features and benefits you should consider when choosing your go-to.

First, ensure the wallet you choose is user-friendly. This will improve your trading experience significantly. Regardless of your crypto knowledge and experience, a user-friendly interface will help you focus more on your digital asset management rather than how to find a certain feature in the dashboard.

Then, you should also look for a wallet that has robust security features. Security is vital, and a platform that puts it among its first priorities will surely offer you peace of mind. You can also look for a wallet that allows for biometric authentication or even opt for a hardware wallet.

Probably the most important feature you should look for is seamless integration with Ordinals marketplaces. If the wallet you choose does not provide this feature, and you want to trade Ordinals, what's the point in choosing it?

Bitcoin ordinals can be considered similar to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), as they are digital assets in the form of videos, images, audio files, and other such formats, only they are stored on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Ordinals were introduced in January 2023, after some previous attempts in 2014 and 2017.

The Ordinals protocol was developed in order to solve a pretty big issue of Bitcoin's - the impossibility of minting NFTs on the network. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, it used to be extremely hard to mint NFTs compared to other blockchains, such as Ethereum, as Bitcoin has limited smart contract functionality and is affected by the lack of a token standard specially developed for NFTs.

Another intriguing feature of the Ordinals protocol is the BRC-20 standard. BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens (just like ERC-20 tokens) that can be transferred through the Ordinals protocol. However, the main difference between BRC-20 and ERC-20 or other similar token standards is that the former does not use smart contracts.

Instead, BRC-20 uses Ordinals inscriptions of JSON data to manipulate the tokens. So, if you inscribe ordinals, you get BRC-20 tokens.

Bitcoin Ordinals are a bit different from traditional NFTs, but some elements are similar. For instance, the main features of Bitcoin NFTs include:

Bitcoin Ordinals work based on the Ordinal theory, a concept developed by Casey Rodarmor. The Ordinal theory offers each satoshi an individual identity, allowing users to track or transfer it. These details make the satoshi unique, thus becoming non-fungible.

Let's look at this process closer, right?

First, we have a satoshi. The Ordinals protocol assigns it a sequential number. So, that satoshi becomes sat 49574957410487. Keep in mind that all satoshis are numbered in the order they are mined. So this satoshi is the 49574957410487th satoshi ever mined.

After receiving its number, the satoshi can be inscribed with data (all sorts of files) through a Bitcoin transaction. After the transaction is completed, it will be visible in a special wallet (Ordinals-supporting wallet).

So, since January 2023, we have been interacting with a new token standard on Bitcoin, as well as Bitcoin NFTs. Do Bitcoin wallets support them? I guess we all know the answer to this question.

Both Bitcoin users and wallets faced an issue once Ordinals started gaining popularity; considering the entirely new concept brought to the Bitcoin ecosystem, they were not developed to support the latest type of digital assets.

Thus, some decided to get through significant updates in order to support Ordinals, while other companies decided to build Ordinals wallets from scratch.

But what are some of the most trusted Ordinals wallets?

Ordinals Wallet was launched on February 16, 2023, shortly after introducing Bitcoin Ordinals. It is one of the most trusted Ordinals wallet providers, having almost 500,000 wallets opened. Ordinals wallet is a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, meaning that users are responsible for storing and managing their private keys as well as possible.

Ordinals Wallet's built-in marketplace allows users to discover the Ordinals available and trade them as they like, gathering thousands of options available, with detailed statistics for each one.

Security is paramount for Ordinals Wallet. The wallet leverages encryption technology to secure private keys and transactions, thus ensuring that only users can access their funds.

Furthermore, Ordinals Wallet also benefits from the security provided by Bitcoin, the network on which it is built. This can lead to an extra layer of transparency and security, as well as the much-needed immutability.

Xverse is a non-custodial wallet that allows users to connect with Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces in a safe and transparent way. Xverse supports various Bitcoin-based assets, such as Ordinals, runes, rare sats, and others.

Xverse Bitcoin Ordinals Wallet also has built-in Ledger support, thus offering users the opportunity to leverage hardware wallets to store their assets.

Xverse also focuses on security, providing advanced features that are available to all users. The wallet requires users to set up a strong password and keep their 12-word secret recovery phrase as safe as possible.

Besides, its mobile app, which is available on both iOS and Android devices, offers the option of setting up a 6-digit PIN, along with FaceID and/or TouchID.

Leather Wallet (formerly known as Hiro Wallet) is a non-custodial wallet developed for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based digital assets. It is one of the most popular such wallets, coming with significant benefits and valuable features available to worldwide users.

Leather offers a desktop app and a wallet extension, but according to the platform's comparison, the latter is a better option as it offers more features. With the help of the desktop app, you can only send and receive STX tokens. However, through the wallet extension, you can also send and receive Ordinals, among many other options.

Leather Wallet constantly focuses on security, using multiple security layers to encrypt information. It also aims to protect users' private keys as well as possible, so it has undergone an audit to find the features that need some improvements. Leather is also compatible with Ledger devices.

OKX is a prominent crypto exchange that also offers a Web3 wallet that is available as a desktop or mobile app. The desktop app is available on Windows and macOS, while the mobile one can be downloaded on Android and iOS devices.

The OKX wallet is non-custodial and fully decentralized, meaning that users have complete control over their private keys and assets and need to protect them as well as they can.

The OKX Web3 wallet connects to over 100 blockchain networks, thus allowing users to interact with thousands of dApps and DeFi platforms. It also supports Bitcoin and Ordinals, so it is a good option for those looking for an Ordinals wallet.

MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets in the entire crypto market. It is renowned for its user-friendly interface and strong security measures. MetaMask is available as a browser extension on Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Opera, and you can also download its app on iOS and Android devices.

The intriguing thing about MetaMask is that it is open-source software. This means that developers can test its security and look behind the platform, which increases transparency remarkably.

MetaMask is free to use, offering the same features to all its users. However, just as usual, transaction fees apply, depending on the blockchain you use and the network congestion.

In what concerns security, it is essential to note that MetaMask is a self-custody wallet. Thus, it is extremely secure in case of a hack, but you also have to keep your password and recovery phrase as safe as possible.

Your account's security can be based on the password you set up when signing up. The stronger the password, the safer you will be. MetaMask will require you to enter your password anytime you want to log into your wallet, whether you use the browser extension or the mobile app.

There are numerous wallets that support Bitcoin Ordinals, most of them also being non-custodial, thus offering users full ownership over their private keys and funds. Some of the most popular Ordinals-supporting wallets include MetaMask, Ordinals Wallet, OKX, Xverse, and Leather.

Yes, MetaMask allows users to inscribe, store, and transfer Ordinals. All they have to do is install MetaMask, sign up (if you don't have an account yet), generate your Ordinal address, and start sending, receiving, storing, and trading Ordinals directly on MetaMask.

Yes, you can purchase, sell, and trade Ordinals just like you would do with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). All you have to do is go to a specialized marketplace, choose the Ordinals you want to buy or sell and complete the transaction.

The Ordinals Wallet is one of the first Ordinals-supporting wallets developed, launched less than a month after Ordinals themselves were introduced in the crypto market. The wallet's user-friendly interface and security measures make it an option worth considering when looking for an Ordinals wallet. It is also a non-custodial wallet, another advantage for crypto enthusiasts.

Ordinals have changed Bitcoin's journey entirely, offering the network numerous opportunities. Being a little similar to NFTs, Ordinals can take the form of an image, a video, an audio file, and much more.

Ordinals can be traded, bought, sold, sent, or received on specialized marketplaces, just like NFTs. They also need a place where they can be stored, and this is where Ordinals wallets come into play.

Ordinals wallets provide a safe way to store your Ordinals, usually being non-custodial. If you're looking for an Ordinals wallet, keep in mind that you should look into its security features, choose an option that provides a user-friendly interface, and pay attention to the types of assets it supports.",,0.419607843137255

Amy Arnott: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist for Morningstar.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Arnott: Our guest on the podcast today is Matt Hougan, one of the world's leading experts on crypto, exchange-traded funds, and financial technology. He's the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management, which offers several cryptocurrency-related funds and ETFs. He was previously chief executive officer of ETF.com and Inside ETFs. Hougan is co-author of A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds and Cryptoassets: The Guide to Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency for Investment Professionals for the CFA Institute's Research Foundation. He graduated from Bowdoin College with a BA in philosophy.

Arnott: Well, it's great to have you. We'd like to start out by talking a little bit about your background. When did you start learning about cryptocurrency and were you always positive about it as an investment asset?

Hougan: It's a great question. It really goes all the way back almost to the beginning of bitcoin in 2009, 2010. At the time, I was at a company called ETF.com. I ended up being the CEO of that company. We had a lot of young analysts on the team who were very excited about this new thing called bitcoin. I actually remember having an hourlong meeting the day that bitcoin crossed $1. I have to admit, at that meeting, when I could have easily gone off and bought 100 or 1,000 bitcoin, I was very skeptical of this new thing. The turning point for me really came in 2013 and 2014 after the Winklevoss twins filed for bitcoin ETF. We were running the largest ETF conference at the time, and I had them down to speak. Their lawyer, who is a close friend of mine, Kathleen Moriarty, the first lawyer on the first ETF ever, took me aside and said, ""Matt, this bitcoin thing is not a joke. It's a very real idea and you should spend some time seriously thinking about it."" From that moment on, which again was in late 2013, I started taking it seriously. Eventually, when I sold ETF.com and looked around for the next big thing to do, crypto seemed like it. It's been a great run ever since.

Benz: What were the resources that you steeped yourself in to get familiar with the asset class and to feel more comfortable recommending it and talking about it?

Hougan: That's right. The good thing about crypto back then was that the community was so small that you could have direct one-on-one conversations with people who were really steeped in the space and had been for years. There were a few books on the topic, a few talks on the topic, but really it was more a first-principles analysis of what this thing is and how it worked and therefore what it might mean for society. I really don't think it was until 2017, 2018, 2019 that you started to see high-quality resources published on crypto in general, bitcoin specifically. So, it was a lot of first-principles thinking -- actually understanding how the technology worked, reading the original white papers, and thinking about what that might mean for the long term.

Arnott: And did you go to some of the bitcoin conferences back in the early days with some of the bigger players and thinkers in this space?

Hougan: No, I wish that I had. I was pretty busy on the ETF.com front at the time. ETFs were booming. It was really more first-principles thinking. It actually reminded me a lot of when I first got connected with ETFs. You all might remember that people were very skeptical of ETFs. There wasn't a lot of high-quality material around ETFs. They were labeled weapons of mass destruction by the Financial Times. And I dug into the underlying of how ETFs worked and understood at a core level the efficiencies they could bring. The same thing was true here. So, I wasn't much in the crypto community because I was so focused on my day job. But I did do some underlying reading and thought about the technology at that base layer. And I think once you do and you really understand how it works, there's a sense of inevitability about its role in the world and how that may play out over years. So that was really what drew me in.

Benz: How about resources today? If I'm a crypto novice or even a skeptic and I haven't really spent much time trying to understand this universe, are there any go-to books or other resources that you would send me to to understand a little better what's going on here?

Hougan: I feel uncomfortable doing this, but I'm going to toot my own horn here. Along with a friend, David Lewant, in 2019, I wrote the first-ever guide to bitcoin and crypto for financial professionals for the CFA Institute Research Foundation. And I think that piece still stands up well today. It's about 64 pages. It talks about the fundamentals of crypto. The reason I like it is it had to run a gauntlet at the CFA Institute Research Foundation of people who liked crypto and people who hated crypto. And as a result, I think it treads that line between what's good about this new technology and what's bad about this new technology. I think it's a good place to start because one thing that plagues the crypto universe is that depending on who you talk to, it's either the greatest thing since sliced bread and is going to cure all the world's evils or it's rat poison squared, as Warren Buffett said, and a tulip bulb and going to zero. And of course, the reality is somewhere in the middle. And what I really like about that document is because of the editorial inputs and having to run through a wall of skeptics, it has a nice balance between pro and con. And fortunately, it's free. So, if you Google ""CFA Institute guide to crypto,"" you should be able to download it. And I think it's a good starting point.

Arnott: Definitely. I've read through it a couple times and it's definitely a very helpful guide to just getting a handle on the whole crypto landscape. I think, if you talk to the average crypto skeptic, they would say, when you say the word ""cryptocurrency,"" they immediately start talking about fraud, scams, bankruptcies, criminal activity. I've heard the argument that the fact that there's total transparency about these things makes crypto look worse than it actually is. Do you agree with that argument that, these things happen, but the actual frequency of crypto-related crime is not as high as people might think?

Hougan: That's an interesting argument. I think there is some truth to that. To me, the big reason that people connect crypto and crime in their mind is actually psychological anchoring. I think for many of us, our first interaction with crypto was probably a negative news headline. It was probably Silk Road, which is a famous criminal enterprise where people bought things with bitcoin that was shut down by the Department of Justice in 2013, or it was Mt. Gox, which collapsed, or maybe it was FTX, which was a Bernie Madoff-level traditional financial scam that was in the headlines. But many people's first encounter is so sharply negative that they anchor on crypto on the far side of reality. And if someone is starting from there, it's really hard to move them over to a more rational view. You can give them statistics that the percent of crypto used in criminal activity is lower than it is for cash. You can cite them, the Department of Justice, saying bitcoin is no longer a substantially good tool for criminals to use because it's too easy to trace. But it's hard to overcome that psychological bias of the first time we heard about this thing.

I think one of the advantages I had, one of the reasons I was open-minded to this, was my first interactions with bitcoin were positive. It was smart people telling me to pay attention to this thing, that it's more serious than perhaps I was giving it credit for. And those preceded some of those bad actor events. So, I think that's a big piece of it. And why so many people have a hard time overcoming that skepticism and taking what I think is a rational view of this space, which is it's not primarily criminal activity. There's very little fraud, and so on. That's what the data suggests. Not that there's none, but that it's relatively small. So, I think that's a major driver.

Benz: One thing that comes to mind though is that Amy and I recently had a conversation with someone who does fraud prevention. She writes about fraud prevention and works on it among older adults for AARP. The conversation was about investment fraud. And we asked her where the main issues are. And she was like crypto, crypto, crypto. And I think the point was really scams under the heading of crypto is the issue. But I'm wondering if you can share any sort of tips for people who are concerned about this and want to make sure that they aren't somehow being defrauded if they are interested in crypto. Are there any red flags that they should be aware of?

Hougan: Yeah. And this is a real problem. In part because the returns in crypto are so high and so volatile that you get these fraudsters promising people high returns. And it's so tempting that I think a lot of people fall into those traps. So, I do think there are a number of ways to protect yourself. One is that crypto is a place where large, established brands and reputations really matter. So, I would not go with a small upstart or any entity. I wouldn't interact with any entity that's domiciled offshore. It's a space where you really want to use blue-chip companies and interact with them directly. Firms like Coinbase as an example, we now have very reputable names like BlackRock and Fidelity, and of course, Bitwise, that have been in the space for many years and established reputations. That is one good way to go. And two is to just have your normal worries up if someone promises triple-digit returns with no risk. Those just don't exist in the world. Crypto has historically delivered very high returns, but it also has extraordinary volatility and extraordinary risk. And if you get an offer that doesn't mention both of those things, then you should run away from it. No one has to invest in crypto, so don't feel forced into it. And if you do, use a reputable well-established provider.

Arnott: Speaking of volatility, we wanted to dig into some of the performance characteristics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a bit more. Bitcoin, which is the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, has had annualized returns of about 60% over the past 10 years through the end of June. You mentioned that triple-digit returns aren't sustainable, but do you think even at like a 60% annualized number is that sustainable, or do you think that type of performance will moderate going forward?

Hougan: That's a great question. I think something like bitcoin is going after a very large addressable market. If you think of bitcoin, many people describe it as digital gold. Digital gold is a $15 trillion market. Bitcoin is $1 trillion, $1.5 trillion asset. So, you could argue to yourself that it could 10x or more just to get level with gold. And I think it could eventually get there. I don't think we're necessarily in store for the same kind of returns we've seen historically. Bitcoin started at a very low level. There's a huge amount of skepticism and that's changed. Right now, BlackRock is in the space. Now it's very institutionally accepted. So, it's been derisked to some degree and therefore you'd expect the returns to be lower. But I do still think the asset has a long way to run over the long term. And you could get years with multiple hundreds of percent returns. It's certainly possible. But you'll also see significant volatility. I think that's the important thing. There is still really a lot of room to run. It is still early, but that opportunity is paired with volatility and risk. That's the core message for people.

Benz: Matt, you've referenced BlackRock a couple of times and that certainly was the launch of the BlackRock ETF was a pivotal event in crypto's history. I'm wondering if you can talk about what you think was the turning point for institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency and what do you think led to more institutional interest in digital assets?

Hougan: I will say that I think we're still early in institutional adoption of crypto. I think most institutions are still at zero. A few are now sticking their feet in, and it is growing rapidly. I would really point to the ETF as the biggest single turning point. At Bitwise, we've been working with institutional investors since our founding in 2017. And what they've told us historically is the number-one thing that keeps them from investing in crypto is a lack of regulatory clarity in the space. I think one of the things that the ETF did was bring some regulatory clarity to the space. And I think that's part of the reason you've seen mainstream institutions start to move into this market. But I also will give a lot of credit to large traditional players, like Fidelity and BlackRock, many of which were previously skeptical of the space but spent time studying it and came to realize that it has a role to play in society and so it shifted their stance. But I do think the ETF and emerging regulatory clarity is probably the key piece that has made it OK for institutions to find this asset class interesting.

Arnott: Despite the ETF launches and some institutions dipping their toes into the space, there are also some high-profile investors like Goldman Sachs and Vanguard, Warren Buffett, and so on, who are still very negative about Bitcoin. Is that a case of TradFi being resistant to change or just not understanding the potential or do you think there are other factors going on?

Hougan: I think there are really two factors there. So, the biggest one is TradFi being resistant to change and being unwilling to underwrite this new technology and asset. And again, it reminds me a lot of ETFs. Vanguard was very skeptical of ETFs as an example, and now it's one of their largest business lines. And we've seen that time and time again. It's hard for people to get their hands and their heads around new things. And I think that's a big piece of it. The other piece of it that you see Warren Buffett and Vanguard really struggling with is understanding how an asset that doesn't have cash flow can have value. That's what Buffett has said is his primary criticism of bitcoin. It's the same criticism he levels at gold, which is how does this asset that doesn't have any cash flow have trillions of dollars in value? I think there's a very good answer to that. I'd say Vanguard will eventually realize that answer, but to date they haven't. And I think that's a hurdle that they have to overcome.

Benz: Going back to this narrative of bitcoin as digital gold. Gold has traditionally performed very well as a safe haven during periods of market crisis. But bitcoin hasn't shared that characteristic. So, can you talk about that, whether you think that that comparison is a reasonable starting point for thinking about the potential role of crypto in a portfolio?

Hougan: Absolutely. I think when you talk about bitcoin as potentially being digital gold, what you're saying is it has fundamental characteristics in common with gold that are important to society. And those fundamental characteristics are it's a nonsovereign store of wealth with believable scarcity that people around the world use to park value in it. And I think bitcoin really does offer that. It's not controlled by any government. It's a fixed auditory policy. It's accepted in hundreds of countries around the world. And I really do think it fits that characteristic of digital gold. And what you would therefore expect is that as it matures as an asset, it should be a way to avoid or step out of the risks of monetary inflation that impact other assets. And I think from that perspective, bitcoin has done a great job. Since the start of covid, the US dollar has lost 25% of its value. Bitcoin is up 600% or 700% since then.

So, it's done a good job of shielding you from the inflation that afflicted us in the post-covid era. It's not yet playing the exact same role as gold. Gold is often, many people believe a short-term flight to quality asset when people have a panic moment in the market. They may buy US short-term Treasuries or they may buy gold. Bitcoin still has a lot of risk associated with it. So, it's not a natural place to go hide in the very short term. But I do think it's playing that long-term diversifying role in a portfolio and that long-term inflation hedge. That's what I see in the data. And I think as it matures, it will become more goldlike in nature. But that's a process that will take 10, 20, maybe more years.

Arnott: You mentioned crypto playing a diversifying role in portfolios and it has definitely done that to date. It's historically had very low correlations with traditional asset classes. But we have seen correlations trend a bit higher in recent years. I think if you look at the most recent 12-month period, it's about 0.36 versus equities. Do you think those correlation trends will continue to move higher?

Hougan: Mostly no. Maybe incrementally higher versus history. And the reason it would be incrementally higher is becoming part of the financial firmament and it's attracting more regular flows from professional investors than it did in the past. And therefore, it has a little bit more similarity with traditional capital assets. But if you step back, why does it have low correlations, historically? The reason is that the drivers of bitcoin are fundamentally different than the drivers of stocks and bonds. Stocks are driven by economic growth, by taxation rates, by technological breakthroughs, by geopolitical developments. Bitcoin is driven by education, by advances in regulation, by worries about monetary inflation. These are simply fundamentally different drivers. And as a result, I think the natural state is for bitcoin to be very lowly correlated with stocks and bonds because it's driven by different things. And that really does make it a really valuable asset from a portfolio construction process. It's both noncorrelated and very volatile and liquid. And those are three wonderful characteristics to put together from a portfolio construction perspective. It really makes it value add historically in terms of increasing your risk-adjusted returns.

Benz: How about the volatility for the major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether? Do you think that volatility will eventually decline as they move more into the mainstream?

Hougan: Yeah, absolutely. And we are already seeing that. I know bitcoin seems extraordinarily volatile today, but it's probably half as volatile as it was, let's say, 10 years ago. As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies derisk, in other words, as the big existential-style risks are removed from this asset class, which I think is happening at a very rapid rate, you would expect that volatility to decline. That is what we've seen over any multiyear period. And I think we'll continue to see that. It's never going to be like short-term bonds. But I do think you're going to see volatility continue to decline. And even at the point where it is now, it's not that much more volatile, at least bitcoin isn't. Then let's say the largest tech stocks in the S&P 500. So yes, I think volatility is on a one-way path downward, even though it's still relatively high compared with other assets.

Arnott: You mentioned some of the performance characteristics making bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies really valuable from a portfolio perspective. And, if you look historically, it seems like if you test different allocations, the more crypto you'd had, the better your portfolio would have done, even on a risk-adjusted basis, because the returns have been so high and skewed to the upside. So how should investors think about the appropriate size for a cryptocurrency allocation within a portfolio?

Hougan: Yeah, that's right. Well, I think the answer is unless you have extraordinary conviction. And I would put myself in the camp of extraordinary conviction. So, my personal portfolio has a much higher weight than this. But for investors who don't have extraordinary conviction, I think there's a magic dividing line around 5% of the portfolio. As you mentioned, if you put it into a portfolio optimizer, it will want more and more crypto, because the historical returns are just so high that it boosts the risk-adjusted returns all the way up. But something funny happens at around 5% on a historical basis, which is that crypto becomes the primary driver of the maximum drawdown of the portfolio. The maximum drawdown, of course, is the biggest fall from a peak to a trough in what your total portfolio value is. And to me, that's a really important statistic, because that's the statistic that investors feel in their gut. And that's the statistics that makes investors panic. And actually, the single biggest risk in crypto is not technological or regulatory or anything like that. It's behavioral. It's investors panicking when the inevitable volatility comes. And 5% puts you into the risky camp, where all of a sudden bitcoin is dictating the volatility of your overall portfolio. You don't want to do that. I think of it a little bit like hot sauce. Hot sauce is great when you're eating and makes food taste better. But if you put too much in it, it can be painful for people. So, I think if people keep that sort of framework in mind, they'll end up in a relatively good place.

Benz: You mentioned risk-adjusted returns. And I'm wondering if you can talk about whether you think the Sharpe ratio makes sense as a metric for bitcoin?

Hougan: I think you could look more at the Sortino if you were being specific to exclude upside volatility. And bitcoin has a great deal of upside volatility. But I think it's reasonable, particularly when you look at the overall portfolio context. The challenge with just looking at bitcoin idiosyncratically is it has a relatively short track record. So, you don't want to be tempted into putting too much into it. But I think if you look at it within a portfolio context, I think looking at its impact on the Sharpe ratio of the overall portfolio or the Sortino ratio, if you want to be more specific, I think that's a relatively good way of understanding its impact.

Arnott: So, if I'm an investor who holds cryptocurrency, should I be viewing it in the context of my regular portfolio alongside traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds? Or given the volatility and the potential upside, do you think people should hold it off to the side as a separate portfolio or more speculative asset?

Hougan: Well, I think the answer comes down to whether you think it has a risk of going to zero. So, if you think it has a risk of going to zero, it's a good idea to side pocket it and just consider it a speculative bet that may have a great long-term impact on your portfolio. But if you can gain conviction that it's not going to zero, then adding it to your traditional portfolio transforms it into this incredible asset. And the reason that's the case is because if you add it to your traditional portfolio alongside stocks and bonds, then you can rebalance your portfolio and that's what lets you capture the noncorrelated benefits of bitcoin. Of course, as you guys know, if you add noncorrelated assets to a portfolio, but don't rebalance, it doesn't actually influence your long-term return pattern very much.

It just smudges it out into gray. It's only when you add noncorrelated assets and then rebalance that you're really able to harvest the volatility. That's where you get what you see when you do historical analysis of bitcoin, which is if you add it to a portfolio, you dramatically increase the returns historically without significantly increasing the volatility of the overall portfolio. I think if investors can get their head around the idea that crypto is not going away -- it may go up and down, but it's not going away -- and therefore add it to a traditional portfolio and rebalance that portfolio. It's arguably, at least on a historical basis, one of the best sorts of portfolio enhancement assets that has ever existed. So, I like it within the traditional portfolio context, but I understand some people like to side-pocket and just let it ride, and I think that's fine, too.

Benz: To follow up on the rebalancing question, what kinds of threshold should people use? How should they determine when to rebalance?

Hougan: We looked at this and the net result of our study was it didn't really matter. We looked at monthly rebalancing. We looked at quarterly rebalancing. We looked at annual rebalancing. We looked at tolerance-based rebalancing, where let's say you decided you want a 1% allocation, and you rebalance if it gets to 2%. Broadly speaking, it doesn't matter. What I would say is the data suggests just do what you were already doing. Bitcoin, if you strip away all the baggage that surrounds this asset class and Silk Road and BlackRock and this and that, all the psychological baggage, it's just another asset. And if you put it into a portfolio context and treat it as another asset and rebalance just like you did with other assets, historically, that's led to great results. That's not a guarantee it will in the future, but historically, it's led to great results.

Arnott: I wanted to circle back to the valuation question. You've written about various approaches to valuation like the total addressable market, the monetary equation of exchange, Metcalf's law or the network size, cost of production, scarcity value, and so on. Is there one of these that you think is the most compelling or useful?

Hougan: It's a great question. The area of research around crypto valuation is a very emerging area and there are a lot of good approaches and maybe some approaches I'm skeptical of. The one that I use the most is just that total addressable market question, which is, we know there's only 21 million bitcoin. How large is the market that bitcoin is going after? Is it the size of the gold market, which is, let's say, $15 trillion? Could it penetrate the offshore wealth market, which is another $20 trillion? Could it play a role in international payments? That's another multitrillion-dollar market. If you add up those markets, you can aggregate up to markets that are $10 trillion, $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion. Then from there, it's easy to see what bitcoin could be if it captures that full marketplace. Then you have to discount back the likelihood of it doing that and the cost of capital. When I do that, I arrive at a relatively high price target, but I find that one to be the most compelling approach. I think it ties into what drives the value of bitcoin, which is it provides the service, which is the ability to store wealth in the digital format without a bank. You can't pay a fee for that service. To access that service, you have to buy the asset. To me, that means when you're thinking about the valuation of the asset, think about the addressable market. If it captures that market, this is going to be an incredible investment. If it doesn't, then it won't be.

Benz: I wanted to switch back to discuss the bitcoin ETFs. Spot bitcoin ETFs now have about $49 billion in assets as of early July, which is up from about $28 billion when Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was the only fundlike investment option. Has investor interest from individuals and advisors been in line with what you would have expected?

Hougan: It's been way higher than I've expected. I knew the bitcoin ETFs would be popular because we were talking to financial professionals about bitcoin, they had told us time and again that they wanted access in an ETF wrapper, but the level of demand has just been off the charts. As you mentioned, I've seen $15 billion of net inflows into these ETFs in the first six months on the market. To put that in context, before bitcoin ETFs, the fastest-growing ETF of all time gathered $5 billion in its first year. These ETFs covering this relatively small asset class have already 3x the historical year-one inflow record for ETFs. It's simply been off the charts. From one perspective, it's maybe not surprising. People love ETFs and bitcoin is the best-performing asset in history to this point. That's a remarkable combination, but I think the scale and speed and growth of these have exceeded almost everyone's expectations. It's been pretty phenomenal to see.

Arnott: There's also been a lot of buzz about the spot ether ETFs that are waiting SEC approval, so there are I think eight in line, including one from Bitwise. Could you give us a quick summary of the investment case for ether?

Hougan: Absolutely. Maybe I'll just take a detour to explain why bitcoin and ether are different, and then that will drive to the valuation case of ethereum. Every crypto asset is two things: It's an asset and an underlying blockchain. The bitcoin asset and the bitcoin blockchain, the ethereum asset and the ethereum blockchain. Those blockchains are just pieces of software. Like any piece of software, they can be optimized to be really good at one thing or another. Salesforce is a piece of software that helps us track sales leads and Microsoft Word is a piece of software that helps us edit Word documents. Different blockchains can be as different as Salesforce and Microsoft, and indeed they are. In this case, bitcoin as a software is a really simple piece of software. All you can do with bitcoin is send bitcoin or receive bitcoin or hold bitcoin or do a few very simple if-then statements. It can move money around the world almost instantly, which is incredible, but it can't jump and sing and dance. Ethereum is like bitcoin in that it can move financial assets around the world instantly, but it can be programmed to do anything. It can be programmed to act like the New York Stock Exchange or programmed to act like your local banker or programmed to act like the Federal Reserve in terms of issuing dollars and money market like-instruments on a blockchain. So, you can program ethereum to do anything.

The reason they have different use cases is because those design decisions make them better at certain things. Bitcoin simplicity makes it the most secure blockchain in the world. And if you're designing digital gold, all you care about is security and decentralization. So, its software is perfect for the digital gold and monetary use cases. Ethereum is not as secure or as decentralized as bitcoin, but it provides this new platform that we can use to reinvent how finance works. So as an example of that, there are these digital dollars printed on blockchains like money market funds and traditional finance. And that's a $160 billion market today that I think will go to $1 trillion or plus, because it allows anyone around the world to access US dollars in a safe, secure format. That's an incredible use. And that kind of use is built on ethereum.

Another example we talk about tokenization, which is the idea that our traditional financial system is incredibly slow. Stocks settle in a day. They used to settle in two days. Bank wires can take multiple days. What if we could tokenize that on the blockchain and instead of stocks settling in a day, they could settle in a second. Those sorts of tokenization exercises are all being built on ethereum. So, the economic case, the reason to invest in ethereum is you think that blockchain technologies could reinvent how money moves around the world, how finance is conducted around the world. All of that is being built on the ethereum blockchain. The case for bitcoin is this case for digital gold. I think most investors are just going to buy them both. I think most investors are going to treat this like any other asset class where you don't buy one stock, you don't buy one bond, you don't buy one commodity, you buy a basket. I think most investors are just going to get exposure to both bitcoin and ethereum, but they are very different. I know a lot of people lump them together. They are extremely different assets and extremely different use cases.

Arnott: It seems like from what I understand, the bitcoin blockchain is fairly simple and basic, whereas the ethereum technology might have much more potential.

Hougan: That's exactly right. And the bitcoin blockchain doesn't change very much. Again, if you're worried about security, you're not going to upgrade your software every few months. The ethereum blockchain changes dynamically -- massive technological upgrades every year. It is a very different, exciting, complex ecosystem. Ethereum as an asset also has cash flowlike characteristics. When you use this blockchain, you pay fees in ethereum. So, the ethereum blockchain is generating billions of dollars of revenue. They really are very distinct offerings. I expect their correlations to fall over time, so there's actually going to be a correlation benefit to holding both of them in a portfolio. And, they are both really exciting.

Arnott: So, if you're buying bitcoin and ether through an ETF, does that run somewhat counter to the whole idea of decentralization that has been so important to cryptocurrency? If you're buying an ETF, is it no longer a trustless system and you have to have trust in the asset manager and the custodian?

Hougan: I think that's true to a degree. And there is a smidgen of irony in the idea of taking this trustless decentralized asset and wrapping it up in a traditional financial wrapper. But the reality is that doing that doesn't change anything fundamentally about the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network is still fully decentralized. It still allows you to custody your assets without relying on any institution if you want. And there are many people who value bitcoin's core self-sovereignty values. That's what's really important with them. The ETF doesn't interfere with that. But there are other people who just value the use case of bitcoin as a nonsovereign store of value as a way to protect yourself against monetary inflation and want to make that investment. And for them ETFs are a great wrapper. I think the analogy here indeed is to gold.

People love gold because you don't need to rely on a government to assure gold's value. And there are lots of people out there who hold gold bars and gold coins. But at the same time, many people want to own gold in their portfolio, and they use an ETF to do that. And there's actually a really fun statistic about gold that I think we're going to see in bitcoin, which is when the gold ETFs launched, many people raised these same concerns. And you said you're financializing gold. But actually, what happened after the gold ETF launched, is billions of dollars flowed into the ETFs and sales of gold bars and coins to individual investors rose at the same time. And the reason for that is more people accepted gold as an investment. Some people wanted to do it in an ETF. Some people wanted to do it the old-fashioned way. And actually, both of those votes rose over time. I think we're going to see the same thing in bitcoin. But the bitcoin ETFs are opening up bitcoin to hundreds of millions and possibly billions of people over time. They're bringing bitcoin into the mainstream. They're bringing more people into the bitcoin ecosystem. Some of them are going to want to buy these ETFs. But I suspect that you'll see a rise in the number of individuals who are buying bitcoin the traditional way and self-sovereignly holding their assets at the same time. So, I actually think it's additive to the ecosystem, even if I recognize that there is this superficial irony to it, which we have to admit is there.

Benz: It looks like about eight of 10 of the bitcoin ETFs use Coinbase as a custodian. Do you think there's any risk there?

Hougan: I don't think there's any meaningful risk there. Custody is a fairly commoditized service in the crypto industry. It's important you have a high-quality, regulated custodian with insurance in place. Coinbase certainly fits that model. I think you'll see this custodian mix diversify over time as the space matures. So, I don't think there's any meaningful risk there. Every custody setup is individual, and it's not like Coinbase is holding all of the ETFs together in one vault. They have individual custody relationships with each entity. Often actually those custodial relationships have multiple wallets. So even Bitwise's ETF with Coinbase, the bitcoin is fractured into multiple wallets. So, from one perspective, it looks like one big thing, but it's not like there's a hole in the ground with everyone's bitcoin commingled. It's individualized and segregated and we feel really confident about Coinbase as a custodian.

Arnott: I wanted to zoom out and talk about some other parts of the crypto landscape. Are there any other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin and ether that you think are worth investing in? Or is it a case of winner takes all for the first movers?

Hougan: The third-largest asset, solana, is really interesting. I think if you look at bitcoin and think about bitcoin as the leading monetary asset in crypto and as digital gold, it has a nearly unassailable lead in that space. The network effects are so large, the security effects are so large, it's really hard to imagine another coin challenging bitcoin to be the digital gold of the crypto world. When you look at ethereum and it's this technological platform enabling tokenization and stable coins, that's more like a traditional technology space. And we know that in the early days of technological developments, leaders don't always win. Sometimes they do. Sometimes you're Apple and sometimes you're Amazon, but sometimes you're MySpace.

And the third asset, the third-largest asset in crypto is an asset called solana, which is a challenger to ethereum. It's faster and cheaper, easier to use and more centralized than ethereum. And I think it offers an interesting design space. I'm enough of a Vanguardian Bogelite to value indexing and diversification as a core value. And I think solana would be a great thing for investors to add to portfolios as a hedge in case it wins the battle with ETH. The challenge for that is, well, it looks likely that we may get an ethereum ETF; we're a long way from a solana ETF. There are other assets as well. Bitwise's first product, our flagship product, is the world's first crypto index fund. And we built that as an offering for investors because this is a new, nascent and fast-developing space. I had a Betamax growing up as a kid -- that didn't work out that well. I used to have a Blackberry and even though I still miss the keyboard, we don't use those anymore. So, I do think there's a case to be made for just indexing this space. But if I were to pick a third asset beyond bitcoin and ethereum, I think solana has a real community, a real shot at mattering in the world.

Benz: You referenced the number of small players that may not fare as well. So, if you look at the data on CoinMarketCap.com, there are more than a thousand cryptocurrencies that have little to no trading volume. Why is there such a high failure rate?

Hougan: It's like any startup. Any startup world, you have a few winners and a few people who do OK and then a huge number of failures. And that's particularly true in any space where there is a strong network effect. If you look at the social media space, there are a few giants and then a few midsized players. And then history is littered with startup failures in the social media space because it's hard to gain the traction to vault into the big leads and overcome their network effects. The same thing is true in crypto. It's trivially easy to start a new crypto project and launch it into the world. And I love the entrepreneurs who are trying to innovate the space and come up with new ideas. And every once in a while, one of them hits. Solana, which I just mentioned, was a startup idea that had a new technological design that was unlikely to succeed. But they tapped into something important. They captured a community and look at them now. They're the third-largest asset. They're worth billions of dollars. There's a huge number of developers and users. They've made it to the big leagues. But behind solana, there are another, 100 that failed. That's just a natural part of any startup economy.

The difference here is that investors can access these startups in their earliest phases. We can't typically access pre-seed software startups in the traditional world. But in crypto, you can access pre-seed-stage startups and you can see them trade and be valued on an intraday basis. And so, we see the failures. These failures exist in any startup ecosystem. They're a natural part of the space. Just like most investors don't invest in pre-seed startups, most investors shouldn't invest in micro-cap crypto assets because it's incredibly hard to find the one that will win. And the failure rate is high, and the fraud level is high. Most investors should focus on the large caps, just like they do in their traditional equity space. It's actually no different.

Arnott: And alongside legitimate cryptocurrencies that are startups but end up failing, you also have the proliferation of meme coins, things like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Dog in a Cat's world, probably hundreds of others. Do those meme coins just feed into the narrative that cryptocurrency is a joke or a Ponzi scheme that doesn't have an underlying value?

Hougan: Yes. Absolutely. I think they speak of something interesting in society, which is the importance of online communities, the power of those communities. And they speak to something interesting about crypto, which is that they allow online communities to coalesce around financial assets and interact in a financial way. But yeah, mostly they're a distraction. Crypto is a really important technology and do really amazing things. If you think about it from a 30,000-foot level, on the ethereum or bitcoin blockchain, I can move $1 billion and have it settle in a few seconds anywhere around the world. It can move money faster than JPMorgan, even though there are no employees of bitcoin and no employees of ethereum. It can move money faster than the fastest financial institutions in the world. That's incredible. It's an incredible breakthrough. It does amazing things. And so, yeah, these goofball meme coins distract from that. They create a casino atmosphere. They go up and they go down. And that's really, to one extent, it's unfortunate. Most investors should just ignore that and focus on these large account assets. That's where the real technological breakthroughs are.

Benz: You referenced the ability to move money around using bitcoin. But do you think there's still a valid use case for bitcoin as a medium of exchange and store of value? To date, it's been too volatile to fill those roles.

Hougan: Well, I would argue that it's done a great job as a store of value. I mentioned earlier that the value of the dollar has fallen 25% since covid and bitcoin is up hundreds of percent. I think it's done a pretty good job of that. It's not a medium of exchange right now. I do think there is a world where it has that use case in the future. If you think society is moving to a multipolar world, and we do see countries around the world trying to move away from settling international transactions with dollars. We see Russia, pushing ruble-based transactions. We see China wanting to settle transactions in yuan. We see the Middle East moving away from the petrodollar. I can imagine a world where international transactions want to take place over a nonpolitical currency where two countries can't agree to use dollar-based rails, or yuan-based rails, or euro-based rails. And they just want to opt out and use a neutral rail. Bitcoin is really the only viable neutral rail that could fill that role. So, I wouldn't write off its use as a medium of exchange long term. If it continues on this trajectory of moving from an obscure asset only owned by cipher punks and people on the edges of society to today, an emerging mainstream asset where BlackRock is building a huge business in it to tomorrow where it's used for international transactions between two entities that want a neutral currency as opposed to a political currency. I think that's a believable story. Are we there yet today? Of course not. But I can imagine us getting there in the future. We seem to be on a track that would lead us in that direction. And I don't think the market is properly accounting for the fact that, that's to my mind a real possibility of where this could go.

Arnott: So maybe we can squeeze in one more question here. What do you think are the biggest risks or obstacles to more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as an investment asset?

Hougan: I think the biggest risks are either behavioral or regulatory. The biggest risks are all human. I see a very few concerns about the technology of bitcoin or the technology of ether or the technology of solana. These have been working for years and decades. They're incredible technologies. What I worry about is people mucking it up. So, could we see negative regulation that slows down the adoption of bitcoin and crypto? We absolutely could see that. The thing I would say, though, is there's a flip side to that, which is if we see positive regulation that comes to support crypto's role in the mainstream of finance and the mainstream of society, there's an equal and opposite upside to that equation. But the biggest risks in crypto are the human risks from regulators mucking this up or investors acting on their worst behavioral impulses and chasing crypto when it goes up or selling crypto when it goes down, instead of adding it to a portfolio from a traditional asset-allocation perspective in a small amount and rebalancing it over time.
